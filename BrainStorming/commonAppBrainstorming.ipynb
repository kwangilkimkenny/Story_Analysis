Usually, injuries, illness, issues with mental health, parents' divorce or bankruptcy, fights, and more would be considered setbacks in life. However, instead of focusing on the difficulty, you should focus on conveying the transition in your mental state, showing how you found a way to stay resilient and optimistic, regardless of your situation.\"\"\"\n",

Because colleges want students willing to take risks to innovate things in the world, writing about your failure can be a powerful topic. Your failures may or may not lead to eventual success in your essay. However, make sure that the lesson you've learned from your failure is insightful because it shows your potential to change the world for the better.\"\"\"\n",

Some beliefs or ideas you oppose are blatantly wrong, such as discriminating against someone. However, for the most part, people simply hold varying perspectives. So rather than showing that you are correct or more logical than others, try to demonstrate how you've been attempting to communicate your thoughts with others in a mature manner.\"\"\"\n",

Maybe you had a mentor, a friend, or even a stranger who taught you to see things differently. You may have felt proud or embarrassed towards the outcome of the event.

    "# doc = \"\"\" Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output basedon example input-output pairs.[1] It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.[2] In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning  algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an  inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to  generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a 'reasonable' way (see inductive bias).\"\"\"\n"

Cyndi cheated on Tom and she began to ignore Tom. He eventually became furious. Back at their house, Tom began to slap Cyndi and she was crying miserably. However, the sun shined upon them when they won the lotto. Both of them were ecstatic and overjoyed with happiness. They where so happy that they jumped around in celebration. Nonetheless, the happiness never lasted too long. Cyndi began to cheat on Tom again and they went bankrupt very quickly. Fights and quarrels continued in the old torn smelly apartment. It really sucked for both of them. Extreme sadness came over them. But then Cyndi bought another lotto and she won again. This time, it was even more money and they were extremely excited. To celebrate the second winning, then went to a casino and began gambling. They were overly excited because they won money at the fancy casino too. Nevertheless, Tom had too much drink and died.
