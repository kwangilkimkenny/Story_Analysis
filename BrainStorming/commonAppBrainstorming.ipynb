    "# For test\n",
    "# doc = \"\"\" Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output basedon example input-output pairs.[1] It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.[2] In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning  algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an  inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to  generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a 'reasonable' way (see inductive bias).\"\"\"\n"

They would walk in the peaceful park gazing at the bright pink cherry blossom that colored the crisp spring air. Then they got into a big fight. Tom began to hate Cyndi's guts. Cyndi cheated on Tom and she began to ignore Tom. He eventually became furious. Back at their house, Tom began to slap Cyndi and she was crying miserably. However, the sun shined upon them when they won the lotto. Both of them were ecstatic and overjoyed with happiness. They where so happy that they jumped around in celebration. Nonetheless, the happiness never lasted too long. Cyndi began to cheat on Tom again and they went bankrupt very quickly. Fights and quarrels continued in the old torn smelly apartment. It really sucked for both of them. Extreme sadness came over them. But then Cyndi bought another lotto and she won again. This time, it was even more money and they were extremely excited. To celebrate the second winning, then went to a casino and began gambling. They were overly excited because they won money at the fancy casino too. Nevertheless, Tom had too much drink and died.

      "result :She is a survivor of breast cancer and a volunteer at the local cancer center.I am a breast and ovarian cancer survivor. My mother was diagnosed with breastcancer at age 35. Her cancer was caught early and she was treated with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, a bone marrow transplant, surgery to remove her ovaries, chemo, more surgery and radiation. After her cancer recurred, my mother had a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. The cancer returned and my mom had cancer  Her smile was genuine, not forced. She is a fighter, a survivor, an advocate for others.I was lucky enough to meet her in person, but I can‘t seem to find the words to tell her how much I admire her. What a gift it is to witness someone”s spirit and strength in the face of illness. It s a privilege to share her story with you I had been out of school for a year, working full time and taking care of my elderly mother. But my mother had struggled with cancer for years, so I knew what it was like to be in the midst of a disease that no one could truly understand. It was a time of learning how to live with uncertainty, with fear and with worry. As I sat in my first session with my volunteer, I felt the same way. Even after all these years I still feel the emotions  My grandfather died of lung cancer at 43, leaving her with an overwhelming sadness. With that sadness, however, came a smile, which I had never seen before. “This is wonderful that you are here,” she said, as I handed her a cup of tea and some homemade cookies. She told me about how her youngest son recently died how she had been volunteering in her grandkids school cooking for the elderly and supporting a womenôs homeless And like so many of us I have to feel like I qualify to be a volunteer teacher of a class in the cancer center because my two boys who sometimes have a hard time reading have so much intellectual curiosity that some of their classmates seem to simply fall over dead whenever they open up to them Just like the young teacher who once taught me how to knit for my kindergarten BFF and then taught another young lady how she could knit like a pro as she learned\n",
