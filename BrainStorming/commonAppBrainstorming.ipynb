Challenges, setbacks, and failures may seem similar in nature. However, an intriguing challenge should be a project, situation, or task that requires courage to go beyond your limitations to increase your capacity as a person.2)Setback : In general, a setback is a difficulty that you encounter regardless of your will. Usually, injuries, illness, issues with mental health, parents' divorce or bankruptcy, fights, and more would be considered setbacks in life. However, instead of focusing on the difficulty, you should focus on conveying the transition in your mental state, showing how you found a way to stay resilient and optimistic, regardless of your situation.3)Failure : People are afraid of failure. However, a failure commonly requires one's initiative or risk-taking initially. Because colleges want students willing to take risks to innovate things in the world, writing about your failure can be a powerful topic. Your failures may or may not lead to eventual success in your essay.
