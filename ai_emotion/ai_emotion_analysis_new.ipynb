They would walk in the peaceful park gazing at the bright pink cherry blossom that colored the crisp spring air. Then they got into a big fight. Tom began to hate Cyndi's guts. Cyndi cheated on Tom and she began to ignore Tom. He eventually became furious. Back at their house, Tom began to slap Cyndi and she was crying miserably. However, the sun shined upon them when they won the lotto. Both of them were ecstatic and overjoyed with happiness. They where so happy that they jumped around in celebration. Nonetheless, the happiness never lasted too long. Cyndi began to cheat on Tom again and they went bankrupt very quickly. Fights and quarrels continued in the old torn smelly apartment. It really sucked for both of them. Extreme sadness came over them. But then Cyndi bought another lotto and she won again. This time, it was even more money and they were extremely excited. To celebrate the second winning, then went to a casino and began gambling. They were overly excited because they won money at the fancy casino too. Nevertheless, Tom had too much drink and died.
