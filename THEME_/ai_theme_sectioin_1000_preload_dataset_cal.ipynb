Vast swathes of corn envelop winding roads and the heady smell of BBQ smoke pervades the countryside every summer. Yet, underlying the trite norms of Normal is the prescriptive force of tradition—the expectation to fulfill my role as a female Filipino by playing Debussy in the yearly piano festival and enrolling in multivariable calculus instead of political philosophy.So when I discovered the technical demand of bebop, the triplet groove, and the intricacies of chordal harmony after ten years of grueling classical piano, I was fascinated by the music's novelty. Jazz guitar was not only evocative and creative, but also strangely liberating. I began to explore different pedagogical methods, transcribe solos from the greats, and experiment with various approaches until my own unique sound began to develop. And, although I did not know what would be the 'best' route for me to follow as a musician, the freedom to forge whatever path I felt was right seemed to be exactly what I needed; there were no expectations for me to continue in any particular way—only the way that suited my own desires.While journeying this trail, I found myself at Interlochen Arts Camp the summer before my junior year. Never before had I been immersed in an environment so conducive to musical growth: I was surrounded by people intensely passionate about pursuing all kinds of art with no regard for ideas of what art 'should' be. I knew immediately that this would be a perfect opportunity to cultivate my sound, unbounded by the limits of confining tradition. On the first day of camp, I found that my peer guitarist in big band was another Filipino girl from Illinois. Until that moment, my endeavors in jazz guitar had been a solitary effort; I had no one with whom to collaborate and no one against whom I could compare myself, much less someone from a background mirroring my own. I was eager to play with her, but while I quickly recognized a slew of differences between us—different heights, guitars, and even playing styles—others seemed to have trouble making that distinction during performances. Some even went as far as calling me 'other-Francesca.' Thus, amidst the glittering lakes and musky pine needles of Interlochen, I once again confronted Bloomington's frustrating expectations.After being mistaken for her several times, I could not help but view Francesca as a standard of what the 'female Filipino jazz guitarist' should embody. Her improvisatory language, comping style and even personal qualities loomed above me as something I had to live up to. Nevertheless, as Francesca and I continued to play together, it was not long before we connected through our creative pursuit. In time, I learned to draw inspiration from her instead of feeling pressured to follow whatever precedent I thought she set. I found that I grew because of, rather than in spite of, her presence; I could find solace in our similarities and even a sense of comfort in an unfamiliar environment without being trapped by expectation. Though the pressure to conform was still present—and will likely remain present in my life no matter what genre I'm playing or what pursuits I engage in—I learned to eschew its corrosive influence and enjoy the rewards that it brings. While my encounter with Francesca at first sparked a feeling of pressure to conform in a setting where I never thought I would feel its presence, it also carried the warmth of finding someone with whom I could connect. Like the admittedly trite conditions of my hometown, the resemblances between us provided comfort to me through their familiarity. I ultimately found that I can embrace this warmth while still rejecting the pressure to succumb to expectations, and that, in the careful balance between these elements, I can grow in a way that feels both like discove\"\"\"\n",

My parents have been divorced for five years and have been at war ever since. I have always been in the middle between two people I love the most who cannot manage to love each other. While I move between the two houses, shuffling back and forth by court order, I never feel at home in either house, with either parent, or in either half of my identity; I can float back and forth but never touch the ground. My mom is Danish and her entire family still lives in Denmark. My dad is Native American and is a Native American history professor. I carry both of my parents\\' identities: Danish and Native. An entire ocean has always separated the two halves of my identity, but a divorce drove them further away. If my Danish mom and Native dad cannot be together, how can those two aspects of my identity be together in me?In my life constantly moving between houses, it is hard to feel at home; hard to feel at rest. I feel like I\\'m in a long car ride, looking at the trees become a blur. It\\'s hard to know what to focus on to keep myself from getting motion sick. As I am whipped around and pulled between my parents, I\\'ve had to find a horizon to look at: something in the distance that from far enough away seems still. The only thing other than stubbornness that my parents have in common is their devotion to academics. They have always encouraged my education and been able to agree on that. Myschool has become my safe place, the window where I can see my reflection, despite the blurring trees in the background. Although the environment of my school can feel constricting, it is also freeing. At school I can work hard and dream about a future where there is stillness, my horizon.While my parents gave me my two identity halves, I have had to work to keep them together; ensuring they do not split apart like the parents they come from. To me, growing up meant the disillusionment of my parents as heros, and the struggle of not being able to rely on them anymore. To survive in my circumstance, I had to mature into the person that takes care of things. I have had to practically wrestle the pride out of my parents to get them to communicate on every little aspect of my life. I have realized that the beauty of my circumstance is that I must work so hard to keep my halves together and the perseverance and initiative I have learned are invaluable.If I can make my parents compromise, and make peace between my warring halves, not only can I finally exist peacefully as myself, but I can reconcile any situation. I now unapologetically take ownership over every aspect of my life.I hope to find a community where I can be Native on my own terms; a community where I can also be Danish; a community where I won\\'t feel shame in one identity because of the other; a community that can be a home where I don\\'t have to pack up and leave every Tuesday and Thursday.A white classmate recently questioned my authenticity as a Native, and another in the same week told me with envy that I was a \\'check-box\\' for colleges. These racist comments highlight the battle I\\'ve been in for a lifetime. My identity and insecurities won\\'t go away, but in my life of reconciling, I have found confidence and peace in myself. Now, those comments are just part of the blur; trees whizzing past me as I continue towards my horizon. I\\'m in motion, heading forwards.When I first saw Columbia, my Grandma\\'s friend toured us around the campus. My Grandma\\'s friend told me her greatest advice looking at colleges was to read the student newspapers to better gauge the students at the school, and how the school allows students to express themselves. While I immediately loved the beautiful libraries and city campus, something else stuck out to me. Being Native American, I am looking for a school that will have a strong cultural center that I can be a part of. After looking through the Columbia Spectator, I noticed an article about the native presence at Columbia, or rather lack thereof. The article, written by a member of Columbia\\'s cultural center, pointed out that the school should do a better job of recruiting native students from many different tribes, socio economic backgrounds, and regions. The article also mentioned College Horizons, which I would be attending in 2 months at the time. From that article I knew that not only would Columbia have a native community I could join, but the native community there was strong enough to stand up for itself. I would love to go to a school that not only has a native presence, but continues to push itself to be better and expand that presence. I hope that at Columbia I can aid this effort and that I will be pushed to be a better version of myself as well. I also think the annual Powwow seems fun. \"}, {\"index\": 1, \"new_personal_statement\": \"High school has been full of immense growth, both academically and emotionally. In classes like English and World History, I engaged in hours of the Socratic method, discussing fictions, primary sources, philosophy, and poetry. While my skills as a writer blossomed into prose that I was proud to call my own, the discussions proved much more difficult for me. Before high school, being a \\'good student\\' consisted of sitting quietly in my chair, listening to the teacher, and dutifully following instructions. As a ninth grader, I suddenly found myself transported to an environment where verbal participation was graded, and the quiet, studious persona I had cultivated was forced to shift into something bolder. At first, I struggled to find and maintain this boldness. I was confident in my own abilities to read literature with a critical eye and make intertextual connections. I could masterfully compose poems and enjoyed lending a listening ear to the continuous storytelling of those around me. But being bold, verbalizing what was going on in my head, this was a separate challenge. During my junior year, finding myself frustrated at my lackluster participation, I decided, like introverts often do, to take a step back and examine why I felt this fear. I had always had a bit of social anxiety growing up, I thought, but doesn\\'t everyone, at least to a certain extent? In an attempt to organize my cluttered brain, I reflected on the times when I had stepped out in courage, and was immediately struck with how rewarding those moments had been. I auditioned and was cast as the lead in the school musical. I signed up for student government and successfully helped lead my school as a Prefect for two years. I was a founding member of a high school. Boldness, courage, and hope. These traits, upon reflection, were not in short supply. Rather, it was the mistrust in my own abilities that hindered my confidence. The confidence I needed to lead, to be a good student and a faithful friend, and to speak boldly when I had something to say. There were just forty-five of us. Forty five timid yet daring freshman and sophomores who took the courageous first step into building culture and tradition. With our large stack of new books in hand and little real idea of what was yet to come, we stepped onto the small campus to start our new adventure. On August 26, 2015 we opened Pacifica Christian High School. The first year was filled with trial and error, leading to many valuable questions about how a school should run. We instituted a student government, and quickly realized how valuable it was to allow input from each member, instead of an authoritarian head. Because the classrooms were still being finished when school began, my Honors Biology class conducted experiments and discussions outside, without desks. In the winter of our first year, we performed the inaugural play, bringing together a diverse group of both athletes and artists who recited their lines with gusto and flair, despite our small audience. We founded sports teams, including indoor and beach volleyball, soccer, basketball, cross country and track, and performed surprisingly well at our various matches and meets. It was a time of excitement and beginnings. We were a small but mighty group, who saw first year challenges as opportunities to pause and contemplate, in order that we might build a school with firm foundations. That first year was a dream. With only forty five kids and seven teachers on campus, everything and everyone was accessible. When faced with a question or concern, I could knock on the Head of School\\'s door and begin a personal dialogue. During lunch, students and teachers sat together and talked about class literature as well as our favorite TV shows. We were treated like adults, and in return, the atmosphere at school was one of mutual respect and ease of conversation. These past years have been full of immense growth, both academically and emotionally.

On weekdays after school and Saturday, Iwould return home to find my dad working in the backyard, lugging lumber ormetal pipes around for his latest contraption, tinkering with some airconditioning parts for his job, or being eaten alive by a car, and go out tohelp him. Sweat would drip down his forehead and neck and soak his shirt. Hedidn\\'t complain. While we worked, our bodies would move in sync with thetrumpets of the classical Spanish music on the radio.When I was little, I settled for simply handing him a tool whenever he asked,but as he and I got older, I began to help him with big stuff he could nolonger do alone. It was often back-breaking work, and together we\\'d gothrough four or five shirts before we were done. We didn\\'t complain. Duringour breaks, my dad would tell me stories of how much harder it was livingwith his family of nine in the Dominican Republic, immigrating to PuertoRico, and dropping out of college to support his siblings.Because of those times, I look at school assignments and problems I face eachday, and I can\\'t think of anything simpler--not just because I\\'m smart, butbecause I know that everything I work for now will be worth it once I achievemy goals, no matter how many shirts it takes.\"}, {\"index\": 3, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Resilience. A buzzword thrown around by guidance counsellors, self-help gurus, and college applicants alike, many people liken it to a sort of inborn talent found only in the likes of the highly successful. I beg to differ.Growing up in the oil capital of Canada, I was surrounded by an \\'economy before environment\\' mentality, where carbon taxes were unashamedly repealed in favour of fossil fuel development. Road trips through the Rockies meant seeing mountainsides littered with the remains of trees, burnt to ash or cleared for mining. I couldn\\'t help but feel a deep-seated sense of injustice\\\\u2014the planet sustaining our very lives was in a losing battle against corporate interests. As soon as I was old enough\\\\u2014a mere nine years old\\\\u2014I started participating in science fair, finding innovative ways, from eco-friendly road salt alternatives to designing safer pipelines, to preserve the environment. Along with volunteering with environmental groups, I was content that I was doing the most I could. That all changed with the Amazon wildfires. It hit close to home after I\\'d spent months extensively studying trees to enhance their resilience to wildfires. As I watched the world\\'s most important ecosystem perishing in fire, the powerlessness I felt spurred me into action. Within weeks, I sold my first art print on Etsy, intending to donate the entirety of my profit. The euphoria quickly disappeared, as more weeks passed and only a few orders were trickling in. Everyone around me was telling me to be realistic, let go of such a lofty ambition. My determination began to waver\\\\u2014would this make any more of a difference than a nine-year-old\\'s science project? But I knew, though we may not feel much impact from the choices to neglect the environment, there were billions of unseen people who were paying the price\\\\u2014whether it was losing their homes and livelihoods in Brazil, or even losing their lives to waterborne diseases in Africa. It wasn\\'t about me or my confidence; this was something far bigger, and I couldn\\'t give up when there was still a chance. I had to help.Over the summer, I relentlessly expanded my business, diversifying my social media pages and advertisements to reach more potential customers. I started a website, adding blog entries to raise awareness and real-time updates of the impact my business was making. This prompted a flurry of online support, bringing about collaborations with like-minded clothing companies and influencers\\\\u2014my cause was starting to get through to people. Before long, I was selling four times as many prints, and several of my Etsy listings had climbed to the first page. Though I was sometimes spending six hours a day coordinating it all, it heartened me to know that it\\'d be making a concrete contribution. As I\\'m writing this, I\\'ve donated over $250 to the Amazon Forest Fund to help combat the wildfires. I\\'ve put another portion towards the global water crisis, my efforts providing more than 200 people in rural Kenya, Uganda, and Malawi with safe drinking water. I wanted to help back home too\\\\u2014it was what had stirred my desire to protect the environment all those years ago. With my donated revenue, nearly 40 miles of Canada\\'s coastline are now free of plastic waste. In the end, I found resilience. What started as a formidable challenge ended as one of my greatest gains. It was second only to, after years of aching to make a difference and months of self-doubt, finally changing a bit of the world for the better. Resilience had always felt far beyond my grasp; in my eyes, it was a mysterious force that could push people to achieve the unimaginable. But I see now: resilience is neither a talent nor a skill. It\\'s an inherent trait that emerges when one has found an exploit so compelling, that giving up\\\\u2014should it ever come to mind\\\\u2014isn\\'t an option. Once I\\'d found a cause that truly resonated with me, it wasn\\'t hard to find the will to succeed, not only in spite of adversity, but because of adversity. So I have faith that my business will go far, to make more impact and change more lives\\\\u2014because I won\\'t stop trying until it does.Inhibit gibberellin biosynthesis? Manipulate soil water potential? \\'Could I even make that work?\\' I asked aloud. I furiously erased, then started pacing again. Some called it creating, others called it innovating, I called it the unscientific method. It was how my science fair projects came to be. At the time, I\\'d gathered my notes, intending to conceive a solution to the imminent, yet still unsolved issue of wildfires. Lined papers congested with writing were scattered across my desk, with some thrown in the direction of the wastebasket to signify vetoed ideas. The conventional approaches of prescribed burning and fire suppression had long taken their place there, as I had opted to take the road less travelled. This road, so to speak, was to combat fire proactively, rather than continue down the same negligent, reactive path. The idea to focus on wildfire resilience had been born soon thereafter. From there, there were still boundless \\'roads\\' to take, but so long as I had the will, there\\'d be a way\\\\u2014my cluttered desk would clear eventually to reveal a solution.Science fair quickly became an outlet for my creativity. The \\'unscientific\\' element was what I revelled in\\\\u2014instead of school labs that had to fulfill a curriculum-themed rubric, I could go where my interests took me. My last two projects have both been formulated from scratch, though built on extensive research. In my sophomore year, after thorough research into a zeolite rock called clinoptilolite, I developed a procedure to extract potassium from seawater, harnessing its adsorption-desorption properties to produce an alternative to chemical fertilizer. Last year, I did successfully design and test a method, one that addressed the two most important factors in determining wildfire resilience. I had devised an original method, rooted in the principles of deficit irrigation, that used gradual water stress imposition to stimulate adaptations developing bark thickness and higher moisture content. My creativity has allowed me to encounter these unique and new areas\\\\u2014Yale published a study just last month finding bark thickness to be key to survival in the Amazon wildfire\\\\u2014that still have great potential for innovative ideas and breakthroughs.Growing up in the oil capital of Canada, I was surrounded by an \\'economy before environment\\' mentality, where carbon taxes were unashamedly repealed in favour of fossil fuel development.

A slight Punjabi woman, she took care of my siblings and me during our parents\\' erratic work hours. Her tight bun, sharp eye, and precise, commanding manner quickly inspired in us a respect for household rules and a fear of the time-out corner.  Escaping from communal riots in India following the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Auntie B.arrived in America as a refugee. Fortuna placed her in an unfamiliar land with a culture and language distinct from her own, and she battled solitude, grief, and a fear of the unknown. It was her virt\\\\u00f9 that guided her in founding a successful organization to help immigrants find work, which she complemented with her burgeoning nanny agency and massage business.  \\'Nothing is permanent\\' she would say in Hindi while smoothing out creases in a batch of freshly washed laundry, \\'But your skills stay with you forever.\\' My siblings and I often listened to her teachings and stories during drives to school and amidst the community service she engaged us in at the nearby Sikh temple. As a playful child who feared chastisement, I followed her tokens of advice but sometimes I secretly wished she would become Maria from The Sound of Music and imagined myself singing \\'Do-Re-Mi\\' on the green, rolling hills of Austria.  Growing up I didn\\'t understand the importance of Auntie B.\\'s unusual combination of strict punishments and inspirational narratives until I studied the political theories and philosophies of Niccol\\\\u00f3 Machiavelli last summer. I centered my focus on Machiavelli\\'s The Prince and his Discourses on Livy, examining his views on the productivity of fear in governing a principality. I analyzed his descriptions of European historical events, including Cesare Borgia\\'s brutal maintenance of Romagna and Oliverotto da Fermo\\'s seizure of the town of Fermo, assessing the ways each ruler used fear to maintain control of the populace. I then created a taxonomy of the various types of fear in Machiavelli\\'s political writings, identifying each according to its utility in moments of political uncertainty and unrest. In addition, I examined the rhetorical techniques Machiavelli himself used when presenting his arguments to his readers.  Carrying out this research helped me discern the ways Auntie B. shaped my understanding of the world.Although I joked about Auntie B.\\'s appreciation of the idea that it is better to be feared than loved, I realized her use of punishments (especially the dreaded time-out corner) not only as a deliberate strategy to maintain order over three mischievous children but also as an informal introduction to politics and power structures.  I found in Auntie B.\\'s stories, too, a reflection of Machiavelli\\'s statement, \\'Everything that occurs in the world, in every epoch, has something that corresponds to it in ancient times.\\' Just as Machiavelli relates historical examples of the Roman Empire to Florence in an effort to bring about the success of the Florentine Republic, I saw how Auntie B. used history to inform our understanding of contemporary times. Her stories about beginning her massage business were meant to teach us about the value of economic self-sufficiency. She intended her tales about helping other immigrants to show us the importance of community strength.  Today, I look for correlations between historical and modern political affairs when examining social policies and work to uphold the values of courage, compassion, and foresight that are incorporated in the power of virt\\\\u00f9 that Auntie B. illustrated with her journey and Machiavelli speaks to in his writings.  Although Machiavelli\\'s political thought is sometimes seen as overly shrewd and did not become mainstream, for me, he offers an uncommon and subtle way of perceiving the world in which history, fortuna, and virt\\\\u00f9 all play significant roles in shaping one\\'s path, a perspective that we all can apply to our daily lives.Every individual, I learned, is \\'Machiavellian\\' in some form.\"}, {\"index\": 5, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I inhale deeply and blow harder than I thought possible, pushing the tiny ember from its resting place on the candle out into the air.

Wish that you can live in India after college!\\' My ears listen, but my mind tunes them out, as nothing could possibly compare to that toy watch! What I never realized on my third birthday is that those wishes quietly tell the story of how my family hopes my life will play out. In this version of my life, there wasn\\'t much room for change, personal growth, or \\'rocking the boat.\\' A vital aspect of my family\\'s cultural background is their focus on accepting things as they are. Growing up, I was discouraged from questioning others or asking questions that didn\\'t have definitive yes or no answers. If I innocently asked my grandma why she expected me to touch her feet, my dad would grab my hand in a sudden swoop, look me sternly in the eye, and tell me not to disrespect her like that again. At home, if I mentioned that I had tried eggs for breakfast at a friend\\'s house, I\\'d be looked at like I had just committed a felony for eating what my parents considered meat. If I asked the priest at the temple why he had asked an Indian man and his white wife to leave, I\\'d be met with a condescending glare and told that I should also leave for asking such questions.In direct contrast, my curiosity was invited and encouraged at school. After an environmental science lesson, I stayed for a few minutes after class to ask my 4th-grade science teacher with wide eyes how it was possible that Niagara Falls doesn\\'t run out of flowing water. Instead of scolding me for asking her a \\'dumb question,\\' she smiled and explained the intricacy of the water cycle. Now, if a teacher mentions that we\\'ll learn about why a certain proof or idea works only in a future class, I\\'ll stay after to ask more or pour through an advanced textbook to try to understand it. While my perspective was widening at school, the receptiveness to raising complex questions at home was diminishing. After earning my driver\\'s license, I registered as an organ donor. My small checkmark on a piece of paper led to an intense clash between my and my parents\\' moral platform. I wanted to ensure that I positively contributed to society, while my parents believed that organ donation was an unfamiliar and unnecessary cultural taboo. I would often ask for clarity or for reasons that supported their ideologies. Their response would usually entail feeling a deep, visceral sense that traditions must be followed exactly as taught, without objection. Told in one language to keep asking questions and in another to ask only the right ones, I chose exploring questions that don\\'t have answers, rather than accepting answers that don\\'t get questioned. When it comes to the maze of learning, even when I take a wrong turn and encounter roadblocks that are meant to stop me, I\\'ve learned to climb over them and keep moving forward. My curiosity strengthens with each hurdle and has expanded into a pure love of learning new things. I\\'ve become someone who seeks to understand things at a fundamental level and who finds excitement in taking on big questions that have yet to be solved. I\\'m no longer afraid to rock the boat. \"}, {\"index\": 6, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'The truth is that fullness of soul can sometimes overflow in utter vapidity of language, for none of us can everexpress the exact measure of his needs or his thoughts or his sorrows; and human speech is like a cracked kettleon which we tap crude rhythms for bears to dance to, while we long to make music that will melt the stars.\\' -Gustave Flaubert, Madame BovaryExpression is paramount; it is difficult; it is a dealbreaker. In my own search for meaningful articulation, I struggle.And every time I struggle, I question myself and my purpose. The answer is always the same: Maybe I can domore. Maybe being just a little bit better at an aspect of my life will change the purpose of my existence throughthe opportunities it would present to me. Maybe. Or maybe not. Maybe our own crude rhythms drown out thebeginnings of a melody that would, in fact, melt the stars. Perhaps our fullest potential is locked in a vault ofdestiny that will only be unlocked with the passing of time. Whatever the case is, I seldom read a novel withphilosophical savviness that captivates me. Gustave Flaubert\\'s endless pursuit of \\'le mot juste\\' (the right word)when he wrote Madame Bovary was essential to the way I approached life. \\'The right word\\' can easily become\\'the right thought\\' and \\'the right action\\'. Still, I knew I was coming up cataclysmically short. Then, collegeapplications entered the picture.The college admissions process has changed me. In terms of introspection, nothing compares to attempting tosqueeze every ounce of your vitality onto an application, aware that the imminent judgement will shape your life.When I began the process of admissions, perfection was essential. \\'Le application juste\\' consumed me and raisednumerous unsettling questions. Will my imperfect high school, a place I love, be a barrier to my admission? Am Igood enough? Will an essay about expressing yourself through an application submitted to that very applicationcome across as distasteful? Luckily, I don\\'t have to answer those questions, but thinking about them was when Ifinally knew: the quintessence of my being couldn\\'t be articulated. In fairness, nobody\\'s can. The process ofcollege admission has transformed me into a person who is more aware of the experiences of other peoplebecause I know how hard it is to aptly describe the value of our isolated histories. We may try, but the crackedkettle of human existence and conveyance is too great a burden. And still, we try. We try because each one of usknows that their individual purpose is noble and meaningful. Once I knew that the soundness of my resolve woulddefine me and that no amount of savoir faire could ever break others out of the prison of misunderstanding, Iunderstood that, in life, the content of my essence is exponentially greater than the content on my resume.Still, good idioms are a dime a dozen. However, meaning is rare and is usually either gone in the blink of an eye ormust be refined by painstaking attention to detail. As I come to this junction in my life and look back on what I havedone, I find myself appeased but not fulfilled. There is no way to adequately express my sorrows or my hopes forthe future, but I know that they will melt the stars. That might be just what a meaningful individual experience is:uncertain conviction. The lump in my throat is mollified by my faith in my own resolve. People are engrossed in thepursuit of solving the mystery of expression, but I think the code might be cracked through resolute determinationto try, no matter how many times we fall short. Because our crude rhythms can melt the stars after all, so long aswe long to do so.\"}, {\"index\": 7, \"new_personal_statement\": \"As I gaze at the stars in the night sky, I am completely removed from modern society.

All the universities I applied to asked a specific question in the form of a supplemental essay. I am king of budget airfare.  A speaker of an obscure African Arabic dialect. I can pass for almost every ethnicity from the Western Hemisphere to the Middle East. I can barter like an Arab trader. I am famous at American Eagle for selling 57 jeans in one shift (2500$ value). I can make the best pot of tea in the world from a sacred ancient recipe my seasoned Berber grandmother taught me. I can make the best smoothie you\\'ve ever had. I speak three languages and flirt in four. I can also get rejected in all of them. I can dance in every Latin style and kill the game on any dance floor. I can hike across an entire continent. I have carried people up Swiss Alps. I can beat any wrestler in New England. Even if it means I break a finger or two. I can make a U.S Army Ranger tap out. I can make 6 Ubereats deliveries in an hour on a bicycle. I have survived every cliff jump I have ever attempted.I am the best storyteller you have ever heard of. I have a magnetic field when it comes to being the center of attention. When I start telling stories even the moon revolves around me. I can do all of this at nineteen years old. I can get into Georgetown. I can change the world.I am incredibly proud and fortunate to be a freshman contracted Cadet in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corp program (AFROTC) at Boston University. I have spent a lot of time on BU campus several days almost every week since starting university. I have been eating in the dining halls, hanging out in the dorms and spending long days with BU students in and out of ROTC. It has been an amazing experience going through the AFROTC program and I am extremely grateful for the support group I have at BU. Their support is not parallel to anything else I have ever been a part of.Beyond the friends I have made, the view from student village, the sandwich station with the egg salad sandwiches and the made-to-order cheese burgers I want to transfer to BU for the faculty. Being in the Cadet Corp I have had the opportunity to be in the classroom with numerous BU alumni and professors. One of these professors, Robert Loftis, came as a guest speaker to share his experience as an ex-ambassador in the Foreign Service. His intelligence and preparedness was obvious for anyone to see, but what set him apart from any other professor I have ever had was his background. From facilitating the first-ever democratic elections in The Kingdom of Lesotho, coordinating aid with the UN to a natural disaster prone Mozambique and running through a warzone in body armour trying to broker peace in the Middle East. Professor Loftis was able to discuss international relations not just in theory but show how it operated in practice.In comparison, my experience with International Relations at UMass Boston has been slightly underwhelming. There are only three professors dedicated to IR within the political science department, and while they obviously have in-depth knowledge, I have yet to experience a lecture that engages with the concepts they teach in practice. Professors at BU have the insight to share what it is like to sit across the table from a King and discuss arms deals trying to descalate conflicts. Their experiences as ambassadors and representatives of the most powerful country on earth traveling the globe carrying out the interests of their nation is unparalleled. As I pursue a career in diplomacy and the state department, I want to know what it was like for people before me. I turned to my friend sitting next to me as Loftis left and said: \\'Wow, I don\\'t know if I am ever going to meet someone like him again.\\' She smiled at me:: \\'Yeah I know right, I can\\'t wait to take his class next semester.\\'Loftis was incredible but the experience of BU faculty really hit me when retired Air Force Lieutenant General Professor Jack Weinstein came to speak. Seeing a Lieutenant General is rare, to begin with, but the fact that I was able to interact with him and gain insight into his position of domineering authority speaks volumes to the dedication BU provides to give their students a living embodiment of the dreams they wish to achieve in front of them. In all honesty, it made me supremely jealous of the rest of the cadets that had the opportunity to study under him.I want an education that would prepare me for what the world has to throw at me, not just the next textbook I would be assigned. My dream is to represent and serve my country well in my capacity as an Intelligence Officer. An education and a home at BU would prepare me to take on the world.I spent four years of my life in a sweaty padded room. I was pretty cocky when I first stepped in there. I would always pick bouts with the strongest, oldest wrestler and I always had something to say. Needless to say I was put in my place very often with little to no care. Call it masochistic. Call it whatever you want but I was never satisfied beating someone who was my size. I was always biting into more than I could chew. I had a burning ambition and couldn\\'t settle until I was the best. Nothing escaped my comfort zone. Even as a tiny 115lb freshman I understood just as well as I do today that what makes a person is the people they surround and compare themselves to. I could never be a state champion if I didn\\'t wrestle and beat state champions.The same concept I used for my state championship ambitions is the same that should be used for changing the world. I would do something very simple that has already been done in periods of Chinese history. The Chinese once used a merit based academic system for choosing government officials. Government officials would take exams for placement into government positions. In this system only the educated could govern.This is the question I would pose to the world in my speech before I changed it.How are we supposed to stop climate change if no one in government has a PhD in Environmental Science? How are we supposed to strengthen our economy without economists? How are we supposed to have world peace when the kings and presidents have never studied conflict resolution and diplomacy? Having a good politician will help you get things done. Having an educated leader will help you get the right things done. Politics should not be a popularity contest. There should be an institution and a core belief in our society (and still should be) to have a first level examination process of basic educational prerequisites required for politicians to run for office. This is the most realistic means to stop demagogues, aristocrats and charismatic maniacs from taking office. An examination process prior to a democratic vote would root out corruption and ineffective governing.When I was nine years old I thought war was the \\'awesomest\\' thing ever. Call of Duty videogames and cowboys and indians were the most important things in my life besides Sunday morning Tom and Jerry cartoons. One day I begged my grandfather to tell me a war story from his experience in the Vietnam War. Needless to say that from that moment on I have never asked him about it again. I have been disgusted and fixated on the causes and effects of war ever since. War is and has always been completely avoidable and unnecessary. There is no nobler pursuit than the prevention of it happening.Cultivating a global mindset is just as important today as cultivating crops or cures. The wars we have, and the resolutions on climate we set today will have a far greater effect than the crops we yield or the cars we build. I know we can all agree that no one wants to trust Sheldon Cooper or Nikolai Tesla (did you know he talked to pigeons? In fact he fell in love with one) with making leadership decisions despite all their brain power. Today I get goosebumps when I see a world leader walk up to the podium at the UN on TV. When I think of the big leagues I don\\'t think of Tom Brady or the Red Sox. I think of world leaders like Vladimir Putin, Angela Merkel, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. Everything from the sanctions starving Venezuelans, to the riots in Lebanon and Iraq are more fascinating to me than any Patriots Superbowl.During my first semester at UMass Boston, I enrolled in an intermediate class having no idea what to expect. There were senior students who had been studying for at least two years who could barely respond or comprehend the most basic phrases that tourists could learn from survival pamphlets handed out by tour guides. The theme I have seen for a lot of classes relevant to my major is that students just take them to graduate. There is little desire to learn and my classes lack the culture of striving to improve.The culture of dedication to the work students put into their studies at American is the reason why I am sending this application. I want to study under and with people who understand that getting a degree is not the end goal. In an era of Globalization we have reached a point in the past century that the actions we take should not only reap rewards for ourselves but for others. In an ever more interconnected world we need to understand that the successes and disasters that befall others will affect us in turn. Americans shared understanding of that key philosophy is what makes me want to attend because I know my degree will have meaning and worth as I take on the world with it.I love coffee shops. There is nothing more satisfying in life than sitting across from a good friend or a pretty girl with a cigarette in one hand, an espresso in the other and a mouthful of conversation.I always get my coffee with half hot coffee and half hot milk. In Moroccan we call it \\'Nos nos\\' which is \\'half and half\\' in English. When I ask for it in Boston though, the barista always looks at me like I have three heads. That\\'s why I go thirty-five minutes out of my way to take the T from the South End to Revere Beach to \\'Casablanca Pastry.\\' Thirty-five minutes is nothing to take me 3500 miles across the ocean to a place I call home. My favorite coffee shop conversations are about the world outside Boston. We live so much in our own little bubbles that we forget what is outside of our immediate concern. Football is great and all. Tom Brady is the goat. I get it. But have you ever seen the 19 year old french first generation immigrant win the World Cup? Did you know that over 225,000 U.S. military personnel are stationed abroad during peacetime? Or that the majority of Americans who support President Trumps muslim-ban dont even know where those countries are.  We talk about everything. Soccer. War. The Mediterrean Coast. Racism. I want to say I know what the coast of Morocco is like. I have been there countless times. However when my American friends came for the first time and we were sitting at a cafe they told me how they saw it completely differently. On one hand it was paradise. The cheap beach with sand perfect for soccer. But they also noticed the children selling tissues and gum for pennies. They noticed the people living between the rocks on either side of the beach. To me this was normal and I didnt see it as a problem even when I came back from America. I grew up poor. Poverty was a part of life there. Coffee Shop conversations expand your mind. My friends and I could debate and discuss these international issues all day at a coffee shop. The magic of University is studying and living side by side with students who share the same love of knowledge as you. In my PoliSci 220 class \\'Introduction to International Relations\\' I leaned over to ask a classmate a question and he said: \\'I don\\'t know man, I am just taking this class so I can graduate in the spring.\\' UMass does not have a school of diplomacy so they offer the major though an assortment of PoliSci classes and electives. The Model United Nations club and my coffee shop are the only things that bring IR students together. I want to transfer to join Occidentals Global Studies program. I want to be surrounded by future diplomats and people who want to change the world. Not by those who want to change addresses.\"}, {\"index\": 9, \"new_personal_statement\": \" Alone, in the rain, in Rodin\\'s Paris garden, fatigue tugged at my brain and eyelids; I hadn\\'t slept well in months, decoding weeks of pre-calc missed during district and regional mock trial competitions, college tours, and coordinating my first gallery sticker sales. Divorce strained my single dad, a West Virginian entrepreneur who escaped from Appalachian dirt. I was getting porky, though I ate little some days. Strength in solitude was my lifestyle - I didn\\'t crave the same shiny drama as my peers. Oddly enough, this was one of the happiest days of my life.You must know, I am an artist. Fear not a cheesy diatribe about my process \\\\u2013 I could care less about melodramatically creating life by swirling a brush. Snoozeville! Rather than some hobby, art is my lifestyle, the way I plate dinner and calligraph school notes, the way I immortalize moments and beloved characters. I see through the vibrant, leaky lens of a Holga film camera, squeezing from daily life\\'s fruits screaming emotion and color \\\\u2013 particularly the color red. Red is my color, the color of love and passion, the color that fuels my fiery outlook, the color I wear on my eyelids and my red-lip-print blouse and my tidy planner and my trademark glossy lips that I use to open court. In Cincinnati, the impenetrable Chrome-Dome I call home, I stick out like Rudolph the Red-Lipped Reindeer. In the garden, brisk rain droplets lovingly melted into the shameless red scarf tied around my bobbed hair. Engulfed by endless mansard roofs, my heart flickered when I spotted The Thinker. I realized I was among friends. With wide eyes, I embraced each of my bronze brothers and sisters, falling and whirling in and out of each other\\'s arms and hearts, thinking and lamenting and stretching, and even painting like me. Staring into the endless eyes of the bereft boy with young hips and the still, yet trembling hand of the old man frozen mid-thought, I found myself among the most intellectually enriching company for the first time in a long while. The moment was a culmination of my past: little Sophia painting in her basement at three years old, preferring drawing to biking at six, trekking duffle bags of paint, canvases and brushes up flights of stairs between homes every two days at twelve, making school history as the first eighth grader to take AP Art, and having just been recruited to build her own 40-foot sculpture garden at sixteen.Art is how I exist. Back in Cincinnati, I stare out my favorite painting window at the gray buildings of my city lost in gray skies. I line the eyelashes of my Renaissance-inspired princess with fresh red oil paint on the tip of my thread-thin brush. I pour my effort towards the future. I crave a future scarlet red, dazzling with intellect and culture and the sun off Atlantic ocean waves, seen on trips from an airplane window, and shiny red lips savoring capers on a spoon of steak tartare. My world will be so vast and vibrant that I need not speculate about cultures that could be; I will only look out my window. As if Rodin\\'s friends were enlivened from bronze to flesh, the lips and teeth of my new neighbors will debate with me, wondering and wandering about our colorful city, and I will again find myself amongst company of the richest intellect.Junior year, I was a Mock Trial coach. With just two more points in the Regional competition, my team would have advanced to State, beating the undefeated State Champions, who placed 5th internationally last year. Sounds crazy, but our coach quit before the first practice. We wrongly expected consistency from her replacement. I decided to hold practice unsupervised when we hadn\\'t met in two weeks. We devised a competition strategy, pairing vets with rookies. Each vet drilled their mentee from different angles with complicated legal jargon. We hammered each witness with possible cross examination questions, and each attorney with complicated objections. We always paused, of course, for the 3:30 morale-boost: our favorite trivia game, The Cash Show. Evolving nervous kids into legal powerhouses thrilled me. We met thrice, four times a week, stealing rooms at the University of Cincinnati Law School on snowy weekends. The Mock Trial family had evolved from a gaggle of Lost Boys to the Justice League of logic and precision. Competition time. Districts Round 1: Best Attorney \\\\u2013 Me.Districts Round 2: Best Witness \\\\u2013 Yousuf Munir (a freshman and new close friend, with whom I would later co-found a Students Demand Action chapter at my school). Next up: Regionals Round 1. Sweat poured through my blazer, but pride and gratitude for our little family drowned out my nerves. I beamed with confidence. Our best performance. Grayson and Allison deftly deflected unprofessional digs and objections, unearthing months-old nuances and obscure rule numbers from far brain corners. Yousuf allowed not one hole to poke through his testimony. Even Sebastian, traditionally emotionless, tapped into unprecedented sentiment, how I taught him to. Our passionate speeches struck the judges like a tsunami to a jenga tower. Alas, we lost. However, my memory of this competition is not of a loss, but of a great victory, as a team player and a leader. As a team player, I helped new friends, who began with bare-bones knowledge of the courtroom, build impenetrable arguments. We came to practice to grow and laugh. I gave my best ideas for the benefit of the team. As a leader, I learned to make something out of nothing.\\'I\\'m the CEO of Allo. I sell stickers with my art on them. Each sticker sold feeds five kids. . . . Since ninth grade. . . . I am sixteen, yes.\\'I founded Allo to help the community in a high-impact, scalable way. While there are many ways to clock in volunteer hours, Allo is uniquely me. Social justice has been at the Necco dinner table for three generations: My grandparents ran and taught at deaf and special needs schools. Dad founded a foster care company. Naturally, I became a social entrepreneur. I am doubly creative here. First, my stickers themselves are creative. They are prints of my best art. Much of my art, including the Allo pieces, embodies powerful themes of social change. For instance, one sticker, Wall Crawlers, is a compilation of photographs depicting three kids at different stages of running up a wall, stacked in transparent layers to show motion. Wall Crawlers, which won a National Scholastics National Silver Medal, is a metaphor for climbing out of poverty through the foster care system. Despite being born into addiction or abuse, kids can exceed expectations with the help of just one caring adult. Another sticker, Be Jealous, is part of the series Fake Feminism, through which I critique \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Facebook Feminists\\' (self-proclaimed \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018fighters\\' who exclusively \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018like\\' angry posts). A young girl thrusts a used tampon in a wincing boy\\'s face. The words \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Be jealous\\' separate them. We feminists need not put men down to build women up. Second, I solve day-to-day problems creatively. For example, Ohio laws pertaining to entrepreneurs under 18 are so vague, they perplexed even the Small Business Development Center. I had to decode legal jargon alone, often slipping through loopholes in order to secure basic needs, like a bank account. I have thought my way around credibility, technical, legal, and even interpersonal issues. One of the hardest challenges I faced was firing my former partner, a longtime friend and Mock Trial co-counsel. Our relationship felt more competitive than collaborative. I learned a great lesson about human nature and creative problem-solving. A \\'creative side\\' is a flawed concept. Creativity pulses through my veins and brain, shaping every query I investigate, every neon color on my eyes, every Mock Trial speech, every Allo decision. I don\\'t have a \\'creative side\\' that shines only in heroic stories. I am just creative. It is who I am. You must know, I am an artist. Fear not a cheesy diatribe about my process \\\\u2013 I could care less about melodramatically creating life by swirling a brush. Snoozeville! Rather than some hobby, art is the outlook I bring to the world. You can see it on my on my eyelids and my tidy planner, on my trademark glossy lips that I use to open court, and in my fiery determination. In Cincinnati, the impenetrable Chrome-Dome I call home, I stick out like Rudolph the Red-Lipped Reindeer. This propensity towards solving visual problems has followed me from a young age. At age three I painted in my basement, preferred drawing to biking at six, and trekked duffle bags of paint, canvases and brushes up flights of stairs between my divorced parents\\' homes every two days at twelve. I made school history as the first eighth grader to take AP Art, where I became close with a Cincinnati photographer. Later, I composed a photo and created the set for one of his shots, which was featured in a jury show. My school\\'s Alumni Foundation just recruited me to build my own neoclassical 40-foot wrought iron sculpture garden at sixteen. I have won a plethora of National Scholastics awards for my work, including six Gold Keys, eight Silver Keys and a National Silver medal. I have exhibited in several Cincinnati galleries.Besides a constant means of self-expression throughout my life, art is my unique value add. The perspective I offer from viewing life like a camera lens allows me to think in unique ways. The difference between a phone designed by an engineer and a phone designed by an artist with an engineer is the difference between a Blackberry and an iPhone. My creativity transcends far beyond a canvas. My passion for using powerful visuals to create user-friendly experiences seeps into every Students Demand Action poster and presentation, every mass demonstration I plan. Some students think scientifically, others economically, others politically. I think visually. \\'If not you, who? If not now, when?\\' - Hillel The ElderThis quote is plastered on a giant wall at Cincinnati\\'s Underground Railroad museum. When I first became involved in the common sense gun safety movement, I was hesitant to dedicate much time. After all, junior year grades most heavily determine my future. I was stacked with weeks of pre-calc missed during district and regional mock trial competitions, college tours, and coordinating my first gallery sticker sales, on top of Walnut\\'s annual second semester chaos. When I read this quote, I realized that student activists like Emma Gonz\\\\u00e0lez were probably busy, too. Eight months later, Yousuf and I co-founded Walnut\\'s Students Demand Action chapter (Moms Demand Action for Gun Safety in America\\'s student organization). We overcame adversity from the Cincinnati Public Schools superintendent, racist politicians, and even our own principal. I made flyers into the wee hours of night, forewent class unexcused to organize walkouts, and canceled personal plans to attend Moms meetings. The tireless hustle amplifies the immense satisfaction of leading a revolution. March 14, we organized a school-wide walkout to honor the Santa Fe victims. In the middle of 3rd bell, almost every student came outside to hear our speeches and wave signs. I spoke for 500 upperclassmen on the football field, while Yousuf spoke to the lowerclassmen on the practice field. There was a caustic blizzard outside, but I felt profoundly warm. Several news crews interviewed me and my team. It was our generation\\'s turn. Immediately following our speeches, we ran to our cars and began the drive to Columbus. I had never felt the winds of change blow so strongly through the air as they did that day, when 300 of us poured into to the Ohio State House, demanding change. Opposing senators canceled their meetings with us out of fear. Dozens more news headlines. Yesterday, at the Club Info Fair, the 71 SDA flyers I brought were gone by the halfway point. A friend ran to make 20 more, which tiny 7th graders quickly snatched, who stared at me with wild eyes, five feet tall. The breeze of change drifted through the doorway. \"}, {\"index\": 10, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Bloomington Normal is almost laughably clich\\\\u00e9 for a midwestern city. Vast swathes of corn envelop winding roads and the heady smell of BBQ smoke pervades the countryside every summer. Yet, underlying the trite norms of Normal is the prescriptive force of tradition\\\\u2014the expectation to fulfill my role as a female Filipino by playing Debussy in the yearly piano festival and enrolling in multivariable calculus instead of political philosophy.So when I discovered the technical demand of bebop, the triplet groove, and the intricacies of chordal harmony after ten years of grueling classical piano, I was fascinated by the music\\'s novelty. Jazz guitar was not only evocative and creative, but also strangely liberating. I began to explore different pedagogical methods, transcribe solos from the greats, and experiment with various approaches until my own unique sound began to develop. And, although I did not know what would be the \\'best\\' route for me to follow as a musician, the freedom to forge whatever path I felt was right seemed to be exactly what I needed; there were no expectations for me to continue in any particular way\\\\u2014only the way that suited my own desires.While journeying this trail, I found myself at Interlochen Arts Camp the summer before my junior year. Never before had I been immersed in an environment so conducive to musical growth: I was surrounded by people intensely passionate about pursuing all kinds of art with no regard for ideas of what art \\'should\\' be. I knew immediately that this would be a perfect opportunity to cultivate my sound, unbounded by the limits of confining tradition. On the first day of camp, I found that my peer guitarist in big band was another Filipino girl from Illinois. Until that moment, my endeavors in jazz guitar had been a solitary effort; I had no one with whom to collaborate and no one against whom I could compare myself, much less someone from a background mirroring my own. I was eager to play with her, but while I quickly recognized a slew of differences between us\\\\u2014different heights, guitars, and even playing styles\\\\u2014others seemed to have trouble making that distinction during performances. Some even went as far as calling me \\'other-Francesca.\\' Thus, amidst the glittering lakes and musky pine needles of Interlochen, I once again confronted Bloomington\\'s frustrating expectations.After being mistaken for her several times, I could not help but view Francesca as a standard of what the \\'female Filipino jazz guitarist\\' should embody. Her improvisatory language, comping style and even personal qualities loomed above me as something I had to live up to. Nevertheless, as Francesca and I continued to play together, it was not long before we connected through our creative pursuit. In time, I learned to draw inspiration from her instead of feeling pressured to follow whatever precedent I thought she set. I found that I grew because of, rather than in spite of, her presence; I could find solace in our similarities and even a sense of comfort in an unfamiliar environment without being trapped by expectation. Though the pressure to conform was still present\\\\u2014and will likely remain present in my life no matter what genre I\\'m playing or what pursuits I engage in\\\\u2014I learned to eschew its corrosive influence and enjoy the rewards that it brings. While my encounter with Francesca at first sparked a feeling of pressure to conform in a setting where I never thought I would feel its presence, it also carried the warmth of finding someone with whom I could connect. Like the admittedly trite conditions of my hometown, the resemblances between us provided comfort to me through their familiarity. I ultimately found that I can embrace this warmth while still rejecting the pressure to succumb to expectations, and that, in the careful balance between these elements, I can grow in a way that feels both like discovery and home at once. Many debate whether Plato\\'s Republic is more important to political philosophy or ethics. To think of the book as political philosophy is understandable; after all, it\\'s called Republic. Yet, these political ideas are stated with the understanding that the Republic Plato speaks of serves as a parallel to the human soul. Although everyone always expected me to study math, philosophy offered an entirely different world. A freshman year reading of The Stranger left me confused, and then intrigued, by the questions it raised. By junior year, my developing interest in philosophy manifested in a decision to take Political Theory over Calc 3 as my first college class at ISU\\\\u2014something that perplexed my math teachers and made classmates question why I was \\'throwing away\\' a leg up in math for some 100-level philosophy class. As class approached, I began doubting myself, wondering if I had made a mistake in choosing the treatises of Plato over the practicality of polar coordinates.The first lecture was illuminating. Professor Rankin said he viewed the book not as a template for the perfect society but as a guide to living well. Plato\\'s syllogisms offered poignant insights about the virtuous life: though our desires often conflicted, they have the potential to bring about unparalleled personal fulfillment if mastered. Throughout the semester, both my understanding of philosophy and myself stretched to encompass new ideas. Plato states that the just soul seeks truth, but to do so they must first find balance between its desires. When I first read Republic, I was sorely lacking this harmony. I was blindly throwing myself into math, a subject I had little passion for. Through Republic, I discovered that I could find balance in philosophy. And through that 100-level class, I found not only that I loved the struggle to understand the universals of life but also that I could lean back on these pillars of philosophy to study what truly interests me. Happiness, I have learned, comes not from succumbing to the status quo but, rather, from finding my own truth. A lot of people can vividly describe the first time they listened to their favorite album. There\\'s some moment of cathartic release when everything clicks and the music feels so closely like home. My infatuation with Channel Orange, though, was a gradual development. At first I simply liked how it sounded. The album is a work of sonic decadence\\\\u2014Frank Ocean\\'s mellow croon overlays a swirl of glittering analogue synths where every nuance of warm mids and crisp highs meld together to produce a beautifully hazy soundscape. Yet with each successive playthrough, I found myself becoming more enthralled by not just the music, but Ocean\\'s lyrics. Each song reads like an entry in a diary, poignant empathy propelling forward his plunge into struggles with his sexuality, tales of black history and criticisms of LA decadence. Yet the LP spans decades and encompass a wide cast of characters from latchkey kids to cocaine addicts, and speak to universal topics of love, loss, addiction, and memory. It was through Channel Orange that I first understood the power of truly listening when someone speaks and the stirring empathy which comes as a result. Music has since become essential to my understanding of these narratives of the world that are so raw and painfully human. Channel Orange taught me to truly consider music not only as its own entity but rather as an extension of a deeper relationship with the world. And listening manifests in far more than just parsing the music around me\\\\u2014now, when meeting new people, I am sure to take in the geography of their personalities before assuming I have already mapped out the topography of their character. Considering more than just the face value and the first impressions of academic subjects, problems, and even people has become a core part of my identity and influenced the way I approach all aspects of my life. After Channel Orange, Ocean retreated from the public ear for an excruciating four years before his next release. Yet even during that period of silence, I could still listen to his mellow croon overlaying every nuance of prosaic beauty in everyday life. \"}, {\"index\": 11, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Tchaikovsky filled the sweaty room of barres and mirrored walls as I plunged into battement fondu. Not to be confused with the sweet sensations of chocolate fondue, this ballet exercise requires killer calf strength and mental stamina. I became consumed by the visuals in the mirror, eyes watering as I questioned if my relev\\\\u00e9 was high enough, knee straight enough, pli\\\\u00e9 deep enough. Those tears didn\\'t actually fall until weeks later, with no Tchaikovsky\\'s Swan Lake to accompany the frustrations this time. I expressed to my ballet teacher that I was quitting ballet, my passion. Shocked, she pleaded me to try temporarily dancing once a week, but I refused. The decision was beyond my control. During my junior year, my doctor informed me I needed to put dancing on hold for the sake of my health, as I had been diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency. The most challenging part of the process wasn\\'t the discomfort of giving myself a daily shot, but having to slow down in what I thrived in giving my all. If I couldn\\'t spend as many hours dancing in the pursuit of perfecting my craft, then I felt I didn\\'t deserve to dance at all. Those weeks of not dancing felt uncomfortable and disorienting. I had to awkwardly respond to my friends\\' reactions to having quit an activity so integral to my identity. I convinced myself keeping busy would let me forget about dance, so I tried a gym membership, new school clubs, volunteering more, and adding more challenging academic classes. Yet, I still felt empty inside. Nothing could replace the satisfaction of hard work in the studio. Eventually, I figured it was time to see if, even at this slower pace, reintroducing dance into my life would make me feel myself again. Bringing back dance surprisingly made me feel more connected to myself. Prior to my break, I lost touch with the \\'performing arts\\' definition of dance, overly concerning myself with the visual. The stress of how I\\'d compare to others at that next performance, competition, or audition inhibited me from dancing for myself, having been so focused on perfecting what would be seen by the audience. Returning to dance, although it took until senior year to be full-time again, made me treasure how precious the gifts of movement and artistic expression are. My gratitude for the art form skyrocketed as I\\'m simply appreciative to have a body healthy enough to perform such anatomically-defying positions. Hearing Odette\\'s Act II Swan Lake variation no longer elicited pressure to have that perfect relev\\\\u00e9. I moved to a barre spot where I\\'m freed from the sight of a mirror, instead focused on translating such beautiful melodies into the character of a desperate, innocent swan. Stepping away from that reflection was invigorating. Focusing on the feelings, not appearances, of movement was meditative, making me feel more present and alive.Though I still have days of \\'blood, sweat, and tears,\\' these struggles motivate me to work harder, to cherish the pain of holding that leg up for one more second. The fulfillment produced from working to please myself, without being consumed with perfecting the end result, inspires me to take risks and try out new experiences. Such an experience includes celebrating Bathukamma with my Indian friend. I enjoyed the discomfort of being the only Latina in the Hindu celebration as I allowed myself to become engrossed in a vastly different culture. Another instance was volunteering as a contortionist at my school\\'s haunted house. While I may not have the stereotyped strong arms of a contortionist, I enjoyed exposing myself to a new art form with no pressure to be perfect.Realizing this power of working for myself through overcoming the obstacles of my diagnosis has allowed me to redefine my perception of success as far beyond the external image. Such an understanding will carry me forward in any field. \"}, {\"index\": 12, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Should I do a song, film, script, poem, story, drama, music video, magazine cover, or photo collage?

For the thousandth time this year, a student\\'s complaint about the apparent irrelevance of the day\\'s grammar lesson gave my teacher her cue to once again declare these words, which in turn only evoked more groans and grumbles from my classmates. Personally, by the 900th time that my teacher\\'s voice had carved that phrase into my mind, I had come to agree with its message-or so I thought. That word, \\'learn,\\' still prodded incessantly at my neurons like a restless toddler to its mother. But when I finally gave in to its relentless badgering, I was able to detect the inherent irony in that word when examined in the context of America\\'s public education system.For almost twelve years, public school has saturated my brain with gallons of information that have challenged me to think thoroughly about subjects like science and history and language, but these subjects are always separated into isolated spheres of existence. Throughout my educational career, teachers have turned their backs on valuable opportunities to identify multidisciplinary relationships, such as that between our history lesson on the development of the watermill in 19th century America and our physics lesson on the effect of hydropower on rotational motion. Like a zoo to its caged animals, the American public school system has trained us to compartmentalize not only our daily activities, but also our thought processes. For eight hours a day, five days a week, a bell dices the vast expanse of knowledge that the world holds in front of us into neat, 47 minute lectures, dictating when we study what and for how long we study it.We attend school almost every day, but we don\\'t truly learn anymore. When we were babies, our neurons were authorized to freely unite the logical left and creative right hemispheres of our minds. Interdisciplinarity in our youthful thoughts and fundamental lessons was expected; learning was not just easy, but it was celebrated. Every connection, every articulated thought, every discovery was an accomplishment. But the day we entered kindergarten was the day that cages were constructed and locked around our thoughts, significantly reducing our cognitive capabilities during the hours of 7:55 a.m. and 2:45 p.m.I want to learn again. I don\\'t just want to know why parentheses precede the period. Rather, I want to discuss the possible future of the English language by analyzing its transformation over time, because that kind of intellectual activity forces me to think about the past, present, and future forms of the world I live in. I don\\'t just want to memorize the world\\'s most fatal diseases, because I still won\\'t know how to use the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology as a possible tool to find their cures. Instead, I want to learn how concepts like music theory that do not traditionally exist in the medical field can be applied when detecting abnormalities in the human body, because that kind of knowledge both strengthens the ties between each half of my brain and better prepares me to serve as a member of the healthcare community in the future.America\\'s public education system currently isolates the academic disciplines, depriving students of a diverse, interconnected, relevant learning experience. As a result, the solution needed to save the next generation of fresh minds from the confines of stainless steel mental cages is to correct the curriculum. Correct the curriculum so students understand that education is a heterogeneous entity whose elements must interact freely for them to be most effectively applied post-graduation. Correct the curriculum so the abbreviated \\'Distance equals Rate times Time\\' formula-DRT-refers to a new method of academic exploration: Discuss, Research, Think. Correct the curriculum so we can do more than just learn for the sake of learning, but we can once again learn for the sake of intellectually developing.\"}, {\"index\": 15, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Altruistic to my core, I routinely create intricate desserts well past midnight for birthdays and holidays, or simply to extend kindness to others. I have earned the title of \\'mom\\' among my friends and teammates which humorously reveals the effect of my culinary gestures. Baking requires precision and is affected by many variables, any one of which can drastically alter its outcome. The recipe assumes a perfect environment; it fails if a single discrepancy occurs. Such is life. As a veritable perfectionist, I outlined my recipe for success freshman year and proceeded accordingly. But, the variables in my environment changed sophomore year as I experienced increased tension within my familial and scholastic spheres. The social aspect of school became an unhealthy situation marred by decisions of others with which I was not comfortable. Furthermore, my mother\\'s relationship with an abusive husband became increasingly violent and negatively affected my academic performance. While school empowered me with confidence and control, it now formed an origin of doubt and disarray. My recipe no longer applied, yet a resolve emerged out of the furnace, strengthened through tribulation. Adapt or fail: this was the dichotomy I faced. My mother raised me with undeniable strength as a single mother, cancer survivor, and sole provider. I, too, became a survivor, and I fought for the girl I used to be: focused, confident, self-assured. I urged my mom to separate from my stepfather, and she agreed, becoming the second divorce I have experienced firsthand. I knew I had to lead my family and myself out of the situation. Growth stems from self-awareness. Confronting my problems allowed me to resolve them. However, I also knew I could not rise to my potential if I remained in my current school environment because of its continued social pressures, and this realization brought additional growth. My circumstances were the catalyst for a new era. Instead of allowing adversity to limit my potential, I leveraged my trials into success. Despite having deep relationships with teachers and peers, high academic standing, and elected leadership roles, I trusted myself and transferred schools in the most pivotal of years. In my new school, my unwavering dedication led me to the top of my class, recipient of numerous awards, but most importantly, genuine happiness. I am still the girl who stays up until 2 a.m. baking for the person whose birthday would otherwise pass unnoticed. Through this tumultuous journey, I developed new strengths, character, and resolve. When I burned my first cake, I was faced with two options: quit or learn. When my life deviated from my recipe for success, I learned that I am not a product of my circumstances, but of my resultant choices. As I emerged from my proverbial oven, I found myself fortified with an inner strength that transcended anything I possessed previously. It empowered me to challenge perceived limitations and achieve my aspirations. Thus, the criterion with which I defined myself evolved, and I obtained resonance with my true character and self-identity. Today, I am capable of actually accomplishing my ambitions because of my past experiences. From standing up for myself and my family, to leaving an unhealthy environment, I removed the obstacles that limited my potential. I was then able to do the same in my community, my true passion; I developed two organizations that resolve separate problems: nonprofit photography and equitable career exploration. I identified areas that required solutions and used my abilities to achieve them. In my own life and the lives of others, I am proud of the change I have affected. Through these endeavors, I have focused on my passions for service and entrepreneurship and actively pursued the future I desire for myself. I am infinitely stronger today than I was two years ago, and I developed valuable traits of resilience and leadership that could have only been gleaned through adversity.\"}, {\"index\": 16, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I can tell when you wear lipstick, not because the color of your lips is any different (you despise gaudy colors), but because you smile wider.

Every year, I eagerly anticipated her visits to my family in America when she would weave tales of fetching water during neverending mosquito summers in her home country and making a living as a schoolteacher surrounded by sick children and three-legged dogs. Sitting in my air-conditioned and decidedly disease-free room, I felt very lucky. She sacrificed years of her life working so my parents could move to America and give me opportunities she never had. At age seven-and-a-half, I knew my grandmother was the person I admired more than anyone else in the world. Only a year later, that certainty shattered. My grandmother and I were walking home from the grocery store as indigo clouds crept across the setting orange sun. Suddenly, she tugged me by the arm. \\'What\\'s wrong?\\' I asked. Her eyes were narrowed at a man walking toward the bus stop behind us. Her pace quickened; I tripped trying to keep up. Once the man had passed, she told me in a matter-of-fact tone, \\'We do not talk to those people.\\' With a terrible shock, I realized my grandmother\\'s wariness was because the man was black. My tongue forgot itself, and I became sharply aware that the sky had gone dark. I was not ignorant of prejudice. I\\'d heard kids mock my friend for speaking Spanish with her father and endured strangers\\' slurs when I trick-or-treated in my neighborhood. I was inured to the world\\'s cruelty, but I\\'d always believed my family was a shelter from such hatred. From that day forward, however, I began to see stains of my grandmother\\'s prejudice in her everyday habits, gripping my attention and refusing to let go. I yearned to protest the little nods at intolerant politicians on the TV or her tensed expression when we walked into my primarily-black elementary school, but I couldn\\'t. I was the rope in a game of tug-of-war. On one side was justice, pulling with heels dug into the dirt. On the other side was my grandmother, someone I desperately wanted to forgive. How could I tug against her, the woman who had toiled for years to give me the privileged life I had? But what kind of person would I be if I let justice fall into the mud? Searching for answers, I scoured the stories she told me for the root of the problem. There, I found a woman who\\'d spent nearly her entire life in a country where she was never truly exposed to other races. When she first visited America, the stereotypes she learned were her sole informants on the unfamiliar people she encountered. I could never justify her behavior, but through her story, I began to understand why it existed.Years later, I found myself again in my room telling my grandmother about my closest friends, recounting everything from performing plays together to attending homecoming. When she asked, I described them to her, knowing most of them didn\\'t look like her and me. She said nothing, but something shifted in her eyes, indescribably softening her expression as she listened. In that moment, I knew telling those stories was a step in the right direction.To this day, whenever I see that look on someone else\\'s face, I know I\\'ve succeeded in upholding justice in my own way: by communicating. Be it through theater or writing or conversations, I constantly seek out opportunities to tell a story and hear those of other people. In stories I\\'ve discovered the power to plant empathy where there was once disregard, acceptance where there was once hatred, and compassion where there was once fear.Guiding everything I do is my quest to understand the world beyond how I alone perceive it and inspire others to do the same.My childhood best friend Jaylynn and I invented hundreds of stories about superheroes, ranging from Super-Sop, the giant sponge who epically absorbs oil spills in the oceans, to Handyman, the advice-giving hand-puppet who epically matches your shoes to your outfit. With imaginary capes trailing behind us, we re-enacted our stories on the playground, saving the world from mad scientists and crazed fashionistas. We were an inseparable duo and vowed to be the force of good no matter what evil we faced.One day, Jaylynn marched into the school cafeteria with a girl trailing behind her. \\'This is Kayla,\\' Jaylynn said brightly. \\'She\\'s new: she\\'s from Korea.\\' In a heavy accent, the girl mumbled, \\'Hello.\\' Before I could say a word back, she turned to Jaylynn and started speaking in Korean. Jaylynn cheerfully responded. I thought they would soon return to English, but instead their rapid-fire exchange of indecipherable syllables seemed to continue for hours. \\'What are you talking about?\\' I finally asked. Engrossed in conversation, they must not have heard me because neither acknowledged my question.Every day for the next few months, Kayla sat with us during lunch, and every day she spoke only to Jaylynn, almost always in Korean. It was as if she were purposely excluding me from their bubble: she never tried to talk to me, and moreover she prevented my best friend from talking to me. Although resentment burst in my chest whenever I saw her, I refrained from lashing out: I knew heroes never stooped to the villains\\' level.Just like in the stories, however, evil never vanishes without a fight.We were on the playground, and I heard Kayla call Jaylynn two words: best friend. Burning jealousy gripped my heart and refused to let go. I couldn\\'t take it anymore.\\'You\\'re wrong!\\' I screamed, anger swelling in my throat. \\'She\\'s MY best friend!\\'The cork had popped on my bottled emotions. I recounted how my every word to Kayla had fallen on deaf ears, how excluded and unwanted she made me feel.Finally, in her thick accent, she softly said, \\'I\\'m sorry.\\' My heart, previously boiling with rage, dropped ice-cold to my stomach. I recalled hearing that accent in class earlier in the year and seeing classmates tease her for it. I recalled how she slowly stopped talking to anyone besides Jaylynn. I had resented her for that, wishing she\\'d choose someone else. I realized, however, with a sharp pang that Jaylynn, the only other Korean kid in our school, was the only person with whom Kayla could speak in her native tongue, where she didn\\'t have to worry about navigating harsh English sounds.It struck me that I\\'d always played the hero on the playground because that\\'s who I thought I was: one of the good guys who saves the world. Looking at Kayla, I didn\\'t feel like a hero anymore. While I had been seething over the bubble she excluded me from, I hadn\\'t seen the wall I had drawn between us nor had I tried to look over to the other side. I had vilified someone who, like me, just wanted to feel accepted.My anger turned into shame and tears. All the apologies in the world didn\\'t feel like enough, and yet, Kayla forgave me. \\'We both made mistakes,\\' she said.In that moment, I found that the world is so much bigger than the tiny lens through which I view it. Whether I\\'m tackling an unfamiliar problem, debating an issue, or meeting someone new, I know now that nothing is as black-and-white as it may seem on the surface. I know that in a world where many talk, strength is found in being one of the few who listen, in putting myself into someone else\\'s shoes and learning from their experiences. After all, even superheroes cannot save the world if they are blind to the world beyond themselves.\\'Hello.\\' That was the first thing Kayla, a new student who had just moved from South Korea, ever said to me. In her thick accent, the two syllables in that simple word tumbled on her tongue like clothes in a washing machine. I became friends with Kayla. We liked the same books and bonded over the trials and tribulations of navigating fifth grade. Whenever she spoke, however, her voice seemed to swallow up her sentences so that you couldn\\'t help but hear her accent before you heard the words she was saying. In hushed giggles, I heard kids mock her when she answered questions in class. I couldn\\'t stand it.When I heard kids mocking Kayla\\'s accent, I implored them to stop and think about how hard it was to grasp a new language. I was greeted with countless rolled eyes and told constantly to \\'lighten up.\\' It made me angry. I was not angry at my peers, however. I was angry at the world. I was angry that I lived in a society that taught us from a young age that some voices are valuable and others are not. I couldn\\'t justify their teasing, but I understood why they did it. We are all products of our environment, and ours is one that hears ignorance in people whose tongues cannot pronounce the word \\'ignorance\\'.In a world where many talk, my greatest strength is being one of the few who listen. It\\'s this philosophy that drives me to constantly question what I think I know and seek out connections with the people around me, striving both to tell my stories and to learn from theirs, whether that be through school, art, speeches, or meeting new friends. I\\'ve learned that stories are not any more or less valuable based on whose voice they are told in. Only when we try to understand the human experience in its entirety, not just our own pieces of it, can we see that the world is so much bigger than the tiny lens through which we view it.\"}, {\"index\": 18, \"new_personal_statement\": \"My hours are varied, my schedule is nonexistent, and my wages depend entirely on the strength of my negotiating skills. Being a pianist is far from a typical summer job. Yet, to me, very few things in life compare with the bliss of sitting at my keyboard filling in a venue\\'s ambiance, playing soft melodies accompanied by clinking glasses and casual conversation.This bliss is the reason I lug around my keyboard, stand, and extension cord, complete with a chaotic array of sheet music, to and from events ranging from midday wedding receptions to gallery openings. Along with this collection of equipment, I also bring with me a quality that I value most: the ability to connect with my audience.When I arrived for my first Sunday night gig at the Old Sculpin Gallery, I positioned myself in the corner of the room and pulled out my sheet music as people filtered in. I stretched out my fingers and readjusted the creaky wooden chair beneath me. Then, I exhaled and lowered my trembling fingers to the keys of the starting notes, wincing at the occasional mistake.

When I was younger, my infatuation with music was limited to the rudimentary level of standing on my tiptoes to enthusiastically plunk random notes on the piano in my living room. With age, music has become increasingly fascinating to me because of its ability to affect how we feel while listening to it. Music brings us together as we bond over its raw, emotional power.

My job is to make at least one chord or phrase bring the audience closer to me and each other. This can be because a familiar tune evokes a favorite childhood memory, or because a piece I play allows them to see the image of a forlorn Argentinian maiden, a cascading waterfall, or the tumultuous love story that the artist was trying to convey.The music I play, while it isn\\'t virtuosic, is intrinsic to my understanding of the emotional impacts of the world\\'s most influential musicians.

Being a pianist is far from a typical summer job. Yet, to me, very few things in life compare with the bliss of sitting at my keyboard filling in a venue\\'s ambiance, playing soft melodies accompanied by clinking glasses and casual conversation.This bliss is the reason I lug around my keyboard, stand, and extension cord, complete with a chaotic array of sheet music, to and from events ranging from midday wedding receptions to gallery openings. Along with this collection of equipment, I also bring with me a quality that I value most: the ability to connect with my audience.When I arrived for my first Sunday night gig at the Old Sculpin Gallery, I positioned myself in the corner of the room and pulled out my sheet music as people filtered in. I stretched out my fingers and readjusted the creaky wooden chair beneath me. Then, I exhaled and lowered my trembling fingers to the keys of the starting notes, wincing at the occasional mistake. Soon, the music started to blend in with the room around me, and I eventually gained my confidence and rhythm.

Kids sat on floor mats or swayed to the heavy, hypnotic beat. I could not hear myself playing the cello over the uproar of the drums;nevertheless, a smile crept across my face. As I shredded away, I lost myself in the tones and harmonies. I felt on the edge, walking a tightrope of creation.My band, SoundCheck, was performing songs about social justice issues like misogyny and immigration, attempting to teach mostly elementary and middle school students about the importance of respecting and loving others. We also led songwriting and activism workshops at schools, rallies, and conferences. My ten band members were students from across Vermont who came fromdiverse social and musical backgrounds, influencing our genre-defying originals. I auditioned for the band in my sophomore year, hoping to expand beyond my background as a classical musician.If I threw myself fully into the music\\\\u2014brow furrowed, head bobbing, feet stomping\\\\u2014the audience responded. If I stayed on safe ground, they did too, creating a chasm of understanding between us. Staying in touch with my emotions helped me better observe how they ebbed and flowed throughoutour performance. I had come to depend on our band rehearsals and performances to help me fine-tune my emotional awareness as I learned to not only communicate emotion to our audiences but also attend to the emotions of others in my daily life.But as we struck the final note of our song and the kids erupted in cheers and applause, a worrying thought materialized, one that I carried around whenever we performed: what if our audience didn\\'t get it? Most of our lyrics were easy enough to understand, and I even exaggerated the way I swayed to the music and smiled or frowned as the lyrics and melody required. Despite my band\\'s efforts to manipulate music to craft our message, I worried that students could still view our performance as a superficial experience. I wondered if music could ever be a meaningful way to communicate concrete ideas about the importance of respect and love.As we transitioned to the workshop, where we conducted a songwriting exercise by asking different groups to write song verses from the perspective of the oppressor, oppressed, and bystander, I asked a fourth-grader to share his thoughts on the exercise. He responded, \\'I think this is helpful because I can understand others and what they\\'re going through.\\'\\'Yes! But why is that important?\\' I pressed.He paused for a second, and in that moment I could sense his empathy and discovery of purpose. \\'We need compassion to help solve our problems together. That\\'s what makes me want to help out a classmate who gets pushed on the playground, even if he\\'s not my friend.\\'His response revealed why I felt these songs\\\\u2014and our social justice work\\\\u2014on such an emotional level. In his simple response about the importance of compassion, I felt that chasm of understanding closing, instead of widening, between my band and our audience. Feeling is intimately tied to social justice, and the student showed that discrimination affects people not just economically and socially, but emotionally. I hoped our songs could serve as a reminder of this greater emotional understanding, which might lead to a lasting engagement with social justice beyond SoundCheck.A few weeks later, we took the stage of a local middle school. I was ready to walk the creative tightrope once again. In tune with my bandmates, I played with tenderness and sensitivity during an improvised solo and worked hard during the workshop to make personal connections with students. Through playing music, teaching Fall 2020 9 FYEA songwriting, and engaging with others on social justice issues, I have become more in tune with my own emotions and those of others, practicingand inspiring empathy and action along the way.\"}, {\"index\": 20, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I had spent hours strolling on the narrow bridge, watching the pearl-white water lilies gracefully floating in Monet\\'s pond. Swimming in the uncharted depths of the ocean, I would slip through coral caverns, passing rocky walls festooned with delicate anemones. Each puzzle I finished felt like a magic carpet, hauling me away from the normalcy of my bedroom.Border pieces had to be joined. Pieces had to be grouped. I soaked in the colors, patterns, textures, trying to establish connections. Apart from occasional moments of frustration when my stubbornness kicked in trying to force pieces into places they could never fit, the process was peaceful. Growing older, I challenged myself with ever more sophisticated puzzles. Pieces looked impossibly similar. At the same time, each was maddeningly unique. I had to refine my tactics to turn the daunting chaos into harmonious order. Order appeared in separate areas, evolved independently around seed pieces, growing, region by region.Gradually, I came to view my life through jigsaw-shaped spectacles: every aspect is an oddly-shaped piece which fits into the puzzle that is my life. Some pieces seem to have sprung out of nowhere: my talents, my inherent passions. They grow into regions, each at its own pace. Each region calls for a tailored strategy. However, I no longer begin with border pieces. I have cast them away to reach the unexplored.It was with this boldness that I thrust myself into the endless world of mathematics. I sought adventure in primes and irrationals, in the harmony of forms, the geometric elegance. Since the early years of elementary school, I have tried my hand at several competitions. As a solo puzzler or collaborative solver on the national mathematics team, I felt the thrill as my mind overcame barriers to navigate the winding paths of mathematics. It is the same chord of satisfaction that resonates inside me as I pop an elusive puzzle piece in place.Pieces packed with the slideshows of my dad\\'s distant backpacking travels, carefree conversations with my friends on summer nights, invigorating moments panting with my mom through the Athens mini-marathon, all are tightly woven through time to create my own magic carpet. Edges have long faded. Pieces have fused together. It is from this mesh of ideas, memories, interests, quirks that immense power flows.There are pieces of unmatched strength. Those do not only belong to my personal puzzle. Instead, I share them with others: my family, my friends, people in my country, people all over the world. Each piece we place represents a small triumph, a hint at the ultimate satisfaction of completing our joint puzzle. We work together, exchanging advice, circulating ideas. These exchanges between people who see the world differently breed challenge, and challenge breeds change.Meeting with Syrian refugees in Greece through the online platform I created opened up a new world. I shared with them stories from my school days. They shared their hope of one day going to college. I recounted my grandfather\\'s harrowing escape into refugeehood in 1922 when his hometown of Smyrna was ruthlessly purged. They recounted their own chronicles of heartbreak, following a similar route away from their bombed homes, through fear and sagging tents, to Athens. Together, we paint the puzzle pieces in bold colors. We shape their elaborate edges. As they all intertwine, shapes start to emerge and the picture comes alive.There are no border pieces to my life\\'s puzzle. There is no picture on the outside of the box revealing what the puzzle will eventually look like or how many pieces it will have. As I intricately carve the pieces\\' undefined edges, each finds its seamlessly-interlocking match. Regions are growing around seeds of intuition and curiosity, waiting to be connected over shared ideas, dreams, experiences. My puzzle is a magic carpet that I steer into uncharted territories. Led by my aspirations, I determine the journey along the way.\"}, {\"index\": 21, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I can tell when you wear lipstick, not because the color of your lips is any different (you despise gaudy colors), but because you smile wider.

At what point should she jump? This is what I contemplated at age eight, late at night, curled up in my bed reading math textbooks written by my grandma, who had developed a high school math curriculum designed to teach math through its real-life applications. At the time, I didn\\'t understand the math, but I loved the idea that math could be used to solve real world problems. In second grade, I also discovered how important math was to the sport I loved, baseball. My dad taught me about batting averages and how teams use statistics to make important decisions about strategy. My two primary areas of academic interest are math and public policy.

I am intrigued by the factors that can lead to the success or failure of one policy approach over another, and the impact those successes or failures can have on different communities. My interest in policy deepened through my internship with the City Council and my work on the Youth Commission. I walk by homeless encampments on my way to school, a stark reminder of my city\\'s growing homelessness crisis. Housing is the focus of the Youth Commission, which is advocating for another youth shelter. The debates about housing are impassioned and emotional, but there are no simple solutions. Most exciting to me is the use of economic theory, statistics, and data to solve complicated societal problems. Our first step in advancing the new youth shelter, for example, is to collect comprehensive data on homeless youth to show the need for a shelter and its viability. I am inspired to use my love for math and statistics not just to figure out the right time to dive off a ferris wheel but to help solve pressing problems in my community. On my first day of kindergarten, I didn\\'t understand a word my teacher said. Six months earlier, I had won the lottery when my name was randomly picked for enrollment in my school district\\'s Spanish-immersion program. My parents seemed thrilled, but on the first day, I didn\\'t feel very lucky. The program consists of an equal number of native English and native Spanish speaking students. Elementary school was taught mostly in Spanish. The program continued in middle school, where I took history and language in Spanish. In high school, I took Spanish for native speakers and two AP Spanish courses.After that intimidating first day of kindergarten, I soon understood everything my teacher said. By the time I finished elementary school, I could speak, read, and write fluently in Spanish. In AP Spanish Literature, I read poetry, 14th century novels, and historical documents such as Hern\\\\u00e0n Cort\\\\u00e9s\\' 16th century letter to the King of Spain - all in its original language. My second language provides me entry into another world of art, literature, and history. I can directly speak and communicate with millions more people in the world in their native language, and I have already put my language skills to use. For example, many of the students in the fifth grade mock trial class I help teach come from Spanish-speaking homes. I have translated all the course materials into Spanish for them, so their parents can help them with their homework just as easily as the English-speaking parents can. Last year, my family visited the Mesoamerican ruins of Teotihuac\\\\u00e0n. No English-speaking tour guides were available, so I translated the three-hour tour for my family and other tourists. My favorite part of the experience was chatting with the tour guide, who was studying English, about the challenges and rewards of learning a second language. I now feel lucky. The Spanish-immersion program was a gift that has enhanced my education and my life. \\'So what do you want to see changed at our school?\\' It was sophomore year and I was brainstorming with my running mate for Junior Class President. One thing came to mind immediately. We needed free menstrual products in school bathrooms. It had bothered me since middle school that toilet paper and soap were considered necessities but menstrual products were not, causing some girls to face embarrassment or miss school if they were caught unexpectedly without supplies or couldn\\'t afford them in the first place. I had read an article about New York City requiring free menstrual products in schools and I decided my school should as well. I won the election and immediately set up a meeting with my principal. Before the meeting, I prepared fact sheets about the New York policy and researched cost estimates. She agreed to install dispensers in six of the school bathrooms. When I first saw a machine filled with free menstrual products, I felt empowered. But I wanted free menstrual products in bathrooms district-wide. I advocated with the middle school principals, conducted a district wide fiscal analysis, and published an Op-Ed in the local paper to present my argument publicly. I then drafted a School Board policy, which I presented to the school district policy committee. My policy then went to the full board, where it passed unanimously. I then wrote an Op-Ed in The Sacramento Bee explaining the need for the policy throughout California. I am helping a student, who read my Op-Ed and contacted me through Instagram, to advocate for the policy in her district in San Jose. I wrote letters to my state legislators and this fall I went to Sacramento as part of a leadership conference and presented my menstrual products policy proposal to legislative staff. I am inspired by the willingness of my school district to adopt a new policy and I will keep advocating for state lawmakers to change state law. If and when they do, then I will turn to other policy ideas I have to better the lives of people in my community.When I told my dad I was going to write one of my essays about my artwork, he said, \\'What artwork?\\' I guess I shouldn\\'t be surprised. A lot of what I do in high school is public-facing: running for student body president, advocating for policy changes, writing for the school newspaper. Artwork is something I do for myself.The first piece of art I made that I was proud of still hangs in my room today. I made it the summer before first grade, at an art camp. It is a drawing of a bird, done with red and black sharpie, with tiny geometric patterns inside of it. I added clouds and then finished it off with blue and orange watercolor spread across the whole piece. I still remember how much I enjoyed making it. When I worked on it, I could focus on nothing else. It was around this time that I began to appreciate looking at art. One day, my grandma took me to an art museum, where I saw the painting Woman with a Hat, by Henri Matisse. It was a simple portrait of a woman wearing a hat, but the colors were bright and all over the place. Her nose was yellow, her ears were orange, and her forehead was blue. It fascinated me so much that I got a print and hung it in my room. At a young age, I realized that art is an escape for me. When I make it, or look at it, I am not distracted by anything. Art is different from my day to day responsibilities at school. Sometimes it\\'s just flowers drawn with colored pencils in the margins of my planner and sometimes it\\'s an acrylic painting on an eight by ten canvas. Sometimes it\\'s watercolor and sometimes it\\'s oil pastel. I\\'ve also really enjoyed learning about art in my AP Art History class this year. No matter what it is, it\\'s different from my everyday life and uses a different part of my brain, which is what makes it so important to me. I am an analytical, numbers person, but I also like the creative, artistic part of my life. Last year, I ran for student body president. The election kicked off with a candidate meeting in a stuffy, overflowing classroom. Seventy candidates were vying for ten positions; six were running for president. I knew, of course, that I might not win. But I had no idea that this election would end in one of the biggest cases of election fraud in high school history. I ran for president because, in my experience, student leaders can make meaningful change. As a junior, I led a campaign to require free menstrual products in school bathrooms. It had long bothered me that toilet paper and soap were considered necessities but menstrual products were not, causing some girls to face embarrassment or miss school. Through my advocacy, and the cooperation of my principal, I convinced the School Board to require free menstrual products throughout the district. My campaign for president focused on expanding the menstrual products policy, gathering more student input on school events and issues, and building school community across different groups of students.In the ensuing months, when I wasn\\'t doing homework or studying for the SAT, I was campaigning. I made several posters: one listing my goals, another with my picture and logo, and one with a newspaper clipping describing my role in bringing free menstrual products to Berkeley High. I organized twenty classroom visits, where I presented my ideas and answered questions. Each lunch period, I roamed the campus, introducing myself to as many of my 3,000 classmates as I could. During those months, there was always one pesky question at the back of my mind: what if I lose? I shoved that thought aside and campaigned harder.At the end of a week of online voting, the election commissioner announced a candidate meeting. I was away, on a band trip in Los Angeles. Setting down my bass clarinet, I slipped out of rehearsal and sat outside on the curb with my phone pressed to my ear and my heart racing. I assumed we were about to hear the election results. Instead, over the sound of the passing traffic, I was just barely able to hear the commissioner say, \\'I have discovered a major case of election fraud.\\' My hand started shaking. I listened in stunned silence as he explained that one of my fellow candidates for president had obtained a list of student ID numbers, signed into 500 students\\' email accounts, and voted for himself hundreds of times. That candidate was disqualified, and the students whose votes were stolen were given additional time to vote. The call ended and I couldn\\'t move. One of my friends came out from the rehearsal to check on me. \\'Are you okay?\\' she asked. I guess I looked a little distraught.\\'No.\\'The commissioner published a detailed report on the fraud. Local newspapers picked up the story, and the national media, including The New York Times, followed. When the media attention died down and the extended voting concluded, the official results arrived: I came in second. I was disappointed, but glad I had tried. Despite my defeat, I am still working on my campaign promises. I accepted a position as student representative on the committee that allocates school district funding. I published an Op-Ed in The Sacramento Bee advocating for menstrual products in school bathrooms statewide, and recently I went to Sacramento to present the policy to legislative staff. I am also helping students in San Jose, Stockton, and San Diego to implement similar policies in their districts.And I have added a new issue to my platform: fair elections. The City Council adopted a proposal that I, through my internship at the Council, proposed and drafted that allows city employees to take Election Day off. Now, I\\'m turning my attention to pre-registering as many of my classmates as I can so that they are ready to cast their votes.I ripped apart the seam of the teddy bear\\'s stomach and reached in. Deep in the fluff I rooted around and pulled out the hidden Snickers bar. Confiscating contraband candy snuck in through the mail was part of my office job at the sleepaway camp on Orcas Island where I had lived for a month each summer since I was ten. My other jobs were sorting mail, stuffing envelopes, flattening cardboard, stamping letters, and talking with prospective campers. Fellow staff members who worked in the barn or garden felt sorry for me, not shy about their opinion that I had gotten stuck with the worst job. But the truth is, I loved working in the office. I thrive on organization, systems, and processes - not to mention I got to eat the seized candy. My enthusiasm for the camp office and its glorious systems is grounded in my deeper love for using numbers and logic to solve problems. Even at age eight, late at night, I would curl up in my bed reading math textbooks written by my grandmother (who had developed a high school math curriculum designed to teach math through its real-life applications). My grandma\\'s textbooks asked questions like, at what point should a diver jump if she is standing on a moving ferris wheel and wants to land in a cart of water that is travelling back and forth below? At the time, I didn\\'t understand the math, but I loved the idea that math could be used to solve complicated problems. In second grade, I also discovered how important math was to the sport I loved, baseball. My dad taught me about batting averages and how teams use statistics to make important decisions about strategy. My two primary areas of academic interest are math and public policy, and my desire to study economics stems from a combination of those interests. I discovered my interest in math through my dad and my grandma. My interest in policy came later, through classes that exposed me to social sciences and comparative governmental systems. I am intrigued by the factors that can lead to the success or failure of one policy approach over another, and the impact those successes or failures can have on different communities. My interest in policy only deepened when I began working as an intern at the City Council and as an appointed member of the City\\'s Youth Commission.

Recently, I spoke at a School Board meeting and a City Council meeting to advocate for accurate data collection on homeless youth and the allocation of more funding to support homeless families.There is no shortage of problems facing my generation. It can feel overwhelming. So far, I have tried to focus on what I can do as a member of my community, whether it is increasing access to menstrual products for girls at my school, or proposing legislation at the City Council (which was ultimately adopted) to give city employees Election Day off work. I chose to work in the office at camp because that is where the decisions get made, where the policies are developed, where the systems are created. That\\'s where I want to be.I am persistent, and my friends and family would probably describe me as someone who isn\\'t afraid to stand up for what she believes in. If I\\'m being honest, they would also probably say that I can obsess over things that I think need to change, especially if I feel like I can do something about it. But I am proud of the change I\\'ve accomplished. For example, last year I read an article about New York City requiring free menstrual products in schools for students who need them unexpectedly or can not afford them. To me, this seemed like an issue of equal access to education for girls. I decided Berkeley High needed this policy too. This was a concrete, tangible goal, but I needed to figure out how to achieve it. I prepared fact sheets and cost estimates and met with my principal, who agreed to install dispensers in six of the school bathrooms on a pilot basis. Armed with the results of the successful pilot, I drafted a district-wide policy, which the school board adopted. Getting the school board to approve my policy wasn\\'t easy, but with persistence and resourcefulness, I got it done. I am now advocating for the policy statewide. I wrote letters to my legislators and met with legislative staff in Sacramento, and I have connected with student leaders in other districts. My friends sometimes ask me what I am going to tackle next. I\\'m excited to get to UBC and find out. A diver is standing on a moving ferris wheel and wants to land in a cart of water that is moving back and forth below. At what point should she jump?

Sometimes, my mom concocted halfhearted answers, and other times, probably wondering why the dependable advice of reading to your child before bedtime wasn\\'t working, she would tell me to write my own ending. And so I did. Armed with construction paper, glitter glue, and Crayola markers, I created fantastical sequels to the stories that most intrigued me.Writing my own endings evolved into sneaking chapter books under my desk in elementary school. One of the under-the-table books I read was Marie in the Shadow of the Lion , a novella about twelve and thirteen year olds ensnared in civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The atrocities the child soldiers had to endure and the disconcerting ending of the book diverged sharply from the tidy resolutions of the books I normally read. It also prompted my first foray into advocacy. I talked about this book to anyone who would listen? my friends, my parents, and my teacher, who ended up assigning excerpts to the class and arranging a Skype call with the book?s author. Energized, I researched this issue, learning the US was one of only two countries worldwide that had not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, an international agreement establishing liberties for children. I organized classmates to write a letter to the President and created an online petition, and while we never received a response from the White House and our petition remains in the dusty archives of Change.org, my desire to devise my own endings didn?t end there.By the time I was in high school, sneaking under-the-table books grew into spending lazy weekend mornings engrossed in the New Yorker . In February of this past year, a photo in the magazine caught my eye: teenagers making phone calls on the floor surrounded by bottles of Gatorade, laptops, and notepads. They were students at Stoneman Douglas High School, and they were orchestrating a national movement from someone?s living room. In their focused eyes, I saw the possibility that this particular story didn?t have to end with cynicism and despair regarding our future; that it might continue in a direction yet unknown. Soon after, I found myself in a church basement in southwest Detroit, listening to high school students share their experiences with gun violence as well as racial profiling. These weekly meetings led to a student-run March for Our Lives Detroit, which I helped organize. The materials I used this time weren?t too different from those of my previous literary efforts. But instead of Crayola markers and construction paper, my tools were Sharpie markers, posterboards, and legal pads on which I scribbled interview notes and speaker schedules. And this time, I felt like I?d done more than make up an ending to a story I?d just read. As I walked and chanted with over nine thousand participants, I felt as though I was part of a larger, unbridled movement, a new story that was just beginning.My follow-up questions have grown in intricacy since my preschool days. Why are communities of color affected by environmental degradation to a greater extent? How does governmental instability impact food security? My attempts to answer these questions have propelled me to embark on unfamiliar journeys and become involved in movements with impacts larger than I could have ever imagined. In inviting me to write my own endings, my mother gave me an enormous gift: the confidence to know that I could shape outcomes and the pragmatism to create tangible solutions. I hope my future sequels will be written not in Crayola marker and glitter glue, but in print, as policy-based solutions to global challenges.\"}, {\"index\": 24, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Rebuilding your entire life\\'s work in one afternoon is a pretty daunting task. That\\'s what I attempted a few Sundaysago, my life\\'s work being the glorious, 151-track opera playlist I spent years cultivating, accidentally deleted with afew careless taps on a phone. Eventually, through sheer force of will and hours of tedium, I recreated a playlist of118 songs. Maybe I\\'ll remember some of those missing 33 eventually, but the rest is lost to me forever.That\\'s okay, though. I\\'m losing the music I love all the time. The first time I saw Bizet\\'s Carmen, its exhilarating,cathartic beauty crept into every part of my life. Seven-year-old me played Carmen on CD ceaselessly until I\\'dmemorized every note. Even after ten years of delving recklessly into the opera world, nothing else is as ingrainedin my mind, heart, and soul. Still though, Carmen\\'s only one opera, and the more I memorize it, the more I lose thewonder I felt when I was young and it was new. The days when the intertwining melodies of the Act I duet and thetragedy of Carmen\\'s murder against the thrilling splendor of the bullfight were all I ever thought about. I will neveragain experience Carmen\\'s thrill the same way I once did.There was a time when opera was an electrifying art form just dawning on the world. I\\'ve always wondered what itwas like when operas were the blockbusters that people flocked to theaters to see. I\\'d like to think I would\\'verecognized Bizet\\'s genius even then. But he was doomed to an early death, Carmen being the last mark he evermade on the music world. Everything he ever wrote and ever will write exists already. Eventually I\\'ll get through allof his music, and all of Verdi\\'s and Puccini\\'s and Mozart\\'s, and someday there won\\'t be any left to discover.Sometimes I feel like the music I love so much is slowly letting out its dying breath, like time has already run outand I\\'m delusionally grasping onto something that\\'s no longer there.Maybe my playlist will never be as perfect as it once was. And maybe nothing as deliriously perfect to me asCarmen will ever be written again, and I\\'ll spend my lifetime chasing it in vain. But I\\'ve learned to live with that.Carmen\\'s novelty is lost to me forever, but the way my heart soars along with the music even now is no differentfrom ten years ago, or from Carmen\\'s first audience in 1875. That audience, the singers, and Bizet are long gone,but Carmen\\'s reckless spirit lives on, resurrected in each performance. It\\'s comforting to know I\\'m connected to allthose people by at least one beautiful thing.Even if opera is slowly fading, losing its hold on the world, every performance is still as alive as the singersperforming, musicians playing, composers writing. As alive as the scandal, rebellion, and shattered boundariesthat fill operas like Carmen to the brim. As alive as me, breath rising and falling with the crescendoes of the music,crying with the characters\\' heartbreaks, eyes closed, heart singing with the melody. In the end, that makes it allworth it. I\\'ve lost a playlist I spent years perfecting. I\\'m getting farther away from my favorite music with eachpassing year.

Opera lets me experience entire worlds of music, characters, and emotion created hundreds of yearsago but brought to new life every day. In ten short years, I have lived thousands of full, beautiful, unique lives. Marching band is all about conformity. For eight minutes, 120 of us have to look and sound identical, not a step or note out of place. But if conforming to the standards of marching and music is hard enough, conforming socially is another story. Anytime I saw one of my quiet saxophone freshmen feeling overwhelmed by the sheer vivaciousness of the biggest, loudest section in the band, I thought back to three years ago, when I thought I would never become a true part of the section without changing my entire personality. It was the section leaders who helped me transform the section in my eyes from a group of loud upperclassmen who always talked over me into a family that loved and accepted me despite differing personalities. As a section leader, my most important job, more than teaching people marching and playing, was teaching people to feel welcome. Each year, I watched out for the new members, tried to include them in my conversations and lunch groups, because I knew that even simple kindnesses matter when you feel invisible. At the section bonfire I hosted, the new members got \\'initiated\\' by completing silly tasks like smashing a raw egg on their forehead and we all gathered around to play the flashlight game, a tradition that\\'s been passed through the section for years, and by the end of the night I would see the joy on their faces in becoming a real part of something bigger than themselves. I watched bonds start to form between the most unlikely of people, as the older, louder members start to realize what I\\'d known all along: that those quiet freshmen are actually funny, dynamic, interesting, incredible people worth knowing. Last month, at my last evening rehearsal, the staff left the field and we had one performance just for ourselves, eight final minutes for seniors to relish the four years we spent doing what we love with the people we can\\'t live without.

Opera lets me experience entire worlds, characters, music, and emotion created hundreds of years ago but brought to new life every day. In ten years, I have lived thousands of full, beautiful, unique lives. Last spring, I had to read easily the most personal thing I\\'d ever written out loud to 54 people. My poem was about my mother\\'s upbringing in poverty in China, worked her way to the best university in Beijing, full of hope for her future, only to see from the front lines the hope of her country\\'s future and her classmates\\' lives shattered at Tiananmen. Public speaking had always been something I\\'d struggled with. How could I possibly share such an intimate part of my family\\'s history to dozens of people, some of whom I barely knew? When the day arrived, I told myself that I would just go up there, shut my brain off for a few minutes, emotionally detach myself from the thing that I had poured so much of my heart into, and sit back down. I told myself that was the only way I would make it. That is not what happened.The first half of my reading was fine. In fact, the nerves I had been fighting almost seemed to dissipate a little. Then, I suddenly realized there were tears streaming down my face, and it was over for me. I started crying uncontrollably, tried desperately to regain my composure and finish, but I couldn\\'t do it. It seemed, in the moment, as if my worst nightmare had come true.I realized later that the reason I was crying had nothing to do with my anxiety about presenting. I\\'d cried because of the poem itself and what it meant to me. In reacting the way I did, I hadn\\'t failed to speak publicly at all. I had succeeded in all the ways that were important: conveying the destruction of Tiananmen, the emotional impact that it had on me and my family and thousands of others better than words ever could. There was pride to be felt in my vulnerability Even though public speaking may not be the easiest thing for me to do, this incident demonstrated to me that I could do it when it mattered, when I had something important to tell people.On our last night at YYGS, the six of us sat overlooking the dining hall and played one last game of cards with the deck I\\'d had them all sign. Logan was terrible and Hazuki won with her quiet, unassuming cleverness, as usual. Then we sat quietly until midnight, soaking in each other\\'s company, turning our memories of the two deliriously fantastic over in our heads so they would stay there and new forever. Early the next morning, we had one last group hug, with no words spoken, and that was it. I dragged my suitcase, alone, out the gates, down five blocks to the Greyhound station, Missouri-bound. They left, too, for LA, Irvine, Seattle, Auckland, and Osaka.We\\'ll never play cards together again. Making friends isn\\'t my strongest suit, and I have never formed such strong bonds with anyone that fast, only to be torn apart by distance so suddenly.That last night, we recorded goodbye videos for each other. I still can\\'t bring myself to watch mine. Not after marching band just ended, when I have mere months left with Anushka, my best friend since kindergarten. But I still have that deck of cards, signed with inside jokes: God has cursed Zack\\'s eyes, Kavya doesn\\'t understand bookstores, Diya doesn\\'t know what a cube is. Izzi\\'s a Scientologist. I don\\'t like goodbyes, but life is full of them, and these are the memories that make them worth it.I don\\'t know for sure where I\\'m going to end up in life. Maybe I\\'ll change the world someday, and maybe I will change one person\\'s life, but that would be enough for me. The weight of a person\\'s impact can be measured a lot of ways--in medals earned, inventions created, or lives saved, but also in how much it hurts to say goodbye. Knowing that, in two short weeks I was able to have some kind of impact on five people I\\'d never before and might never see again, and knowing that they had the same impact on me, gives me hope for all of our futures.MIT ESSAYSPlease tell us more about your cultural background and identity in the space below (100 word limit).My last name, Trindade, means \\'Trinity\\' in Portuguese.

One person stands in the middle of the circle, looks straight up at the stars, spins as fast as they can, and try not to fall (they always do) as someone shines a flashlight into their eyes. As section leader, it was my job to help people feel welcome in the group. I watched out for freshmen overwhelmed by the vivaciousness of the biggest, loudest section, in the same position I was three years ago. I included them in my conversations and lunch groups, because simple kindnesses matter when you feel invisible. Eventually, I\\'d see joy on their faces in becoming part of something bigger than themselves, as older, louder members started to realize that those quiet freshmen were funny, dynamic, interesting people worth knowing.Before competitions, we\\'d have section breakfast, laughing with more energy than we had any right to at that hour, fueled by each others\\' company. Before we performed, there\\'d be a moment of bated breaths, stadium lights beaming against a black sky, the world outside of the field ceasing to exist. At that moment I always knew that I was exactly where I needed to be. Finally, on a November evening in my backyard, we gathered around to play the flashlight game, and I marvelled at how, for a few minutes, we were each willing to lose complete control and trusted each other to catch us when we fell.Describe the world you come from; for example, your family, clubs, school, community, city, or town. How has that world shaped your dreams and aspirations? (200-250 words)When I moved to Columbia in 2005, my neighborhood was nearly surrounded by forest, with a little gravel path marching bravely into the dense woods. In my mind, it\\'s beautiful. In winter, snow cloaks the branches and blankets the ground, muffling the world, and it\\'s hard to imagine the sun exists for any reason other than reflecting off the snow, bathing the trees with the warm white light of heaven. At night, shadowy silhouettes of branches twist toward the sky, reaching for the glow of the stars. When I was younger, I never saw that. I passed those woods every day and never thought to venture down that gravel path and uncover the wonders within.This town is changing, fast. One evening last December I was driving home while listening to Vivaldi\\'s Winter, celebrating almost-fresh snow. On a whim, I drove past my neighborhood, down the new road that had smothered the gravel path. Shiny houses stood in place of gentle armies of white-cloaked skeleton trees. Where the pavement ended, I parked my car and stepped out. The ground sloped down into a spotless white clearing, and beyond that, a snow-dusted forest stretched toward the setting sun. The woods behind me were gone, replaced by suburbia and the fresh regret of losing something I didn\\'t realize I had. But now, the bright, shivering notes of Winter played in one ear, and as the sky darkened, shadowy branches twisted up into the night, still reaching for the glow of the stars.Tell us about the most significant challenge you\\'ve faced or something important that didn\\'t go according to plan.

(QB)I could ramble endlessly about the fascinating complexity of science, the expressive timbre of classical music, or the gut-wrenching scenes in each episode of Grey\\'s Anatomy\\\\u2014but when it comes to politics, words that normally spill from my lips with ease come to a complete halt and my thrill for discussion diminishes.Politics is a matter I have persistently avoided, fearing that conflicting opinions will ignite a cascade of turmoil. In past experiences, the discussion of politics has always led to the firing of aggressive rhetoric as each opposing viewpoint battles for dominance. Amid the rising political polarization in the United States, discussing politics in a civilized manner seemed to be a rare feat.It wasn\\'t until the summer before my senior year of high school that my entire perspective on politics changed. I had the opportunity to attend Palmetto Girls State, a government-in-action program which stressed the importance of active participation in U.S. politics. As a delegate, I campaigned for offices, elected officials, and legislated policies for our government. During the process of making bills, a different side of political discussion was revealed to me. Standing in the massive legislative chambers of the South Carolina State House, I was surrounded by hundreds of fellow delegates and completely immersed in their diversity of virtues. The blue hues of my liberal, democratic ideologies juxtaposed starkly with the red tints of my peers\\' conservative, republican ideals. Surprisingly, it was the discussion of our differences that allowed us to successfully complete the task in front of us: draft a bill to pass into legislation. We quickly agreed to a bill that would address the flaws in the current education system; however, deciding what specific approach to use was not as simple.\\'Perhaps we should reinforce a standardized system which assesses concrete skills to measure progress?\\' suggested one delegate.I disagreed. But instead of erupting into a bitter quarrel, I explained my position and the others listened with sincerity.\\'I believe standardized assessments fail to address the unique attributes of each student. What if we instituted a Montessori structure, an approach where skills are measured by self-directed learning?\\' Though our approaches in drafting our education bill varied, we had one commonality that united us: the desire to make an impact. But in order to be do so, we first had to compromise. Without haste, we analyzed the practicalities of our propositions and found that the best solution was to combine them. Our bill incorporated both standardized tests so that performance could be measured from a large-scale and elements from the Montessori approach in order to foster creativity and independent learning.Palmetto Girls State taught me that when diverging ideas and perspectives merge into one, the results can be astounding. Since this experience, I have applied my new outlook on politics to every encounter with one who does not share my beliefs. Instead of simply pushing my own virtues forward, I listen earnestly to the contrasting opinions of my peers and strive to establish common-ground.

The grandma I once knew had a loving gaze, one that beamed of light the day I learned how to ride a bike and one that surveilled protectively behind the screen door as I begged to take the training wheels off. But standing in room 216 of the Lexington Medical Center Alzheimer\\'s ward, I felt like an unwelcome stranger.She no longer met me with her tight, overwhelming embrace\\\\u2014the kind of hug that would leave me gasping for air as she squeezed out every ounce of worry and replaced it with warmth. Instead, my arms opened only to be met with a rageful, \\'Get away from me! Who are you?\\' The force of those words reverberated throughout my body, as though they were physical blows. I was struck by the painful reminder that Alzheimer\\'s Disease held my grandmother captive and had taken away the one person I loved most.Where there were supposed to be firing bundles of neurons, was a grey mush of tangled fibers and clumped proteins. What was meant to be home to heartfelt memories, was now a blank void bereft of all the grand adventures we shared. Instinctively, I found solace in seeking understanding. The sluggish yet faithful Dell desktop in my school\\'s computer lab quickly became my refuge, the world-wide-web my home. I dove headfirst into every search engine I could think of, thirsting for knowledge and craving for answers to my extensive list of \\'whys\\', \\'whats\\', and \\'hows\\'. Why couldn\\'t my grandma remember our Sunday morning tradition of binging Judge Judy before heading to church? According to WebMD, it was because her neural pathways were blocked by Amyloid plaques, aggregates of proteins preventing signals from reaching areas of the brain responsible for cognition. What could I do to make her less angry when I approach her? Various caregiver forums taught me that the best way to relieve her frustration was through distraction. So every subsequent visit, I walked into room 216, boombox in hand, and we bonded through the vibrations of \\'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\', just like the old days. How could I prevent Alzheimer\\'s Disease from shattering the dynamics of other families? Despite my vigorous searches, I could not find the answer to this question on Google, or Yahoo Answers, or Bing. In fact, the only result my search rendered was: \\'It is impossible to predict or prevent the progression of the disease\\'\\\\u2014but I do not believe in \\'impossibility\\'. The countless hours I spent delving into the realms of the Internet, trying to understand my grandma\\'s condition, provided me with the tools I needed to properly care for her. I gave her space when she needed it, assured her that she was safe when she felt anxious, and used music to soothe her when she was upset. Some moments during my care, I\\'d catch a glimpse of those two comforting orbs I once knew, a sense of tenderness and familiarity I never expected to see again. It is because of those instances that I refuse to believe in \\'impossible\\'.My grandma\\'s disease allowed my curiosity to flourish endlessly, my only antidote: finding answers. As part of the AP Capstone research program, I use my research to answer the one question Google, Yahoo Answers, and Bing failed to answer: How could I prevent Alzheimer\\'s Disease from shattering the dynamics of other families? I finally found my answer. Physicians base their diagnoses off anatomical \\'markers\\' such as hippocampal volume or MRI scans, but this method fails to predict the future progression of the disease. Through my research, I utilize statistics and computer modeling to predict early signs of Alzheimer\\'s and take into account future clinical decline. By doing so, I hope my early-detection model will not only give patients access to treatments before the disease worsens, but also give their loved ones time to prepare for the transformative journey ahead. I still have the same, insatiable desire that penetrated the search histories of my school\\'s computer lab. I plan on channeling my devotion to research into a degree in biology, so that I may better understand the complexities of life. But most importantly, I want to be an inspiration to all the young boys and girls who feel like strangers to the ones they love most. I want them to understand that with curiosity, they, too, may do the impossible.If you could meet a character from a book or a historical figure, who would it be and what would you ask them?

The image led to monumental breakthroughs for biologists, Watson and Crick, who received Nobel Prizes for realizing the double-helical backbone of DNA.

Despite her work going unrecognized, Franklin continued her research, shifting her focus to the structure of viruses.

It was outrageous that her contribution to this ground-breaking discovery went unnoticed, but what mattered was that Franklin fulfilled each of her responsibilities as a scientist and influential figure. She devoted her life to the improvement of mankind until her very last breath.

It wasn\\'t difficult to see that he had passed away to fish heaven. I held an elaborate funeral for him, complete with a eulogy and a symphony playing in the background as I made the final flush. The mournful tribute I had written for my goldfish titled \\'Dead Denny\\' was probably the first poem I ever wrote in my life. That day, I lost one of my first friends but soon realized that I had made another. This one, albeit, took a rather peculiar form: writing. If writing took a tangible body, my younger self would probably describe it as having purple hair, infinite superpowers, and a mischievous smile. I had always been a shy introvert so writing was one of my few best friends- someone who grasped my hand and pulled me into my own limitless imagination in a time when my first inclination to anything, deemed too daunting, was to say no. I never saw writing as just writing. It was almost a person to me- one that took part in my wildest adventures and gave me comfort. When I was fourteen years old, I went to summer camp to take a writing course. There, I met a boy who had broad shoulders and sunkissed hair. We only knew each other for the short few weeks of camp but we quickly became friends. That summer was filled with his corny jokes and Baltimore sunsets. It was after the camp ended when I received the news that he had died in a freak accident. What do you do when you\\'re fourteen and the reality of death hits you like an earthquake: fast, unexpected, and terrifying? I wrote a deeply personal memoir. Then, at the urging of my English teacher, I submitted it to a national writing competition where it received a silver medal. While in the past I had relied on writing to flee from my fears, it slowly coaxed me to confront them. I submitted more pieces to competitions to be judged by strangers, something that was unthinkable in the past. I tried out for the Yearbook Club and discovered that I loved sharing a common passion and treasured the thrill of creating something that lasts forever. The very thing that had pulled me further into my own self as a child was now what thrust me into the great unknown that I had been so afraid of.When I was seventeen years old, my grandmother passed away from a sudden heart attack. I thought I understood death from what had happened three years ago but standing in the grossly fluorescent hospital room, holding her cold hands in mine, I realized with a shattering jolt that I truly didn\\'t. How could someone who had been dancing in the kitchen just a few days ago suddenly be gone? I tried to write an eulogy for her funeral but I couldn\\'t find the words to describe her. Words that had always flowed so effortlessly from my fingertips now seemed unfamiliar in my hands. Since I was young, writing had been there for me. That day I discovered that, almost like having a mind of its own, writing could also leave me. It would have been easier to blame the separate entity I had made writing to be, to ask why and how it could fail me when it should have been there for me. But I\\'ve learned that writing isn\\'t a purple-haired superhero with a coy smile. It is not even a person. I am the writer and the superpower lies with me: to create a story, to say goodbye to someone too soon. And maybe as all superheros do - to save the world in my own, small way.When I was seven, I wrote my first book. As I scribbled passionately about kids riding a magical elevator to find their lost dogs, I realized that my first great love wasn\\'t a booger-picking boy who shared his crayons with me. It was writing.Like all great love affairs, this one started off as a teensy crush. Writing short poems was like a few covert glances between a boy and a girl. It slowly dawned on me that words weren\\'t just syllables strung together. They were land mines filled with unexplored ideas waiting to be told.

Still, excitement subsided and writing became something I did to pass the time\\\\u2014a casual hookup if you will.

Writing became the special someone that made my insecurities vanish.All long-term relationships encounter a rough patch\\\\u2014\\'It\\'s not you, it\\'s me.

She had passed away to fish heaven. I held an elaborate funeral to the amusement of my mother- complete with a eulogy and a melancholy symphony as I made the final flush.I\\'ve always loved animals, no matter how small or insignificant they seemed. I could watch ants move a single crumb across a playground for hours. One summer, I realized that Seoul had over 200,000 feral cats living within its borders. I had seen skeletal cats roaming the streets but never really thought about them dying from starvation, cold, disease, or abuse. After a little bit of research, I found that these stray cats rarely live beyond five years.Determined to do something, I found a local cat shelter called Nabiya that took in stray cats. I volunteered to help with the laundry, clean litterboxes, feed, vacuum, mop, and more. Once school started, I realized that a lot of clubs focused on global issues such as North Korean defectors or adopting a child from Africa - but none helped the insignificant and often forgotten such as stray cats that were dying in our own city. I founded the Nabiya Club at my school, partnering with the very organization that I was volunteering at, where I organized fundraisers and hosted monthly shelter visits for club members to actively help the cats. We raised over $2,000 to foot the medical bills of two critically injured cats that would have died otherwise. When I explain to fellow students about Nabiya, they usually chuckle at my \\'cat-club\\' as it has been dubbed. But I believe my club is more than just helping stray cats. It\\'s a step towards helping the often forgotten. I believe the community needs someone who recognizes this importance; someone willing to care for something that may seem trivial in comparison to all the other issues in the world. Perhaps even someone who is willing to hold a funeral for a small goldfish.It\\'s hard to pinpoint what truly makes me different from other amazing applicants. Is it my grades and test scores? No. My eclectic extracurriculars? Probably not. But one thing that truly sets me apart is my family and how each has shaped me.My mom is small in stature but big in everything else including her voice and opinions. Her English is broken so I grew up listening to her rapid Korean. Because kids attending international schools are typically isolated from the mainstream society, my mom made sure that I didn\\'t lose my Korean identity by teaching me difficult Korean phrases and making me watch Kdramas. Besides my almond eyes and oval face, I also inherited my mom\\'s tenacity, pride, and her love for learning.My dad represents the American side of me - he understands my dry humor and loves discussing current events. He grew up in Korea but immigrated to California in his teens not knowing any English. He always tells me how much harder he had to work in school just to achieve the same results as his peers. While I am inspired by his struggles, I know that his story is not mine. I was fortunate to receive an amazing education and constant support - my dad taught me never to take my privileges for granted.My twin sister...well, she\\'s in a class of her own. My fiercest competitor and best friend, she is the most fearless person I know. She has pushed me, a shy introvert, to never let the fear of failure dictate my actions. It\\'s also through being compared to her that I have learned the importance of individuality and being my own person.I know that my academic achievements or the clubs that I have founded does not differentiate me from other competitive applicants. It is the values that I possess, the family that raised me, and the fusion of two contrasting cultures that I grew up with that makes me unique. I am not just my parent\\'s daughter, a twin sister, Korean, or even American. I am all of the above. To the many pedestrians passing by us on the street, we must have been quite an amusing sight: a large group of high schoolers holding a giant inflatable globe, huge posters, and a teenage boy dressed up like the Grim Reaper. But to me, this strange sight was the culmination of all the hard work that I, along with all my other club members, had put into a single event. The Climate Finance Integrity awareness campaign had been a project that the club that I had founded, Transparency SFS, had been working on tirelessly for the past months. Perhaps it was this same tenacity and passion for global change that turned a simple email to the managing director of Transparency Korea, one of the branches of the international NGO Transparency International, into something so much bigger. Our partnership with the global organization started from an interest in anti-corruption which was fueled by the Park Geun-hye scandal plaguing our own country\\'s government. Only a few weeks later, I was told that I would be in charge of leading an awareness campaign along with my other club members in the busy streets of Seoul. I lead my club in designing brochures about our cause and creating huge poster-boards with surveys pedestrians could fill out. We bought a huge inflatable globe and a Grim Reaper costume as a way to attract the attention of passersby. As my first time in leading large-scale event, it would be a lie to say I didn\\'t have my doubts. Would my leadership fail miserably? Would people even care about our cause?But standing in the cold streets with my peers, united by a single passion, I realized the size of the crowd we attracted was not what mattered. It was the fact that we were there, trying to bring awareness to something we believed in. I learned that leadership is so much more than just being in charge. It is taking that first initiative to turn something small into something meaningful. After all, who knew a single email would turn into a 40-people event?\"}, {\"index\": 27, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Growing up with a surgical nurse mom, I had only seen the noble and glorified version of medicine: people saving lives. However, after seeing and working with sick people who desperately sought medical support, I realized that the medical system, at best, saves lives selectively. At the beginning of my sophomore year, I was dissatisfied with the limited opportunities the hospital I volunteered at provided and wondered whether medicine was really for me. Not only did I question whether it was the culturally easy choice because it was the \\'stable and respectable\\' job Asians should absolutely consider, but I also struggled to give a clear reason why healthcare attracted me. In my search to find a volunteer experience I felt more connected to, I found a free medical clinic called City Impact that strives to serve the underserved in the marginalized neighborhoods of San Francisco. There, I encountered the reality of healthcare. Because I didn\\'t know how to take a patient\\'s blood pressure, one of the volunteer medical students had to demonstrate the steps on me. He swiftly wrapped the cuff around my upper left arm, squeezed the bulb until I lost feeling, and slowly turned the little dial connected to the pump. \\'120/78, that\\'s pretty good,\\' he said before lecturing on systolic and diastolic numbers. After his five minute medical school summary, he asked if I was ready to see my first patient. I nervously smiled and quickly excused myself to the bathroom. No one knew that I was crouching down in the corner of the bathroom, searching for a \\'How to Measure Blood Pressure Manually\\' video on YouTube. In the examination room, the patient looked confused because he had come for new toiletries, and I didn\\'t understand why I was allowed to take his vitals. Using a combination of Spanish, English, and hand motions, we awkwardly agreed that I could take his vitals. After following exactly the medical student\\'s steps, I carefully noted the systolic and diastolic numbers: 125/80. Perfect. I was happy the patient\\'s numbers were normal and even happier I managed to successfully take his vitals, despite my inexperience. Because of this unusual circumstance of having to teach myself medical procedures, I unexpectedly confronted an unsettling reality of healthcare: those most in need do not get what they need. Among the hard-working volunteers I met, there is even a cardiologist who dedicates his time once a month to serve the people at the clinic; still, I recognized how there is a clear shortage of attention for the most needy, because the system is broken. Because of this confounding realization, I found myself wondering whether being poor meant that one is less human and deserves less. I began to consider how I could challenge the inequity and create a new paradigm of healthcare. First, people have to acknowledge that medical inequity is a serious problem and needs attention. Second, we have to start considering the patients\\' needs before the business\\' needs. Finally, we need to encourage many more people to care about those financially struggling and to take action. The solution is complex, but in a world that is so starkly divided between the people who have and the have nots, it cannot be so divided when dealing with life or death.In this ramshackle clinic in an ignored area of the city, the unexpected injustice for these marginalized patients is an untrained high school student is allowed to touch them and take their vitals. Yet, they are people just like us, and deserve equal quality care that is blind to patient details outside of medical condition. I\\'m good at what I do, but make no mistake. I am not a doctor. I am not a nurse. I am just a high school student with a BART card and the compassion and gumption to show up. \"}, {\"index\": 28, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Left!\\' Five hundred legs from five rows of cadets hit the ground with a resounding thud in response to the drill sergeant. \\'Right!\\' The morning air is crisp. A slight drizzle blends in with the beads of sweat dripping down my face. \\'Left!\\' A dribble of liquid reaches my lips-not the cold neutral flavor of rain, but a distinct warm metallic taste.Blood. It gushes out as my heart rate increases, making me look like a guest of the Red Wedding. Why am I, a short, unathletic night owl awake at 4:30 AM and running at the United States Military Academy West Point?Because I wanted to do what I thought was impossible.When a family friend bragged about attending West Point Summer Leaders Experience, I didn\\'t think much of it because there was no way I could survive physically. After joining football on a whim freshman year and ending the season with a concussion and a broken foot, I threw out my dreams of being a varsity athlete. Over the course of sophomore year, all of my athleticism eroded away as my abs turned into flabs and the steel hard thighs gained from daily deadlifts became mush. Yet, the thought of getting back in shape and trying new activities kept nagging at me. After a year of not doing any workouts aside from PE class, I went on my first run.I sucked.I went from sprinting a seven-minute mile freshman year to barely grinding through my first run with a combination of jogging, walking, and undignified, doglike panting. Seeing this dramatic shift made me realize just how much I declined, which motivated me to get back in shape. Going to West Point became a far-off goal to measure how much I improved; I wanted to be able to hold my own against all of the D1 recruited athletes who attended. To be honest, I also really wanted to shoot a rocket launcher.1 mile down. My lungs begin to tighten. Later, I will realize that struggling to breathe isn\\'t normal when I become diagnosed with asthma. But in this moment, I simply focus on my goal: move my feet forward. Left. Right. Left. Right.If there is a word to describe me, it\\'s persistent. Defeat is a foreign notion to me. The fitness requirements for West Point seemed daunting for someone who hadn\\'t worked out for a whole year. But I pushed through, one rep at a time, one foot in front of another every morning before school. Slowly but surely, the number of pushups, sit-ups, and pull-ups, as well as my mile time, improved. While it was hard to justify my suffering when my sore and shaking arms couldn\\'t even use a pipette in morning AP Bio labs, I soldiered on because quitting would be admitting defeat, confirming that I cannot accomplish the impossible.1.5 miles down. Still bleeding and breathing heavily, a mechanical determination drives me down the field. \\'Left, right, left, right...\\' beats like a metronome in my head. As I ignore the lactic acid buildup in my thighs, constriction in my chest, and blood spewing through my nose, I realize how my mental strength is stronger than any physical obstacle. Every signal in my body begs me to stop, but I refuse to yield.Ultimately my asthma disqualified me from pursuing a military career, but these moments of pushing past obstacles proved clarifying for me.I survive and march back to the barracks, straight into the shower without taking off my blood-caked clothes. The torrent of cold water batters off me, turning the ground and the dead cockroaches on it salmon pink. Against all odds, I, the short, unathletic night owl, made it.If I could conquer what I thought was impossible, what will stop me in the future?Left. Right. Left. Right. \"}, {\"index\": 29, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I always conflicted over the desire to hide my \\'differences\\' or embrace my Korean heritage. Ashamed of being Asian, I never imagined myself to one day lead others to accept their differences. In freshman year, I partook in a program where I was taught valuable lessons about stereotyping, tolerance, empathy, and the importance of diversity. At the end of that day, I wanted to serve as a leader next. I joined the organization called Griffins With A Mission (GWAM) every year after that. As a leader, I encouraged the freshmen to respect oneself and others. It was with GWAM that I realized to appreciate my individuality. I am not inferior for having a lower economic status or being Asian, and in the same way others are not inferior to me. GWAM allows me to convey these realizations to others, and I still carry the lessons it taught me today. My dad was diagnosed with a late stage of colon cancer when I was in the fifth grade. At that time, I could not completely grasp what was going on and only knew that my dad was going away for a few months to receive his operation. My mom soon became the sole breadwinner in the family. A month into my dad\\'s departure, the bills started piling up on our kitchen counter. Today, my family is still recovering from those medical costs. To make ends meet, my parents sold their small business and drifted to and from multiple odd jobs. I have experienced what economic hardship does to people as I saw my mom suffer both physically and mentally from our situation. A few years later in high school, I came to the understanding and realization of how much my parents sacrificed to keep us afloat and afford academic opportunities for me. The struggle of my parents to care for us while providing in times of illness and emergency became my inspiration and driving force. With this newfound clarity, I took it upon myself to challenge and push myself harder in school. Not only did I want to make my parents proud, but I wanted to prove something to myself. I took the most advanced classes offered at my school and finally obtained a 5.0 GPA in my Junior year. Through my achievements I demonstrated to my parents, as well as to myself, my capabilities in balancing schoolwork on top of my extracurriculars, piano lessons, and volunteer work. However, none of this was easy. Several times, I felt like giving up when it seemed like my work had no end. But in these difficult moments, I persevered by recalling the sacrifices and resilience of my parents. Now, I commit myself to academic excellence not just for myself but also for my parents. I believe in attaining a successful future to continue the dream of America my parents sought while crossing the Pacific Ocean for their children\\'s futures. As a Korean from the Asian Pacific American Islander (AAPI) community, I recognized how taboo the subject of \\'mental health\\' was among many first-generation immigrants. Fortunately, I became aware of the topic during my early teenage years scrolling through posts on my Tumblr feed. Soon, my interest in psychology rose in because it is interconnected with concepts on how and why the brain functions and degrades the way it does. My fascination in the matter only grew when I took AP Psychology my junior year in high school. Because of this interest, when the opportunity to create my own research project came to me in collaboration with Capstone, I was stoked to research mental illness. With my awareness I understood how under-discussed but important the subject of mental illness is, so I wondered how my fellow classmates felt. I had a positive point of view on the matter meaning I don\\'t see mentally challenged individuals as people to be pitied or \\'different\\'. However, I knew the negative stigma surrounding it and wondered if my peers reflected those views. I created a survey with questions on how one perceives mental illness, where those perceptions come from (the community, culture, social media), and what causes them to have those perceptions. My results surprised me in that most of my surveyed classmates held positive impressions like me and more than half indicated they knew someone who had been diagnosed with mental illness. This proved to me how prevalent mental illness is and how psychology can be used to broaden those realizations. Psychology is a powerful subject that widened my understanding of others and formulated questions in me that I sought to answer. I was a shy and reserved person growing up, never taking risks to make myself vulnerable. I was constantly bogged down by feelings of inferiority due to my socioeconomic background in comparison to my white and affluent classmates. It was not up until high school that I learned to stand up for myself and challenge my insecurities. Junior year, I created a club to raise awareness about animal welfare, which is one of my passions. Through that experience, I found myself leadings meetings attended by over sixty members. I volunteered to be a mentor for the younger peers leading discussions on empathy, racial hatred, and stereotypes. For the first time, I took the initiative to approach others instead of waiting to be approached. Today, I am eager to put myself into new environments and appreciate the growth that new experiences give me. During the summer of 2017, I participated in an exchange program that placed me in Quanzhou, China. At first, I harbored prejudices and misgivings about a foreign nation like China. But by placing myself in a completely unfamiliar setting without the supervision or guidance of my parents, my sense of independence and resourcefulness thrived. I connected with the local Chinese despite a language barrier and carried out my responsibilities without being told to do so. My time abroad and growing sense of confidence over the course of high school has readied me for the new challenges that will be brought on in college. The development in my self-awareness, global perspective, and my inclination to lead others will make me a successful individual seasoned for the prestige of the University of California schools. I am thrilled by the potential for further growth and believe in my capabilities to flourish in this institution. I was always a shy, reserved person growing up, never taking risks to make myself vulnerable. I was constantly bogged down by feelings of inferiority because of my socio-economic background and compared myself to my white, affluent classmates. I felt unlucky to be Asian and fantasized about how different life would be if I were \\'white\\'. It was not until high school that I started to stand up for myself and be proud of who I am. Tired of hiding my true identity, I took the initiative to push myself and challenge my insecurities. I created a club to raise awareness about animal welfare, an issue of great importance to me. Suddenly, I found myself leading a meeting with over 60 members with the same interest. I volunteered to be a mentor for freshmen and lead discussions on empathy, racial hatred, and stereotypes. To my younger peers, I shared stories about my experiences that they could learn from. I took the initiative to approach others and emerge from my comfortable social bubble. Upon reflection, I learned to value these experiences because of the ways they made me grow. Soon after, I would quite literally step outside my comfort zone. During the summer of 2017, I participated in an exchange program that placed me in Quanzhou, China. For over two weeks, I lived with a host family, exploring the culture, traditions, and historical sites of a smaller Chinese city. The program allowed me to develop close-knit relationships with the people and gain a more intimate understanding of the culture, rather than losing myself in a chaotic metropolis like Beijing or Shanghai. Initially, I was afraid of going to a foreign country by myself. I was filled with concerns about how dirty China would be, the danger of being in a communist country, and uneasiness about how Chinese people were \\'not nice.\\' However, these worries dissipated almost instantly as my host family welcomed me with utmost consideration and introduced me to everything Quanzhou had to offer.In Quanzhou, people lead lifestyles dramatically different from those to which I am accustomed. From concerns about food and transportation, to human interactions and language barriers, I worried that I would have difficulty assimilating to my new environment and associating with a foreign people. But despite our differences, I found myself connecting with my host family. I bonded with my host sister, the only one who could speak English, over complaints about the unbearable humidity, laughed over the same jokes, shared meals and confessed thrilling secrets. Through this program, Quanzhou and its people became more than an unknown, unimportant city to me. My home for those two weeks became a real community filled with individuals living real lives. My invaluable experience in China gave me the strength to overcome my feelings of internalized shame and inferiority. My host family taught me to accept my cultural, racial, and economic differences through their openness to share their own culture. Looking back, I became cognizant of my own prejudices about a place that I had never been. In addition, the trip also developed my sense of independence. I left home afraid of going to a foreign country without the security of any friends or family. But instead, I returned with new friends and met a supportive host family. In this entirely new setting, I learned to hold myself accountable for my own actions and decisions. No one told me how to behave or speak, so I became more conscious of how I portrayed myself as a person. The times in China have prepared me to be a more adept individual comfortable with new environments and people. I owe the growth of my confidence in who I am and what I can do to this experience.  Now, I am ready to face any challenges that may come my way because I treasure how they will cultivate me as an individual. \"}, {\"index\": 30, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Please paste your personal statement essay below.

At the age of eight, I began to question the significance ofmy \\'obligatory\\' morning prayers. While children often follow the principles set by their parentswithout question, I found it difficult to simply acquiesce. And so, I decided to put my morningprayers on pause until I formed my own relationship with religion.My parents had differing reactions to my decision. While my mother, a devout Hindu, expressedher disagreement, my father compromised and granted me a greater sense of independence tocome to my own conclusions. However, even he subtly confessed that while he did notnecessarily agree with all the finer aspects of our religion, he found no harm in praying due tothe social expectations surrounding it. Nevertheless, I could not bring myself to simply follow areligion due to societal pressure and continued my search for my spirituality elsewhere.Surprisingly, I soon realized that \\'elsewhere\\' was as close as my backyard and the neighboringwoods around it.

It was only 6am, yet the town was already buzzing. Cars and buses sped up and down the streets, zooming towards the sprawled-out plazas among the few lakes and trees. Droves of people entered the many shops for their morning breakfast before work. I observed all of these events as I was watching the sunrise from the top of a sledding hill one morning. What a lively scene, I thought to myself. Everyone is up and about quite early. Vernon Hills is a town that I am proud of. From past constructions of infrastructure to recent renovations of the mall and old plazas, the community I know is one that is constantly developing, innovating, and trying to better the quality of life for everyone. Its focus on commercial activity has built a strong foundation for educational success and has created numerous opportunities for employment and personal growth. Yet something felt awfully wrong about that scene. It wasn\\'t the livelihood of the town. Neither was it the possible disturbance of the morning quiet. Could it be the economic dichotomy existing between the two sides of the town: Gregg\\'s Landing and the other neighborhoods? Indeed, there was a sharp financial contrast between the two parts of town, one filled with grandiose houses and pristine lawns, and the others, lackluster, grey structures with barely enough grass to be considered a lawn. No. The issue was much deeper than that. It was not until I participated in a classroom discussion of the racially-driven divisions that I discovered what had bothered me that very day. As I was pondering on top of that hill, behind me was one of the poorer, adjacent neighborhoods to Gregg\\'s Landing. There lived the Hispanics, Middle Easterners, and other minorities, reminded daily of their misfortunes by the towering houses less than a mile to their side. With a few exceptions, those living in Gregg\\'s Landing were predominantly white.  Something did not make sense. Vernon Hills boasted of its diversity and continually pushed for equality. I also learned that segregation was outlawed years ago in 1954 in all my history classes.Then how could this economic segregation occur right before my eyes, nearly 60 years after its abolishment! I am still deeply troubled by this astonishing discovery. There is no way to abolish this implicit sort of segregation; it\\'s subtle form is far more frightening than when it had legality. How are the citizens of Vernon Hills supposed to combat something that is not explicit but still pervading all of society? I have no answers, but I know that if nothing is done to address this underlying problem, no matter how financially successful or how stable the educational system is, the racial barriers will continue to be reinforced. I fear that Vernon Hills will fall back into the darkness. The first step must be to illuminate this extensive issue, whether quickly or gradually.\"}, {\"index\": 33, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'I WANT MY MOMMY!\\' one of my students cried, inciting the other children to cry in unison. I was prepared to teach, but I had no idea how to console a class of screaming toddlers. Afterward, I contemplated quitting. My expectations for teaching were far different from the reality. Despite feeling overwhelmed, I remembered Children\\'s Church\\'s impact on me as a child and remained committed. Teaching Children\\'s Church for seven years has taught me the importance of adapting to my surroundings, being resilient, and leading effectively. Teaching toddlers taught me how to adapt. I had no clue that I had to be a caregiver as well as a teacher. Learning to read emotions and anticipate my students\\' needs was instrumental in building trust and establishing a relationship with the kids, and, after months of teaching, I could tell what a student wanted before they told me. Learning to adapt helped me during my freshman year of high school. In my Algebra class, I did not grasp concepts as quickly as I did in middle school and struggled to succeed on tests that were far more complex than the homework assignments. To improve, I completed additional practice problems each night and created my own study guides. At the end of the year, I finished with an A average. Whenever I am faced with a new challenge, I will adapt and succeed. Teaching pre-teens taught me resilience. Initially, I was worried when my students would complain during my lessons, but I remained resilient. To make the experience more interactive and engaging, I used music and technology. Being resilient helped me when I transferred into the New Jersey Law and Education Empowerment Project (NJLEEP) during my junior year of high school. NJLEEP added completing monthly essays and vocabulary quizzes for Saturday Writing class and reading constitutional case law, writing 10-page legal briefs, and preparing and delivering 10-minute oral arguments for Constitutional Law Debates to an already heavy workload. In my first debate, I competed against more experienced students, performed poorly, and lost. Remaining resilient allowed me to learn from my failure. I used outside research to supplement my argument, while focusing more my brief\\'s content rather than simply meeting the page requirement. I also practiced my argument for weeks until I had memorized it. At the next debate, I was nominated for the Best Brief Award. Because I am resilient, failure is my teacher.Teaching my peers taught me leadership. I had to take charge and be assertive, because my students were my friends. I was also responsible for creating my own lesson plans, which meant I had to prepare well in advance of each class. Learning leadership was useful when I was elected Homeroom Representative for Student Council. I had to be assertive to voice my classmates\\' concerns and ideas to school leadership and prepared to keep everyone in my homeroom informed. When Student Council planned a school walkout to show our solidarity with Stoneman Douglas High School, I suggested we also use the walkout to highlight concerns we had with our school\\'s lack of safety. Coming together as a student body to support Stoneman Douglas and to present our concerns to our school\\'s administration led to our principal revising our school\\'s safety plan. Learning to lead peers at church prepared me to lead my peers at high school.Teaching children\\'s church has taught me adaptation, resilience, and leadership. Because I will carry these traits with me to college, I know I will succeed. While teaching has been an invaluable experience, I love being a student, so I look forward to everything college has to offer. I will always do my best, so that I can continue to teach my students from afar, by showing them the path to academic and professional success.\"}, {\"index\": 34, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Predominantly Catholic, absolutely caucasian, and mostly Lithuanian-speaking, my homeland of Lithuania is not exactly a diverse country. At first, I viewed the fact as a huge downside - so much potentially life-changing perspective is lost in the absence of diversity, after all.But, as I reflected on the big decisions I\\'ve made in my life, I came to realize the lack of diversity in my immediate surroundings has actually had its advantages.For one thing, my want for diversity brought me into the refugee and migrant community. From the get-go, I was exposed to extreme diversity. Differences - great and minor - would reveal themselves every minute of the discussions I organized. So much laughter would erupt, so many eyebrows would be raised, so insightful was every sentence of dialogue that my head would ache from the colossal amount of information I was trying to sponge up. Beyond informative, it forced me to rethink my own cultural identity.Of course, it wasn\\'t all smooth sailing - sometimes there would be a gap between students in my Lithuanian classes or my mentees in our meetings. Regardless of whether the misunderstanding was of cultural or linguistic nature, I made it my job to intervene, tear down the barriers, and build bridges. Doing this time over time has made me better at resolving conflict and encouraging cooperation.I realize now that the absence of diversity has also been a major contributor to my passion for the social sciences. As a student of history, I\\'ve always seen my textbooks as tickets abroad rather than just into the past. Piecing together the various historical events and attitudes to form a colorful mosaic that depicts how foreign nations lived. Even more captivating, economics explained to me why societies diverge not only in culture but in wealth, too. Immersing myself in these and other academic fields allowed me to travel the globe while sitting in the library.And when I started to upload my art online, my search for diversity allowed me to directly connect to people from around the world. Garnering thousands of comments, the comment sections under my works act as a platform for debate on various global issues, allowing me to hear perspectives from all corners of the planet. Moreover, the comments can be a way for citizens of censored countries to speak out. Kazachstan or another undemocratic nation may silence its press, but people\\'s voices can and do find refuge in the comment sections of art. Enabling such public discourse and seeing such a diversity of opinion under my creations, therefore, further fuels my passion for making real, thought-provoking art.Although my background may not be interesting to hear about, it has molded who I am. It has nudged me towards the communities I most love, influenced the disciplines I have chosen to pursue and even determined my biggest hobbies. It is this unique relationship with diversity and the lessons I\\'ve learned thanks to it that I now hope to bring to college.\"}, {\"index\": 35, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The Courage To Say Yes I was 12, riding a bike in a pink tutu. A smiling woman labeled \\'VOLUNTEER\\' handed me a pin. \\'Congratulations, you are officially a five mountain pass finisher of the Death Ride\\'. These words meant more than simply being the youngest participant to complete the 130 mile race. Standing at the top of that mountain represented months of perseverance and courage. I discovered I possess the strength to chase my dreams and reach them.When I was 11, I fell in love with cycling. The thrill of summiting a mountain with the simple aid of a 15-pound bike gave me a sense of bravery I would not have been able to find elsewhere. My father signed us up for the intimidating Death Ride, and we trained with a fierce regimen, biking 50-100 miles per day to prepare for the climb.  My mother said no. It was too strenuous and dangerous. A 12 year old is supposed to take dance classes, choir, or theater, but nothing else gave me that feeling of invincibility. Each time I heard \\'No\\', a voice in my head bellowed, \\'Yes\\', daring me, \\'Work harder, prove them wrong!\\' I relish in a challenge and thrive when pushing myself.I was 14, standing tall at the front of the room, leading 35 adults in their weekly Vinyasa class at Mission Yoga in San Francisco. Sweat dripped down their foreheads as their thighs quivered to sustain the contorted Eagle pose. I was their teacher. After practicing for years, I decided to enroll in a 200 hour teacher training at my local studio. I convinced the director to let a 13 year old girl train, raising money to pay for it through babysitting and lemonade stands. Every weekend of eighth grade, I devoted 8 hours to study the Yoga Sutras, practice giving precise instruction for poses, and explore the physiological effects of yoga through a graduate level human cadaver dissection. Though studying yoga brought me unparalleled joy and a sense of purpose, I encountered the word \\'No\\' everywhere. My middle school teachers told me I should be doing something more appropriate for an eighth grader. These doubts, however, only fueled my motivation. A year later, I found myself standing in that room, teaching tech executives how to stretch their hamstrings. I was 16 when I began my work at a Stanford genetics laboratory. Though I was often told high school students don\\'t have a place at a graduate research facility, I was determined to succeed. Eventually, I completed my own project in collaboration with a PhD student and discovered the drive I possess for scientific research. I dream of intellectual and moral pursuits, of slowing aging in the brain, of .conducting the first human brain transplant, of transforming science education in public schools. I dream of venturing into the jungles of Vietnam, searching for plants that possess compounds to fight antibiotic-resistant superbugs. I have always been met with the word \\'No\\'. No, you are not old enough. No, you are not strong enough, mature enough, good enough. These assumptions have never deterred me from pursuing my dreams, and they never will. On the contrary, they push me to enjoy the climb. I attribute this courage, perhaps, to my multicultural upbringing; as a Jewish Argentinian American girl, I was told that expectations and stereotypes are rarely accurate and generally detrimental. It has been instilled within me that, regardless of what others believe, I am an individual capable of realizing my greatest ambitions. In my past, I was told \\'No\\' because I was too young. In my future, it might be because I am a woman, or because I am Jewish, or because I am Latina, or because I do not conform to all societal expectations. I know this simple word cannot stop me from changing the world. All it takes is the courage to say yes.\"}, {\"index\": 36, \"new_personal_statement\": \"A sea of fuchsia-stained nuclei appeared in my field of vision. The neurons in the spider\\'s brain were like pomegranate seeds, thousands squished into each of the brain\\'s lobes. Layers upon layers, a beaded sculpture made from cells with neural connections twining them together. How many neurons could there be? And if such a small creature possessed so many neurons, what about humans? I tried to scale up my mental sculpture to match, but I failed to conjure up the billions of pomegranate seeds needed.I was in a lab at St. Michael\\'s College in Vermont examining the impact of overstimulation on the neural connections of the C. salei spider. Spiders that experienced overstimulation showed signs of neurodegeneration, as if the pomegranate seeds in the spiders\\' brains had rotted. This phenomenon may play a role in the development of human diseases like Alzheimer\\'s or multiple sclerosis. I was fascinated by this similarity between spider and human brains\\\\u2014it amazed me that research on one species could teach us so much about another.Yet, I couldn\\'t stop thinking about how similar two human brains could be\\\\u2014specifically, my twin brother\\'s and my own.Our alikeness has manifested itself in every possible way, from our looks to our thoughtful, compassionate personalities. Our biggest similarity is our love of classical music. While Bach, Haydn, and Mendelssohn make our peers yawn, dopamine and serotonin flood our brains when we dive into the intricacies of the music. But as I entered high school, I grew tired of having a near clone. We were always \\'the Wu\\'s,\\' mutually reinforcing parts of a larger whole. Hoping to find a niche only I could occupy, I turned to cross country and Nordic skiing, but Henry\\'s presence still haunted me. In races, cheers of \\'Go Henry!\\' would ring out from parents and friends, commonly followed by alarmed whispers of \\'Oh wait, was that Nathan?!\\' Even when I thought I had finally found a passion that was purely my own in the form of biological research, Henry promptly got involved as well, helping out in the very same lab.Yet, one day, while performing Brahms\\'s \\'Sonatensatz\\' together at an honors recital, something amazing happened. We took our spots\\\\u2014Henry at the piano, me in front of him, violin in hand. After a restless introduction, we broke out into the energetic first theme, matching each other\\'s driving triplet rhythms note for note. I had tried so hard to find paths that took me in a different direction from Henry, yet here I was, right in step with him. As we moved together with the gentle swells of the trio section, my mind drifted to my spider research. I imagined pomegranate seeds sending shoots out to touch other seeds, spurred on by our soaring melody. Suddenly, I realized it didn\\'t matter that spider and human brains\\\\u2014or even twins\\' brains\\\\u2014behave in the same way. The whole point was to examine how external effects cause the brain to develop differently. Variations and similarities are not inborn but develop through experience, so no two brains are exactly alike\\\\u2014not even those of twins. A year after my research at St. Michael\\'s and ten months after our recital, I have come to terms with the fact that I did not need to be so worried about being too similar to Henry all these years. Our differentiation from each other was inevitable. Our now-unique passions would have flourished of their own accord. Now, I have a new preoccupation\\\\u2014enjoying our final year together. We will likely attend different colleges, and life\\'s events will push us apart as we pursue different careers and journey into adulthood. As our paths diverge, so will our neural networks, forced by experiences that we do not both encounter. We will lose the many bonds we share. Now is the time, not for finding differences between us, but for celebrating our brotherhood\\\\u2014our common passions, traits, and neural connections.\"}, {\"index\": 37, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Dingdong!\\' Every five minutes, the bell rang ominously. One by one, patients arose from their waiting room seat and disappeared into the exam room. My mother and I waited for our turn to come, and I with each passing ringing of the bell, I became more anxious, while she remained unflustered. Her deafness, it seemed, had a small benefit. She had begun going deaf during her pregnancy, when an allergic reaction to an antibiotic damaged her ears. So, every year we took my mother to one of the largest hospitals in Seoul to have the otolaryngologist check her hearing aid. When our bell rang, we entered the exam room and sat before the doctor. Then, just a few minutesinto our conversation, the next bell rang, and the doctor rapidly scribbled a prescription note, after which the nurse ushered us out.Even though some patients came from distant islands to see the doctors, no medical exam could last more than five minutes. Because the hospital could not afford more doctors, treatments sped along at the rapid rhythm of the ceaseless bell. In Korea\\'s push to provide universal care, it had undermined the quality of care. When I think about the challenge of providing care that is both excellent and broadly available, the sound of the unforgiving bell haunts me. There had to be a better way. Basic economics asserts that technological advancement will shift both the supply and demand curves to the right, thereby increasing the overall number of patients offered medical service while quality remains unchanged. I began wondering how I could use more advanced modeling to improve both efficiency and quality.At first, I worried that math was too theoretical to provide solutions to a real-world problem. As I developed a more nuanced understanding of mathematics, I learned that math provided simple and broadly applicable rules that, if used creatively, could generate answers to nearly any problem. In college, I discovered data science in a statistics course, and I wondered if it could be used to generate insights into healthcare. For my final research paper in the class, I analyzed how rising administration costs in healthcare are associated with increased complexity of health insurance. However, the analysis could not be done without solving the limitation from a 1950s healthcare administration dataset. I used the data in subtle ways to derive patients\\' genders using an array of clues. I enjoyed crafting the code and felt the same sense of accomplishment I had felt while excelling in high school math and physics competitions, except in this instance I saw the immense potential practical value of using math to solve problems like rising health insurance rates. When I began college, I had done so intending to become a doctor, but the more I explored data science,the more I realized that I could use data to improve the lives of entire populations. Indeed, the thought of using math in a practical manner that helped real people was genuinely exciting for me.I explored data science at a deeper level during a research internship at the Korea EconomicResearch Institute, where I interpreted R codes for non-data scientists. Our team of data scientists identified patterns in healthcare costs and quality of healthcare using nationwide datasets, capturing the underlying problems of universal healthcare. Again, I heard the bell ringing and understoodthat it was a problem throughout Korea. Moreover, by takingonline data science courses from Coursera and through arranging conversations with researchers, I began to see that my skills and interests were those that an adept data scientist possesses. I loved the idea of doing work thatleveraged creativity and logic to solve real-world problems through team-based cooperation.Throughout Korea, the tell-tale \\'dingdong\\' sound still haunts the waiting rooms ofgovernment hospitals. I dream that one day my mother can sit in front of a doctor who can examine and converse with her without dreading the interruption of an unforgiving timer. Data science willempower me to make this dream a reality.During my third year working as a research assistant in the Department of Psychology in Korea University, I landed a volunteer position at Seoul\\'s Public Internet Addiction Recovery Center.When I arrived at the center, I was assigned to three elementary students: Kangmin, Hyunjae, and Jaehyuk. All three sat with their legs shaking and their eyes glued to their smartphones while I asked them questions about their Internet use. Their school transcripts contained poor grades, and their attendance records were unsatisfactory. Observing them gave me goosebumps, as I had been the same way in seventh and eighth grade. Two hours of trying to get them to open up to me wasn\\'t working. So I asked them if they wanted to skip this discussion and play games at the local PC caf\\\\u00e9 instead. They nodded excitedly, so we sneaked out just the way my seventh-grade P.E. teacher did with me, except he had the principal\\'s permission. Every day for four hours, we met at the center and went straight to the caf\\\\u00e9. Four hours of gaming was nothing to game-addicted students, who usually played 14 hours a day. Using my P.E. teacher\\'s tactic helped me get to know them. Kangmin began gaming to cope with stress from demanding schoolwork. Hyunjae was overwhelmed by the expectations his family had for him. Jaehyuk was being forced by bullies play games using their accounts to break the highest score records.Understanding the motives behind their addictive behavior was very helpful in finding solutions. Kangmin was transferred to a less rigorous school to give him more freedom to explore his academic interests. We introduced Hyunjae\\'s parents to a consultant and persuaded them to be more encouraging of Hyunjae\\'s accomplishments. As for Jaehyuk, we contacted the School Violence Measures Autonomy Committee of the school to discipline the bullies and protect Jaehyuk from further harassment. With such success, I was acknowledged as a Student Leader at the center the following year.In high school I realized that I had glossophobia, fear of public speaking. My anxiety was so severe that I had to take prescribed medication before any class presentation, but the medication caused uncomfortable symptoms of its own. It numbed my body in an intense way, causing me to just spill out my words without being able to feel or engage with the audience.Wanting to rid myself of glossophobia, I had always run for various leadership positions, volunteered to present ideas during small-group discussions, and initiated small talk with strangers. Although I made small improvements, I still needed to depend on the medication.I didn\\'t give up: I entered the campaign for Class Vice President. It required giving a Vice President Candidate speech in front of the entire class, and I promised myself I would not take any medication. I started speaking up more in class and volunteered during small-group presentations. I also participated in short five-minute presentation assignments. I wrote my VP speech a month before the speech date and practiced until I memorized it by heart. I was determined to overcome glossophobia by proving to myself that I could successfully give a major speech. I wanted this so badly that I did not even report other candidates when I saw them breaking the rules of the campaign, even though I could easily disqualify them. I wanted to win solely through my own performance.At last, the day of the VP speech finally came, and I gave it my all--without mistakes, without medication. All I heard after I finished were my peers shouting my campaign slogan \\'Go Ham!\\' Unfortunately, I had lost the campaign due to a vote separation in the senior class--a junior girl was the sole candidate in her class--but I knew I had overcome glossophobia. And I realized how much I loved making speeches. I made eye-contact with the audience, pointed out each class, and made the audience laugh and cry. It was an incredible feeling to know I was no longer controlled by fear.Because of my excessive gaming in middle school, I often slept in and skipped school, yet was in denial of my addiction. My GPAs at the time were 1.25, 1.38, and 1.00 (out of 4.00). My father, a psychiatrist, tried everything to help me. The school principal, my homeroom teacher, my best friends, and Ms. Oh--the most famous pediatric psychiatrist in Korea--counseled me to help me get back to school. After completing the first semester of eighth grade, our family moved to Pittsburgh. During the first week of school, I received a score of zero out of fifty on the \\'50 U.S. States Test\\' in history class. My teacher had given me a chance to retake the test. So I printed a copy of the U.S. map and began studying. I realized it only took me seven minutes to memorize twenty states. I made songs and flashcards to memorize more. Soon, I ended up memorizing all fifty. I realized that my gaming addiction had conditioned me to think that I was incapable of studying. This simple history test shattered this fear and reignited my desire to learn. Since then, I began taking my studies very seriously. I set short-term goals and enjoyed small wins on my own. Every time I completed an assignment or aced a test, it boosted my self-esteem. At the end of the year, I was prized a tablet for having the highest GPA in middle school. I was happy, but I broke the tablet in half as a promise that I would never let myself break down because of technology.I still use an old iPhone 5 that dies in 40 minutes and takes 50 seconds to load an application as a reminder of my past. My friends laugh at it, but really, so many youngsters are consumed with their phones, unable to socialize without it or concentrate. I still am an advocate of technological advancement, but I will always be aware of its potential drawbacks.I have been serving as a Peer Mentor at my school since tenth grade. Peer Mentors supervise incoming students by helping them adjust to school life. During school orientation programs, they meet with these students daily. I wanted to be involved in peer mentoring because I knew all too well what it was like to be a new kid in school. Throughout my school years, I have moved schools about six times. Through this position, I was able to meet students from all grades. Every year, students enter our school from all around the world, some coming from countries I have never even heard of. These students stand out as \\'different\\' and face the daunting task of assimilating to school culture and making a healthy circle of friends. From clich\\\\u00e9 ice-breaker activities to forming bonds through outdoor challenging activities such as survival camping, our Peer Mentors help them get to know one another and adapt to school life.I also mentored a senior who was struggling with substance abuse issues and depression. As a former game addict, I could relate to his state, so I took great care to reach out to him. His state was quite severe, however, so he was often irritable and unapproachable. It was difficult for me to watch him suffer and I sometimes doubted whether I could help him.I persuaded our Chief Residential Assistant to allow a two-month rehabilitation period for him. Since the local clinic lacked the necessary resources, we needed to take a two-hour drive to the Drug Rehabilitation Center for a more comprehensive program. I did my best to support him as a friend during this time. I also consulted my father, a psychiatrist. I stayed in touch with the student throughout winter break.Although he was not completely drug-free, he significantly decreased substance use and was able to stay in school. He is now a freshman at Penn State studying psychology and stays in touch with me by sharing what he\\'s learning about the field.\"}, {\"index\": 38, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Aiyah- what did you do to my turtle?!\\'\\'Uh, I can explain-\\'\\'Chelsea! The turtle\\'s not the right shade of green anymore !\\' Mark screamed and threw his paintbrush at my face.There are few things in the world I take pleasure in: tearing perforated paper, weeding books from my room, and painting colorful walls.From a young age, I was fascinated with walls. They intrigued me- how a single barrier could break friendships, kindle loves, even harm those who worshipped them.Mostly, though, I was obsessed with blank walls and their endless possibilities. Boy-band posters, 100% math tests, even unicorn drawings decorated my bedroom walls. The bathroom walls were finger-painted with water, and I marveled as my dripping unicorns vanished into thin air. My most daring escapade \\\\u2014to date\\\\u2014 was crayon- ing a giant unicorn on the fireplace walls; my mother rewarded me with a stern reprimand to my buttocks.The blank wall in Taixi, Taiwan was no different.I was first tasked with creating a design for the wall on the fourth day of Taiwan-medical-student-retreat-hell in my sophomore year of high school. \\'Design a wall\\', my teammates said. \\'It\\'ll be easy\\', they said.Easy for you to say , I thought. All y\\'all are just a bunch of medical students that can\\'t draw.Nodding, I proceeded to blueprint my brain onto paper and presented it to my teammates. In the end, we settled for a mural of the sky, interspersed with tiny animals clutching balloons and a beanstalk as child-dreams. I chose the idea because it was cute. And because it was my idea.My teammates chose the idea because it was cute- and because it was my idea.The wall presented many challenges. We spent minutes removing advertisements, chalk-sketching, and painting polka-dots on the neighborhood stray.The wall created many dilemmas. We spent hours cleaning our spills, debating the consistency of hot pink versus pastel pink, and fanning our sunburned comrades with paint lids.The wall constructed many memories. We spent days stargazing at 2 AM from our motorcycles, chasing nonexistent rainclouds, and strengthening our bonds as a ragtag family. And when the wall-mural was finally complete, I remember the sense of satisfaction and happiness radiating from my companions as we whooped and cheered.Looking back, I realized that my obsession of walls fueled my creativity and desire to create something out of nothing, and that my abundance of crazy ideas could one day become reality. Never, in my wildest dreams, had I ever dreamed of painting an entire mural \\\\u2014by my own design\\\\u2014 in such an exotic area. Through sheer effort and will, I was able to implement my wishes and see them come to life before my very eyes.Fall 2016 8 I also came to understand how my creativity and penchant for design forced me to face my fears and act as a leader. Having always been the self-coined right-hand-man\\'s-right-hand who always gave ideas but never led the group, I assumed that Taixi would be no different. I was so very, very, wrong. My creativity forced me out of the box, and I learned how to reason and lead a group of my peers into completing a task.Mostly, though, I learned about me. Through the balloon-toting animals, I found my adolescence. Through the beanstalk, I found my perseverance. And through the wall itself, I found my persistence, tucked away under the sun\\'s burning gaze.The wall still stands, you know. Just three months ago, Mark visited Taixi and took pictures. The animals still laugh, the beanstalk still sways, and the love still burns.And I, too, still exist, believing that I have left a mark in the world.\"}, {\"index\": 39, \"new_personal_statement\": \"When I started debate, I didn\\'t think I\\'d become a leader. In fact, I only joined because there was no room for aharpist in the school orchestra. I was terrified of public speaking, so it was surprising that I enjoyed debate so much.My coach noticed my excitement and invited me to attend national tournaments normally reserved forupperclassmen. These competitions allowed me to spend time with my teammates in an atmosphere that wascompetitive, yet supportive. My teammates and competitors alike taught me to accept ideas that were different frommy own and that sometimes, the opposing perspective could be correct.As a sophomore, my coach believed I was experienced enough to lead the incoming freshmen and teach themimportant debate skills. I initially thought this would simply entail teaching them how to research, however, it turnedout there was much more to it. It was difficult instructing them on how to balance decorum with social engagement attournaments. I found that the best way to teach them was to model positive behaviors I hoped they\\'d acquire. Iwould come to tournaments on time and provide words of encouragement to other debaters, even if they were mycompetitors. I always packed extra supplies, brought homemade cookies, and stuck around to provide validation orcomfort. As a result, my teammates fondly began calling me \\'Team Mom.\\' Realizing they saw me as a motherfigure, I changed my role from an enabler to a leader. During national competitions, I would quiz team members withquestions and hold intense, challenging practice debates. At practice, I would highlight each team member\\'sstrengths, lead discussions that evaluated them, and then discuss how we could improve our weaknesses. Onceeach member understood how their assets uniquely contributed to the team, they improved, and I became a bettercaptain as well. My role in debate went from being a team member to a team captain.

Even when a fire erupts down the street, rendering the concert hall powerless. Even when the air conditioning fails in the scorching 110-degree heat of Northridge, California. Even when everything that could go wrong\\\\u2026 goes wrong.Throughout my classical training, I\\'ve always had a sense of consistency and forethought drilled into me. My fingers need to be precise to a 64th of an inch on my violin, my brain needs to calculate the interlocking pattern of polyrhythms, and my feet need to adjust miniscule degrees of incline on the pedals. So naturally, when the spotlights disappeared and the AC broke with a deafening whoosh, I froze. For a split second, all I could hear was the hitch of my breath and my arteries pulsating behind my ears. As I\\'ve come to learn, music is undoubtedly an art - a language that exists to resonate with a part of the soul untouchable with words. But music is also a science. A science that creates dissonance and resolution from pitch and frequency. A science that makes the progression to the tonic in the second movement of Rachmaninoff\\'s 2nd Concerto elicit such a tug on the heartstrings. To me, music comes to life when embracing the dichotomy of art and science. Liszt\\'s Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6 has four pages of intensely fast octaves that require exceptional stamina and strength. After six months of laborious work, I felt that I had finally found my music. Previously, piano had merely been the extracurricular that my parents wouldn\\'t let me quit. For the first time, I felt as if the piece was my own. I felt powerful and original. But in the summer of 2017, just as I was nearing peak performance, I crashed. My right pinky finger\\'s sagittal band ruptured, and I went from the brilliance of Liszt to barely being able to play hot cross buns. Doctors told me I would need an eight-week vacation from piano and while 10-year-old me would have jumped for joy, newly passionate me was devastated. That is, until I found that the orthopedic clinic was my heaven. I was enraptured by the machines, the equipment, and the interactions. The rush I experienced when playing the Liszt returned upon finding the dichotomy of art and science that I craved. My days were spent learning how to tape my hand, how to use the ultrasound, and how to mold casts. I fell in love with the prospect of becoming an orthopedic hand specialist because I could explore my curiosity about medicine while focusing on the mechanisms of a musician. And in the absence of a glaring spotlight, I realized that I never would have discovered such a passion without everything going wrong. Darkness shrouded the hall, with the audience in nervous restlessness and the sweltering heat creeping through the auditorium. All I could hear was an anxious wave of murmurs. An incapacitating fear washed over me, my mind disoriented after being jerked from the comfort of predictability I had previously relied on. But as I clutched my dress, a twinge of pain in my finger reminded me of how rewarding it is to persevere through the unpredictable. I inhaled deeply. I wasn\\'t in a play. There was no deus ex machina waiting backstage to make everything okay. I needed to do this myself. My fingers unclenched the mesh of my gown one by one, and I took my place. As the piano bench squeaked against the stage, the audience hushed in silent wonder, awaiting my cue. A small smile graced my lips; the drama had both me and my listeners on the edge of our seats. I raised my hands to the familiar black and white keys to play in the dark, humid concert hall. Because, ladies and gentlemen, the show must go on. \"}, {\"index\": 41, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Share an essay on any topic of your choice.

Deriving extraordinary beauty from ordinary moments gives me immense satisfaction; my secret artistry takes me to fantastical places, where the world is my canvas. But ingenuity without application is like strumming an imaginary guitar. It takes a medium \\\\u2013 a surface, instrument, or platform \\\\u2013 to express even the most imaginative ideas.Peering through the microscope, I observe the tiny worms squirming on agar and munching on bacteria. Wielding a platinum wire, I decontaminate my weapon with a Bunsen burner; my eyes settle on a single worm. Slowly advancing my worm-pick like a jaguar hunting its prey, I snatch it up and drown it in buffer, where its DNA will be collected for sequencing analysis. After spending weeks attempting to clone and integrate a novel plasmid, I smile at the culmination of my work: a beautiful string of A\\'s, T\\'s, C\\'s, and G\\'s perfectly complementing my original design. As I scribble the data in my lab notebook, I feel alive, knowing that I\\'ve made a meaningful contribution to the realm of worm neurobiology. It\\'s in the Worm Lab that I first experienced the unexpected artistry within research. In carefully designing experiments to explore the minute intricacies of worm biology, I create my own exhilarating adventure: every hypothesis I test resembles a stroke of my brush, ultimately resulting in an elegant masterpiece. The thrill of creating something no one has ever seen before captivates me more than anything else. The elementary school classroom buzzes with vibrant energy as students each grab a pencil, two dice, and a piece of paper. A young boy named Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.In the summer of 2019, I arrived on the campus as a curious and ambitious high school student. Armed with an exciting opportunity as an intern, I took a particular interest in a project creating uniquely gene-edited strains of C. elegans. In the following weeks, I sought to generate a new mutant strain for neuron-specific gene expression. However, I would soon face no shortage of challenges.In early July, I rubbed my eyes in disbelief. I expected a neat array of brightly colored bands corresponding to mutant DNA on my agarose gel, but all I saw were randomly scattered bands in the wrong positions. Feeling the frustration boiling in my blood, I agonized myself for ruining this critical experiment. Disheartened, I retreated to my desk, intent on finding a solution.With only three weeks left, I raced against the clock. Frequenting the hallways in search of guidance, I struck up conversations with lab technicians and postdocs alike. Each suggestion was carefully noted and tested the next day, hoping for success. At the next lab meeting, I presented my project and sought advice from my mentor and other labmates. With the whiteboard sprawled with progeny maps and experimental setups, we approached the problem from different angles and brainstormed new ideas.It was in the midst of a thoughtful discussion that I suddenly had my \\'Aha!\\' moment. Quickly, I put forth a new strategy to create more specificity in my polymerase chain reactions, which would increase the probability of a successful experiment. Invigorated by this new approach, I worked long weekends to carefully perform experiments until I was greeted with a definite indicator of my success: a beautiful string of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs perfectly complementing my original design. Beaming with pleasure, I took pride in finally resolving the issue and achieving this colorful sequence of DNA.My experience has taught me the importance of listening to diverse ideas in the collaborative environment of research. Embracing varied perspectives and different opinions can help me broaden my horizons and lead to future success.Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom. Growing up with both of my parents working in the pharmaceutical industry, I was the audience for frequent science-related talks during long car rides. Although most were far beyond my grasp, I was always curious about my dad\\'s work on metabolic mechanisms and drug development. The light exposure gained from these impromptu road lectures ignited a scientific spark inside me, inspiring me to learn more on my own. As I progressed through my high school science classes, one particular subject captured my curiosity: chemistry. Intrigued by the notion of minuscule atoms shaping all matter around me, I explored the countless real-world applications of chemistry through informational YouTube videos and rabbit holes of Wikipedia articles. Seeking opportunities outside of class to further my interest, I assembled a team of six students to compete in the Washington University Chemistry Tournament (WUCT) in St. Louis. Coordinating weekly meetings to practice problems and showcase lab demonstrations, I guided my teammates through cool experiments, carefully performing procedures ranging from pen ink chromatography to pickle juice titrations and iodine clocks. During the team round at WUCT, we worked on problem after problem, conjuring up reaction schemes and solving equilibrium systems together. Smiling fondly at the messy spread of papers representing the culmination of our hard work, I felt proud knowing our team\\'s collaborative efforts came to fruition.Chemistry inspires me to see everyday things differently \\\\u2013 pencil lead as intricately connected layers of graphite and Sprite as an acidic mixture of carbon dioxide and lemon-lime flavored water. It is a world full of limitless creative potential and hidden molecular wonders, and it is one I plan to explore much further in the future.What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?The elementary school classroom buzzes with vibrant energy as students each grab a pencil, two dice, and a piece of paper at the weekly math tutoring session. A young boy named Beyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admission to the University of California? While working full-time and caring for a family, my mom made countless sacrifices in her pursuit of a law degree. As a child, I constantly felt her absence and longed for \\'law school\\' to stop keeping her away from me. However, as I grew older, my mom began to describe to me her assignments - approaching cases from different angles, examining past rulings to support arguments, and so much more. Only then did I understand her undying commitment to education. I strove to follow in her footsteps, staying after class to ask burning questions in order to learn more. I had ignited a zeal for discovery, which would drive my educational approach for the next six years and beyond.Eager to cultivate this inner curiosity, I seized an opportunity to explore my cultural background through a six-week experience in Shanghai the summer after eighth grade. Immersed in a foreign environment on my own, I felt nervous and scared. At first, I was reluctant to connect with my host family, fearing I would make a bad impression with my Americanized-Chinese accent. However, recalling my mom\\'s journey from arriving in America barely speaking fluent English to graduating from law school, I became determined to practice my second language. Drawing upon years of weekend Chinese school and phone calls with my grandparents, I began to welcome opportunities to develop the authenticity of my accent. It soon became normal for me to strike up conversations with strangers on the subway. I let my curiosity flourish, tasting delicacies like stinky tofu at night markets and growing a profound appreciation for Tai Chi. I learned that by coming out of my shell, I could embrace the world around me and appreciate everything it has to offer.Today, my love of learning evokes the same unwavering dedication my mom carried throughout her journey. I am grateful to her for bestowing upon me a thirst for knowledge that fuels my ambition and embodies my academic philosophy. By refusing superficial explanations and simple solutions, I will continue exploring all aspects of my life and learning from everything I do.\"}, {\"index\": 42, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'The future belongs to those that believe in the beauty of their dreams.\\' Eleanor Roosevelt may havefirst said this, but it was my mom who instilled its meaning in me. Growing up in a single parent home,most of who I am came from my mom. She was the one who taught me to how to reach for the stars,and she was also the one who inspired me to go and grab them. While it\\'s true that we faced manychallenges as a single parent and her child, looking back I wouldn\\'t change anything, as those strugglesdefined who I am today.My parents were together until I was roughly six months old. I never knew my dad, and still haven\\'t evenmet him. After their split, my mom struggled to support us. I understood that we were poor from a youngage, despite my mother trying her best to make sure I wouldn\\'t feel the effects of it. Because of this, Iwas very conscious of what I was lucky enough to have, and I grew up with an appreciation foreverything we owned. I learned not to take even the most basic things for granted, and even today I feelI have a special appreciation for everything I own more so than many of my peers.The idea of not taking anything for granted carried over into my academic life. I began to appreciateeverything I had, not just tangible items. My mom never had to push me to do my school work, because Iunderstood that there were kids who didn\\'t even have the opportunity to go to school. I was aware thatcompared to my peers I was considered to be born into a less privileged life, but to me, it never felt thatway because I never believed that I was missing anything important that they had. I knew that therewere material goods I was missing because we were poor, but I knew that I had been very privileged tohave a family that loved me and the opportunity to make something of myself. My mom, once again,inspired me here, as she had given up her college education so that she could work more and spendtime with me, and as I grew up I felt the need to make sure that her sacrifice of her own academicsuccess would result in the success she desperately wanted me to have. As much as it might have beentempting for a young child to not pay attention in classes, I did everything I could to succeed, because Iknew that I was given a chance to do well that other people didn\\'t have, and I couldn\\'t take it for granted.Being poor, one may think my dreams might have been smaller and that I may have planned on going toa college with the cheapest sticker price or not going at all. But that was not the case. Because I pushedmyself in school so much, my mom saw my potential to do anything that I set my mind to. And becauseshe had sacrificed her dreams that she had had before me, she made sure that I knew following minewas very important. So I grew up in an environment where I was constantly reminded that I could bewhat I wanted to be, and that being happy by following your dreams was important. Suffice to say, whenmy mom left me a note in my lunchbox two years ago, a quote by the former first lady EleanorRoosevelt, it left an impression on me because it reflected what my mom had taught me growing up. Itsaid, \\'The future belongs to those that believe in the beauty of their dreams.\\' Two years ago, this meantdoing everything I could to set myself up for success and making most of the opportunities I had. Today,it has an added meaning to it: following my dream of pursuing science and impacting the world throughmy work.It was 3 a.m. The occasional car traveling down the interstate was the only indication of life outside mybedroom. I was perched on my bed, surrounded by the warm glow and soft hum of my laptop. I knew Ishould\\'ve been sleeping, but the excitement and wonder of my newest passion were providing me withendless energy. I listened to the same song for hours, trying to perfect my recent creation. I haddiscovered that I absolutely loved making arrangements of popular or well-known songs for percussionensembles and marching bands.Music had been a part of my life for a very long time, but I had never explored it in this way. That nightwas the first time I had ever tried my hand at physically sitting down and writing music. I wrote out themain melody of the song entirely by ear, and from there I taught myself how to make the newarrangement interesting and unique. I thought, and still do think, that it was incredibly cool and that itsounded amazing. Even from the very beginning though, I was most curious about how my arranging ofmusic was actually working. I knew what harmonies were, but why did they sound good? I had beendoing it all by ear, but was there a way to determine harmonies by using math within music? I hadaccidentally stumbled across music theory, simply because I thought that the world could stand to hearthe Legend of Zelda theme song played by a percussion group.Curious, during this summer I decided to do some research and see if there was a really a way to writemusic based on math. I was incredibly shocked to learn that math was used for almost any composing amusician wanted to do; I was even more surprised when I found out just how complicated arranging orwriting can be. This new information excited me; math and music together? Two of my favorite things inthe world were combined.To continue to explore this curiosity, I continued making many arrangements of songs, and taught myselfhow to make arrangements for a marching band. However, one of the more prominent things I\\'ve doneto pursue this interest was to enroll in the music theory class that my school offers. I have to say I\\'vebeen a bit impatient, and have taken it upon myself to go slightly ahead of the classes pace in order tolearn about twelve-tone music. I haven\\'t gotten very far along, but I absolutely love it. It combines thebeauty of music with the puzzle solving of math, and spending time learning about it both on my own andin class makes me want to continue to learn about music theory even more in college, whether that beas an elective class or even independently.\"}, {\"index\": 43, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I walk in and take a deep breath, catching the smell of roasted coffee beans as it tickles my nose. With no time wasted, I beeline towards the queue for coffee that has formed in front of my eyes. Soon it\\'s my turn to order. Immediately, I realize something is different\\\\u2014the barista at the cash register is unfamiliar. I know all the baristas here, so who is this man? I sneak a peek at the nametag: Peter. His swoopy hair and dark eyebags peeking out underneath his glasses seem to indicate he is a first-year college student juggling work with school. His unrecognizable face strikes a curiosity within me, causing me to blurt out, \\'Are you new here?\\'Taken aback by my use of mouth for something other than ordering coffee, his bewilderment turns into appreciation. As we converse, I learn Peter\\'s story: a recent college grad with aspirations to become a psychologist. Our conversation is cut short by the lengthening queue; I order and am presentednot only with a cup of joe but a newfound acquaintance.Having grown up a Seattleite, the coffee shop culture is unavoidable. I am attracted to the jazzy music, the light chit chatter, the warm atmosphere. Yet what\\'s truly fascinating is the people. People of all walks of life descend on the coffee shop to inhale their daily caffeine. They model a spectrum of maturity, boundless opportunities, and limitless stories. I see a tall man tersely speaking into a phone, his leg anxiously shaking. Maybe he got into a fight with his significant other, or is in the middle of a call with an unhappy boss. I spot a woman sitting, headphones in, laptop out, consulting a notebook stock full of furious scribbling. Perhaps a freelance journalist writing a piece about an unsolved murder mystery? Or possibly a scientist analyzing data from her most recent experiment?I indulge on the endless possibilities, surfing between the lines of fiction and reality. I close my eyes and dream of a musical number, using the characters of the coffee shop as the stars of the show. The sitting woman and the tall man sing an emotional ballade while I occupy space as a background dancer\\\\u2014a scene far from realism yet straight out of an episode of Glee. I open my eyes and see the tall man still talking on his phone, sitting woman still consulting her notes. Reality resumes.To me, the coffee shop is larger than life. Not only does it grant patrons the energy to function in the mornings, but connects people to people\\\\u2014more importantly, connects people to stories, real or conceived, that give birth to countless inspirations.In essence, I am magnetized by stories. The coffee shop nurtures this interest, drawing me to activities where storytelling is the pinnacle. I undertake awkward social situations with the purpose of learning unique stories about people who would otherwise just be strangers; I play piano and violin because the music is open to interpretation, giving me a platform to tell a story; I enjoy teaching kids because their childlike wonder lets mine come out and play. Above all, I have an affinity for stories because I wish for my own life to be a well-crafted story: taking a wandering path of its own with a calculated resolve\\\\u2014the perfect mix of freedom with control. Everything that I do, I do to propel my search for a story unique to me. And when my curiosity reaches a dead end, I instinctively wander back to the coffee shop to find directions for inspiration. I queue for coffee and wait as the infinitude of possibilities inevitably unfurl before me. I catch sight of Peter, exchanging a smile and wave. No longer a stranger, Peter has become another character in the cast of the coffee shop, handing me his story to fuel my imagination.I didn\\'t realize how much the mere presence of a person can be comforting until I became a trained active listener on 7 Cups of Tea, an online counseling platform. Being an active listener means that I have the ability to chat with people seeking counseling by purely helping them articulate their feelings, not by giving them advice. Being an active listener is not about treating diagnoses, but instead about giving people an outlet to talk about their worries and fears with no strings attached.Active listening as a \\'hobby\\' didn\\'t feel real early on, but soon I developed the understanding that the people I talk to are not characters in a video game-they\\'re real people, and every word I type matters. I remember the first person I talked to was a guy from Scotland. He wanted to join the army to fight for his country, to feel like his life had surmounted to something. It broke my heart to see the emotions he was dealing with, and I therefore made it my goal to help every person I talk to on the website forget about the darkness in their lives for just a few minutes a day. I would listen to what they wanted to talk about, comfort them, support them, encourage them, and then talk to them about things beyond the dimensions of their mental health. I would crack jokes, ask about their hobbies and passions, request music recommendations. Even though I was certified only to listen, I wanted them to feel like somebody truly cared about them. I failed to comprehend the full extent of what I was doing until a few weeks after I became an active listener. I had chatted with the guy from Scotland intermittently since, and the next time he messaged me, he was thanking me for listening to him. He told me that he always looked forward to talking to me because it made him feel a little better every day. It has never brought me more happiness to know I have the potential make a difference in somebody\\'s life. 8:40 AM\\\\u2014time for class. For the last time, I walk into my classroom full of tiny, screeching third graders. I had spent the previous two weeks teaching obnoxious little kids. Their nonstop mischievousness had me begging on my knees at the end of each day, pleading to somebody, anybody, that I would not have to spend another day dealing with devil children. Sure, I had shared many fun memories with them, but part of me was grateful I would not see these students ever again. So why did I feel a twisted knot of regret creeping up from the depths of my stomach? Whilst trying to grasp this feeling\\'s meaning, I am approached by one of my kids. She wears a bright smile, yet her eyes are dark and dismal. \\'Is today the last day?\\' she asks, eyebrows furrowed. I nod. \\'And then you\\'re gone forever?\\' It was rhetorical, but I nod anyways. Her arms cling onto mine. \\'Don\\'t leave. Why can\\'t you stay?\\' She burrows her head into my shoulder to hide the tears. She looks up at me, smile now replaced with a frown, eyes now clouded with water. I reach down to wipe away her tears, attempting a laugh and telling her to smile. The twist in my stomach expands until the feeling is unavoidable. I can feel tears welling up in my own eyes. Why am I crying? \\'You can\\'t tell me not to cry if you\\'re crying,\\' she teases, wiping away my tears as I had done for her. She pauses to unclasp a bracelet from her wrist, pressing it into my hands. She looks into my eyes with conviction, whispering, \\'Don\\'t forget me.\\' Don\\'t forget me. Was she scared I would forget her, as if she meant nothing to me? To her, I was a role model. Yet what was she to me? All my life I had been my own best friend, enveloped in a world of apathy. As I cried with her bracelet in my hands, I wanted to stop feeling unattached towards people who deserve my love. I wanted to care again. What I lacked in my life was an acknowledgement of the cycle of trust and affection. Having been an adamant believer that I, alone, shaped myself into the person I am, I built a castle with walls that symbolized dependency as a liability. I vowed to be there for my loved ones in times of hardship, yet I closed the doors on the people who wanted to be there for me as I had been for them. Living in that expansive castle unaccompanied, I pretended the concept that people shape other people was not a necessity. However, well-worn structures require renovation, and my castle is no different. By gradually deconstructing my walls and installing a sturdy drawbridge, my newly improved castle makes sure that dependency can coexist with independency.Twirling the bracelet that sits snugly on my wrist, I smile in remembrance. \\'I could never forget you.\\'Music is my creative outlet. Playing music, listening to music, analyzing music, you name it-every aspect of music fosters my creative expression. There is something so beautiful about music that transcends time and space, unlocking an infinitude of possibilities for inspiration. I started playing music when I was seven. What I love about playing music is that it is open to interpretation, giving me a platform to tell a story. The plain notes come to life in whichever way I decide to push and pull them, singing emotions that words cannot place. I started listening to an expansive amount of music when I was twelve. Now, you can turn on my phone at any given moment and catch me listening to dance or classical music, R&B, hip hop, heavy rock, or jazz. I listen to a broad range of music because each music genre helps me tap into particular feelings I may not be able to experience on a daily basis through my own accord. There\\'s just something so stimulating about listening to music that spurs on my creativity, motivating me to unpack my emotions through written stories or drawn artworks. I started analyzing music quite recently, when I was sixteen. I began mainly because my piano teacher told me I needed to understand music theory better to assist in the ease of memorizing music. However, analyzing music composition has helped not only improve my memorization skills, but aided in my recognition of how other musicians channel their creative side through chord succession and musical inflections, subsequently inspiring me on my own creative endeavors. I dabbled into composing my own music in recent months, though I still have much to learn.Without music, my life would be incomplete. Music grants me the ability to discover the power of creativity, helping me craft stories that encapsulate my state of mind.As usual, my family and I were watching NBC Nightly News while eating dinner. I was contentedly chewing my food, when suddenly I heard Lester Holt declaring the death of Oliver Sacks, world-renowned neurologist. I stopped mid-chew. Although I knew nothing about neurology at the time, anything brain-related is captivating to me, so I made a mental note to search him up later and resumed my chewing.What unraveled that evening was an all-nighter dedicated to reading works by Oliver Sacks. I finished Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat, and, by the end of the week, devoured two more of his books. Nonfiction had never fascinated me as much as this; I felt inexplicably drawn to neuroscience as a career.If reading Sacks\\' books is a catalyst, many reactants-school, family, personal interest-were involved in the reaction itself to result in a product. My school may not offer neuroscience-related courses, but I got as close as I could; in biology we worked with Artificial Neural Networks, while psychology reinforced my love for the mind. My mom is a psychology major; her incessant interest with human behavior inspired mine. My grandfather has Alzheimer\\'s; his incurable memory degeneration makes me wonder about the immense power of the brain. My interests led me to read articles, books in my free time; I now understand how neuroscience can be applied to technology (such as that being developed by Neuralink) and why it is a very important up-and-coming field of science.Sure, interest doesn\\'t reflect reality. I haven\\'t done much academically to go in depth into neuroscience and psychology. I haven\\'t worked in a lab, haven\\'t landed internships at a medical research center. However, what I do have is curiosity and perseverance. Lab skills can easily be learned. Passion cannot. \\'I\\'m going to die before I finish college.\\' I used to tell myself this all the time. In my depression and anxiety-ridden brain, this recurring thought became an excuse to slack off. I did the bare minimum required to do well in school, I stopped practicing piano and violin as often because I didn\\'t think it was important. I grew uninterested in learning, seeing no benefits of knowledge. I shut myself off from my friends and family, existing in a world where I was my own best friend. I forgot what it was like to be happy. I forgot what it was like to care about anything.It wasn\\'t that I didn\\'t want to get better-I just didn\\'t know how. I tried meditating, coloring, and freewriting, but my options were limited, as I didn\\'t want to burden anyone else with my troubles, adamantly believing I could survive through this alone. Even though I vowed to be there for my friends and family in times of hardship, I closed the doors on the people who wanted to be there for me as I had been for them. What I refused to acknowledge in my life was a cycle of trust and love. Then, in my junior year, I met a group of people that changed my emotional outlook. Their never-ending encouragement and acceptance gave me the strength to take control of how I live my life. Around them, I lost my anxiety and depression. I felt alive, I felt free. They helped me understand what it is like to live a life of kindness and laughter-of what it is like to trust and love. Soon, I began to look forward to waking up in the morning. I stopped viewing my past as a mistake and instead as a motivator. I stopped excusing my future as obsolete and instead as aspiration-filled. I openly express my appreciation for friends and family and prioritize the time we spend together. Learning makes me excited, music has become my creative experiment.Truly, I am happy.\"}, {\"index\": 44, \"new_personal_statement\": \"A wooden house wider than taller stood in front of me. With run-down steps and a slanted sign-U-Pick Cherries-I almost laughed out loud. This was what we had driven five hours for? I sat down on a ladder under the shade, reveling in the breeze and watching my mom approach me with a basket of cherries resting against her hip. \\'Just try one.\\'Mouth poised to protest, I then decided I didn\\'t want to deal with fifteen minutes of her pestering me. Reluctantly, I opened my mouth. Maybe it was the scorching heat, for much to my surprise, I immensely enjoyed the refreshing cherries I so intensely despised before. I had been determined to hate and adhere to my previous opinion of them-irritating my mom would have been a pleasant bonus too. It\\'s that mentality that I\\'ve tried to erode throughout the years. My mind builds up walls, designating what interests I can and cannot like, the activities I can and cannot do, and the passions I can and cannot pursue. Regretfully, I imagine the thousands of cherries I missed out on eating the first eight years of my life simply because I tried them two times before and determined I would never change my mind. It amuses me that now, I anticipate summer farmers\\' markets where I can buy my weekly indulgence: twenty pounds of cherries. Of course, most endeavors are not so surprising or rewarding. But I don\\'t know until I try. After that eye-opening experience, I\\'ve made it my mission to be more willing to take risks. Some cherries aren\\'t quite as easy to digest, however. Almost six years later from that trip to Yakima, I walked into my sales and marketing class as a nervous and naive freshman. As I chose events for DECA, an international business competition, flabbergasting interactions with my crush flashed through my mind. Without hesitation, my pen glided over \\'improvisation\\' and \\'roleplay\\' as I scoured for events with more preparation instead. I unconsciously limited myself, never realizing that I was simply ruining my own opportunity for growth. I passed two years of avoiding John (those beautiful blue eyes...) and those intimidating events, but when junior year arrived, my pen hovered over the roleplays. I almost dismissed them again, envisioning the judge\\'s pained expression as I struggled with words for fifteen minutes. But I shrugging the hesitation and negativity out of my head. I was doing this for myself. I wanted to take a chance, and so what if I failed? So what if the judge internally laughed? I circled a roleplay.A medal now rests on my bedpost, reminding me every day of how far I have come. Placing second at state was nothing compared to the sense of self-accomplishment I felt standing onstage, though. Once I realized what I was working for, winning didn\\'t matter. Rather, I had a chance to prove to myself that I could accomplish something I never thought I could. The event managers provide the prompt just thirty minutes before the roleplay. That preparation time is full of scribbling phrases on paper, pencil tapping, and calming my nerves. But I had preparation beyond that simple half hour. Ever since that experience at the cherry farm, I have taken risks, challenged my own mentality, and grown as a human. Though it took me time, I have gradually recognized the value of remaining openminded. Now, every day I find even the smallest of ways to venture into unexplored territory. I mix up my orders at The Cheesecake Factory, though I know I can never go wrong with the salted caramel cheesecake. I run different trails each weekend, discovering hidden spots of sunshine and meadows. I\\'m always on the hunt for cherries now-small, sweet surprises that refresh my outlook on life and remind me to step out of my comfort zone. And when I find them, I bite.

After six weeks of debugging, despair, and dedication, I finally emerged with a JavaSwing application. Devising a management system that our board used for the rest of the year, and continues to use, immensely satisfied me. I marveled at my own ability and power: how did I produce a practical product just from tapping several keys? The hours of frustration creating pie charts with user input and account pages for different-access users faded away as I watched the other board members play around with my application\\\\u2014an intense, giddy excitement bubbled in my stomach, the same intrigue that I had felt so many years before.

On the bus ride home, every day I read articles about new trends in the tech world. Fueled by a curiosity inherent to engineers, I took to learning more about Big Data and artificial intelligence. I began to recognize surrounding issues, an awareness that also carries engineers far; my mind wondered about solutions to improving technology-related issues, such as city traffic apps and vertigo from reading in moving vehicles. In a continually evolving world, I am motivated to contribute knowing that I can actively shape the future through each line of code, from reinventing routine actions to devising new ways to experience and appreciate life\\'s blessings, such as the joys of sisterhood that that fateful iPad granted me so many years ago.My sister\\'s finger precariously floated above the iPad\\'s send button, poised to email our friends my \\'affectionate\\' family nickname: Jujube.

After six weeks of debugging, despair, and dedication, I finally emerged with a JavaSwing application for Cultural Diversity Club. Devising a management system that our board used for the rest of the year, and continues to use, immensely satisfied me, reinforcing computer science as my future calling. But that passion for impact was amplified when I walked through the glass doors of Expedia, home of my summer apprenticeship. There, features such as recommendations and voice assistants came to life, all intending to streamline users\\' experiences and provide them with the best service possible. Similar to my in-class project, I applied the concepts and problem-solving mindset I had learned to real-life applications, presenting me with a thrilling sense of accomplishment and a renewed excitement for coding.How we travel, learn, and live changes constantly. I want to be the leader of that change. During my time at Expedia, one of the most significant issues discussed was the growth of artificial intelligence and the need to understand its full, often unforeseen implications. Artificial intelligence is only one among many other current buzzwords, such as big data and the Internet of Things. Participating in HackIllinois and attending Reflections | Projections are exciting ways for me to develop my exposure to and experience in these various facets of computer science. Delving deeper through ACM\\'s special interest groups such as SIGAI would allow me to graduate with the knowledge to become an architect of technological growth. I hope to become a software developer or machine learning engineer to make a tangible difference in people\\'s lives. By majoring in computer science at UIUC, I can grow the ability to actively shape the future through each line of code, from reinventing routine actions, such as communication, to devising new ways to experience and appreciate life\\'s blessings, such as the joys of sisterhood that that fateful iPad had granted me so many years ago.I went from being an outspoken cherry-hater to a wholehearted cherry-lover. When May flowers begin to bloom, I eagerly rush to farmers\\' markets and collect my weekly indulgence: twenty pounds of cherries. Though I first abandoned my hatred of the fruit at eight years old, I still marvel at the extent of my cherry obsession. More than just a delectable, refreshing snack, they represent the beauty of surprises. My life has been a continual journey of self-discovery and self-growth, as I constantly demolish the walls my mind has unconsciously constructed to fully explore new interests and passions. Almost four years ago, I nervously walked into my freshman business class. Flabbergasting interactions with my crush flashed through my mind. Without hesitation, my pen glided over \\'improvisation\\' and \\'roleplay\\' as I scoured for DECA competition events with more preparation instead. I passed two years avoiding John (those beautiful blue eyes...) and intimidating improvisation events, but when junior year arrived, my pen impulsively circled a roleplay. For the first time, I felt no pressure for my efforts to be validated, believing that I\\'d probably fail anyway. Yet every day, I unconsciously and actively sought out interactions with strangers, from baristas to lifeguards at my local YMCA, training myself to respond quickly and reveling in a newfound confidence from mere small talk. A medal now rests on my bedpost, reminding me of how much I\\'ve grown from the reserved girl I previously was. Once I realized what I was working for, winning didn\\'t matter. Rather, I had a chance to prove to myself that I could accomplish something I never thought I could. I still stumble over my words, but I\\'ve adopted a positive attitude towards speaking and risks in general. I might just say hello to John the next time I see him\\\\u2026 The event managers provide the prompt just thirty minutes before the roleplay, a period of scribbling phrases and pencil tapping. But I had preparation beyond that half hour. Ever since my experience at the cherry farm, I have challenged my own mentality and gradually recognized the value of remaining open-minded. Now, every day I find even the smallest of ways to venture into unexplored territory. I mix up my orders at The Cheesecake Factory, though I know I can never go wrong with the salted caramel cheesecake. I run different trails each weekend, discovering hidden spots of sunlight and water. I\\'m always on the hunt for cherries now\\\\u2014small, sweet surprises that refresh my outlook on life and remind me to step out of my comfort zone. And when I find them, I bite. My breath catches in my throat\\\\u2014with wind swirling around me and fog hovering over the woods, my tiny world seems so different 4,000 feet up above. Glancing around, I recognize other hikers\\' similar wonderstruck reactions. We all seek both the exhilarating thrill and calming effect of a nature escape from our bubbles below.Never have I felt so small and the world so big. And I\\'m okay with that\\\\u2014at this moment. When I finally hike back down, the next week awaits me. But I know the destination is worth it, and this time, the world is at my feet.\"}, {\"index\": 45, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Olalla? One thing\\'s for sure - I bet you can\\'t find that name on one of those clunky keychains at a gift shop\\'. Itwas my first day on the job at the Capitol. My mentor had hesitated a moment upon hearing my name, but with hisoffhand comment and a hearty handshake, he put me at ease. You see, DC lobbyists have this crazy ability ofconnecting with anybody: the falafel truck man, the senator of the Great State of Wisconsin, or a lanky, flustered,sixteen-year old intern like me.My name is Olalla and I\\'m used to the inquisitive looks and questions it gets. Olalla is that name on the attendancesheet that makes teachers on the First Day of School lower their spectacles, mouth silently, and valiantly attempt:\\'Oh-lah-lah?\\' So I\\'m Olivia at Starbucks, for practicality\\'s sake.All my life I\\'ve wondered what it would be like if I had just any other name - something common, inconspicuous,readable. But then it would not reflect who I am. My name reveals my family\\'s expat tale - the move from Madrid toNew Jersey, my English learned through morning daycare and Lilo and Stitch at night. It explains the clumsysnowmen and poorly carved pumpkins at our curb. In the school cafeteria, my name helped me to justify theperplexing food in my lunchbox.Olalla is about Spanish lullabies and prayers, but English books and slang. The daily shuffle between domesticand academic. It\\'s a preschooler educating her parents about the enigmas of American suburbia. It\\'s about Paellafor Thanksgiving. In a way, it\\'s a paradox: Olalla is a link to my roots and my alienation, all at once.At my internship, I tried to explain this \\'Spanglish\\' lifestyle - just as I had always done in school. It surprised methat my mentor didn\\'t find it exceptional. Instead, he saw it as a source of common ground. \\'Olalla, here in DC weare all about proofreading emails, Politico issues, business cards, and a whole lot of espresso. But whenever welobbyists call home\\' he pointed out, \\'we always slip into our local drawl. You live in two worlds, but don\\'t we all?\\'It wasn\\'t until the day I became an American citizen that I fully understood - one of those crisp, breezy morningshovering on the brink of Spring. At the Immigration Office, a projector displayed breathtaking photographs ofNational Parks with a soundtrack of festive, patriotic songs. People of every background, age, and race bustledabout. We waited excitedly for a pre-recorded welcome from Barack and Michelle.One woman arrived with a granddaughter as her translator. When her name was called for her certificate ofcitizenship, her mouth\\'s wrinkles turned up in a gap-toothed grin. She wore a traditional Guatemalan dress thatswayed on her skinny build and clutched an American flag - fluttering in her calloused hands. The red, white, andblue of the banner and the lively hues of her skirts were somehow harmonious.Right then I saw myself in that woman and in those surrounding me - a beaming man with an unpronounceableSerbian surname, a girl buzzing in a blend of Japanese and English at the sight of her certificate, a boy dressedproudly for the occasion in a crimson turban and blue loafers.We, the soon-to-be-Americans, couldn\\'t have been more different. Still, there was a collective sense of unity. Wewere linked by our dual lives, intriguing traditions, mixed languages, and - of course - our exotic names.\\'Olalla!\\'I lifted my hand for the oath as my name was called. The skin of my arms went on end at the sound of America theBeautiful.

Everyone stares at me as I try to comprehend her question.\\'I...I don\\'t know,\\' I manage to answer. Giggles slip out from my peers. My face immediately reddens. \\'Mrs. Schiffer, I think Brandon may have meant \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Excuse me\\'.\\' Turning around, I spot my saving grace, a lady who\\'s watched this whole affair. \\'Can I borrow Brandon for a minute?\\'As I\\'m led to the side, I meekly cast a few glances at the lady.\\'Brandon, there\\'s no need to be worried. My name is Ms. Liang, one of the school\\'s ESL teachers. I\\'ve been observing you for the past few weeks and I couldn\\'t help but notice your...troubles with English. Is everything alright?\\' I start to tear up as I perfectly understand her stream of Mandarin. Finally, someone who can help me!So I tell her everything: how it\\'s been a year since I came to America, how Mandarin is the predominant language spoken at home, and how minimal my interactions were with other kids. I was the kid who sat alone at lunch, the kid who worked alone in class, the kid who played alone at recess. These factors contributed to a seemingly insurmountable language barrier.After I finish telling her the inhibitions of my development as a student, she pats my shoulder and promises to help guide my assimilation into this vastly different culture. Two days later, I\\'m sitting in her class. Over weekday sessions, my grammar, spelling, and pronunciation of English words steadily improved to the point that I was comfortable speaking. Nonetheless, it was on Saturdays that Ms. Liang made the most impact. From a young age, I knew that people rested on weekends, but here was a teacher who dedicated her own time to improving my grasp of the English language. She took the extra steps to provide me free 1-on-1 tutoring, a clear sign that she cared more about her students\\' success than anything else. It resonated with me so much that I considered her as a mentor, someone who had helped me gain confidence. I promised myself that if I were to ever become proficient in English, I would pay it forward as Ms. Liang had done for me.Nowadays, instead of being tutored, I spend my Saturdays taking the responsibility of being a volunteer tutor. I especially look forward to my meetings with Jorge, a first-grader who recently moved here from Central America. Armed with the Spanish I\\'ve learned in four years of high school, I hope to assist Jorge\\'s transition into American culture.During our first meeting, I could understand Jorge little more than he could understand me. \\'Jorge! C\\\\u00f3mo est\\\\u00e0s?\\' became my customary greeting. But as we met more frequently, his knowledge of English allowed him to alternate between English and Spanish. He became more animated and lively, with a mischievous sparkle in his eyes and a contagious smile. At the end of each session, Jorge gives me his signature handshake farewell. The Saturday before Christmas, however, he surprised me with a bear hug, an action that spoke volumes more than any words ever could. My eyes became unusually watery. The circle of his hug brought me back to my early, confused days in this country. Like Jorge, I was lost and alone, divided from my peers by the seemingly unconquerable wall of a language barrier. Like with Jorge, it did not take much to tear down that wall\\\\u2014just a simple greeting from a kind woman to establish familiar territory. In the turbulent times our country is facing, I cannot help but think that building more connections and tearing down the walls of difference are wonderful ways we can all live comfortably together.\"}, {\"index\": 47, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I sprinted up and down the pitch, scratches littered on my arms and legs. If it were up to me, I would have lived on that soccer pitch but when I heard the words every 8 year old boy fears the most-\\'TARAN JITENDRA PANJABI!\\', I knew it was time to head home. At my desk, the fever of the football field found expression in a tattered Mathematics textbook.Math class had always been a comforting experience. Our teacher would assign both the homework and class assignment at the start of class so I would go ahead and finish both. My prime factorization was flawless, algebraic long division precise, and my eyes would glaze over, staring at the school clock as I waited, my work completed. I was told to relax or to complete my homework for some other class. Sadness spread across my face as I was not being heard - I didn\\'t want to do other work in Math class. I wanted to do Math in other classes.I often sat in the school library, surrounded by friends who were reading the latest Harry Potter while I read \\'The Joy of Pi\\'. Unlike most words in the English language which had only a few meanings, Pi could be defined in over 50 ways. Intrigued, I stashed a flashlight and book under my bedsheets and explored the realms of \\'Fermat\\'s Last Theorem\\' or \\'The Number Devil\\'.Exploring deceptively simple topics like \\'Types of Infinities\\' or \\'Hilbert\\'s Hotel\\' challenged me with the task of filling infinite buses of infinite people into a hotel with infinite rooms. However, I was told to reduce the time spent on Math and study other subjects because my Math grades were \\'fine\\'. I could not help myself, though, and as my pen wandered through the paths of different theorems, my confused thoughts blossomed into a few lines of misplaced symbols and numbers. School did not ask me the questions I wanted to be asked, nor did it help me puzzle through the ones I concocted, so I started looking for other avenues.A perfect opportunity arose as I came across the \\'Millennium Problems\\'. Don\\'t get me wrong - 14 year old me didn\\'t expect to solve questions the world\\'s best mathematicians struggled with. My precociousness, however, was unbridled, and I wondered - P versus NP is truly mind boggling. Verifying answers will always be easier than obtaining them but why had this problem arisen? Were methods used to take on complexity-based cryptography not applicable? I bent over the paper, armed with the energy of my Eureka moment, heart racing as I sprinted through the pages of my notebook to where I thought the use of one-way functions might have potential but as one would expect, no such luck. Motivated by this surge of energy, I launched into a quest of my own in an attempt to mix drinkable water bubbles with the Banach Tarski Paradox to split one spherical object into an infinitely small particle and use rotation to create a new water bubble. The potential, in Math, to solve world crises astonished me - sadly this was only theoretical but nevertheless, the spark had been lit.Propelled by my vigor for mathematical discovery, I landed in Vienna for the ISMTF Competition. As I spent long nights, discussing topics like \\'Computability Theory\\' where perspective and logical analysis were more important than advanced formulae, with people as boundlessly excited as I, the drive to pursue this passion grew deep seated. The little boy within me refused to be content with the title \\'World Topper in Mathematics\\' and the child who would covertly read Mathematics under the sheets returned.My whiteboard - the football pitch. My hand - the player. I was now the same 8 year old boy free to explore, free of the worry of hearing the words every 8 year old boy fears most.Additional InformationI have always been passionate about Mathematics, and I had a strong inclination towards pursuing Further Mathematics in the A Levels even though my school did not offer it as a subject taught in school. To further this interest, I have started studying Linear Algebra at Johns Hopkins\\' Center for Talented Youth. I am currently midway through the course averaging a score of 84%.I have been closely associated with a non-denominational service organization called The Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organization whichhas over 2 million members since I was five. I helped build a volunteer suggestion software for them which was used on a data set of over 500,000 members. It helped yield a 30% increase in participation with greater motivation towards the specific community service projects.The software uses \\'K means clustering\\' to cluster groups of people to get volunteers who are most likely to participate in particular events.\"}, {\"index\": 48, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Will come back to this\"}, {\"index\": 49, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Caitlin, for our debate, could you choreograph a spoken word dance expressing why the United States shouldn\\'t employ a unilateral assault against terrorism?\\' I remembered rallying up the class with the Charleston, playing swing music to enhance our discussion about the culture of the 1920s Harlem Renaissance, so naturally, I blurted, \\'Of course!\\'. As I walked to my next class, the gravity and relevance of the debate issue dawned on me. Panicking, I wondered: how would I effectively display the nuances of terrorism through contemporary dance? I found my answer in \\'artivism\\', this portmanteau word combining art and activism, using the arts to revolutionize. Personally, dance as creative expression was far from foreign, but artivism was unknown. Beyond simply dancing, artivism meant physically and emotionally embodying the complications of terrorism, as the movement itself reflects the weight of these pressing issues. At that debate, I performed the contemporary piece as my opening statement, but this was merely a discovery that has allowed me to use dance to actively enact social change. On that day, everything that I had consciously ruminated on and practiced -- the heavy landings, the tense upper body -- were properly executed. The extended tendus and port de bras were elegant, but true artivism was something that I had yet to conquer.The proper execution of an arabesque or saut de chat, the technical complexities of a pirouette, the full extension of a tendu, no longer sufficed. Instead, the implications beneath the individual phrases in a spoken word poem, the issues regarding racial stereotypes and immigration controversies, were the true motivations behind the movement. Instead of landing softly and gracefully from grande jetes, now engrained into my muscle memory, I fell with immense weight to demonstrate the fear of women wearing burkas as they passed airport security. But the true difficulty lay beneath the movements themselves. Even before trying to ascertain how to portray these stereotypes and socioeconomic issues through dance, I needed to understand what they meant to me. Days after the Manchester attack, I was teaching a jazz routine to local elementary school children in a downtown community. I caught glimpses of one girl, Seetha, in the back corner with her head down and hands folded in her lap. The more I attempted to approach her, the more she closed off. I finally reached her, placing my hand on her shoulder, and a small tear streamed down her cheek. This third grade child, torn from her idyllic perception of the world, now felt personally condemned by her classmates for an attack with motives that she couldn\\'t begin to comprehend. \\'Why do they treat me this way?\\' she murmured under her breath. At that moment, I didn\\'t know what to do or say, but I stayed with Seetha, my hand still resting on her shoulder. The other children began noticing Seetha\\'s pain and saved me from my embarrassment; I took a step back, watching them surround her with positive words and tight hugs. I played a lyrical song as they began to dance freely rather than perform technical steps. Her tears dissipated and genuine laughter emerged -- dance had temporarily freed her from these burdens. It didn\\'t matter that she barely knew the others; dance made her feel connected and wanted.As the children rallied together, I found dance\\'s power as an equalizer, diminishing stereotypes and fostering cohesion among individuals from a multitude of backgrounds. This was my first introduction to a deeper comprehension of artivism; Seetha was my first step to empathy. The weighty landings of the grande jetes, the tense upper body in the d\\\\u00e9velopp\\\\u00e9s, were now real. I understood what that weight meant, I saw the fear evoked. The arts are a powerful way of addressing complex societal issues, and my growing understanding that art is just as potent as words assures me that I can be an effective activist through dance.While I was reading to the children in the local elementary school, introducing them to new characters and unknown realms, they gathered as close as possible, their bright eyes exuding an insatiable and genuine curiosity, their faces glued to the vibrant illustrations. I caught the gentle smile of Ms. Vicario, the OC Educational Arts Academy\\'s volunteer coordinator, who was sitting in the furthest corner of the cafeteria, and immediately felt belonging. Walking distance from my school, this elementary school was my home on Friday afternoons.At OCSA, I found a niche in the mentors and the advocates who incited my passion for hands-on civic engagement. It was listening to Ms. Vicario read imaginative, student written stories inspired by the books read to them, that gave me joy. It was working alongside Jim Kolb, the director of my dance conservatory, who persistently scooped gelato while firmly gripping a crutch in his other hand, fundraising to support the arts education I greatly cherish, that inspired me to become an active member of society.I vowed to give these elementary school kids everything that I had received from my mentors. The same students that were previously in my Camp OCSA arts enrichment classes, first learning beginner pirouettes and battements, were now maximizing their opportunities at this school, innovating and creating their own stories. Giving these children the chance to succeed not only brings me immense satisfaction, but it also enables me the privilege of continuing this tradition of mentorship that OCSA has fostered. I cherished the mentors who sacrificed to provide me with ample opportunities, and I hoped to be that mentor for the next generation of artists and storytellers. As the number of Friday afternoons began to accumulate, I felt belonging with these students, and I had this responsibility to represent their needs. Whether it be through reading stories, teaching dance classes, or leading team-building exercises, my own actions were directly benefitting these students. The privilege of watching these students better themselves as artists, students, and people has motivated me to become an active influencer. Inefficiencies and wasted time are inherent in almost all systems that we encounter. This past summer, I interned at the Veterans Affairs Hospital and discovered that these inefficient systems not only refer to mechanical processes, but also human actions and everyday life. From the first day I began the internship, all the interns collectively met in a conference group as we began to discuss possible strategies to reduce some of the inefficiencies present in the radiology department. At the conclusion of the orientation, my boss informed me that I would be working independently and under the mentorship of this college student, who would serve as needed assistance rather than constant guidance. Needless to say, I was terrified and overwhelmed as I had always received direct instruction and requirements when completing projects and assignments in the past.At this hospital, I worked under the System Redesign team, which was dedicated to observing and analyzing systems throughout the different health departments and clinics in order to improve efficiencies; I worked to physically install kiosks in the Primary Care Department to facilitate patient check in and added mirrors in Radiology to speed up appointment scheduling. However, beyond the hospital internship, hidden inefficiencies within my own life became glaringly obvious. I learned to break down some of the most mundane activities in my life and apply these principles of efficiency. It began with packing my backpack and dance bag the night before to ensure that I could sleep in the next morning and get ready for school faster. It then continued to moving my phone and schoolwork on opposite sides of the room to prevent distractions. Between schoolwork and extracurricular activities, a lack of time had always been a burden. Once I began looking at some of these simple tasks and processes as systems plagued with inefficiencies, I was able to locate the places in which productivity could be increased. While these initial applications of the principles were fairly self centered, I wanted to see how these principles would translate in some of my community service activities.Specifically when volunteering as a dance instructor for the unprivileged children in the local community, I wanted to maximize the two hours a week that I was given to expose these kids to dance, which was an opportunity that they were very rarely given. Instead of futile efforts to begin class by quieting down individual students, observing the dance class as a system helped identify more efficient and effective manner of achieving the desired result. To reduce the time it took to get all the students\\' attention every week, I would have the kids all gather and sit down in a large circle at the beginning of every class. Once they left their shoes right beside the door and walked into the classroom, they would be told to immediately gather together, which also helped the camp counselors quiet down the students and begin teaching in a more efficient manner. While observing people and situations as systems is far from natural, this way of thinking helped humanize some of the technical jargon utilized by the healthcare administrators in System Redesign. This internship at the Veterans Affairs Hospital allowed me to examine and evaluate multiple aspects of my life, allowing me to understand why and how certain actions lead to desired outcomes.Portraits never cease to intrigue me. Beyond the individual brushstrokes comprising the subject\\'s face, I find the emotion behind the frozen image of an individual, trapped by the frame, to be more compelling. As I walked by the portraits in San Francisco\\'s Legion of Honor, I stared at each meticulously painted pairs of eyes as my brain began to process the visual stimulus.In art history, there lies an interplay between intuition and intentionality. My world was one of instinct; when choosing board members for Key Club, I had already decided based on the charisma and demeanor of each candidate walking through the door. But art requires a methodical approach to observation resembling a scientific procedure in a clinical study. I learned to deconstruct artwork into its constituents: color, symbolism, materials, texture, subject, style. A single light source, a subtle rendition of chiaroscuro that Da Vinci would soon perfect in fifty years, cast a shadow on the subjects\\' faces. The triangular composition created by the two people and the dog was emphasized through a contrast between dark and light. The figures were elongated and lacked human rationality, characteristic of the Italian Renaissance. The portrait was filled with symbols: a dog to represent fidelity, the convex mirrors with tiny scenes from the Passion of Christ to represent the eye of God. It was after this deconstruction that Van Eyck\\'s Arnolfini Portrait began to transform. Art history ignited an understanding of artworks that had previously been impossible to interpret. The subjects were no longer stagnant or two-dimensional; the couple was in a sacred and matrimonious relationship filled with fidelity, observed by divine authority.However, there were unique instances in which deconstruction and intuition conflicted. Within seconds, art historians identified the Getty\\'s Anavysos Kouros as a fraud while months of scientific inquiry deemed it ancient treasure. After years of mastery, art historians possessed this ability to decipher art pieces with solely instinct. To me, art had been instinctual; movement was best improvised and intuition dominated conversation, but intriguingly, approaching organic human expression in a mechanical manner proved to be successful. After the Manchester attack, as I was teaching a jazz routine to local elementary school children in the downtown community, I caught glimpses of one of the children, Seetha, in the back corner with her head down and hands folded in her lap. The more I attempted to approach her, the more she closed herself off. Once I finally reached her, placing my hand on her shoulder, a small tear made its way down her cheek.This third grade child, who had lived in such an idyllic version of the world, void of judgement, now felt personally condemned for an attack with motives that she couldn\\'t even begin to comprehend. These words, just simply strung together, created a myriad of connotations and represented stereotypes that manifested themselves in her unconscious. \\'Why do they treat me this way?\\' she murmured under her breath.At that moment, I didn\\'t know what to do or what to say, and that hurt the most. As I stayed with Seetha, my hand still resting on her shoulder, the other children began noticing Seetha\\'s pain, and saved me from my embarrassment. I took a step back, watching them surround her with nothing but positive words and tight hugs. I played a lyrical song as the kids began to dance freely, rather than perform specific technical steps. Her tears dissipated and genuine laughter emerged, as dance had temporarily freed her from these burdens. It didn\\'t matter that she was in a room with other kids that she barely knew; dance made her feel connected and wanted.As the children rallied together, a visual cacophony of flailing limbs and emotions, I found dance\\'s power as an equalizer, diminishing stereotypes and fostering cohesion among individuals of a multitude of backgrounds. It was this dance program, introducing the arts into the lives of children, that allowed them to forget that they didn\\'t have the expensive dance shoes that other may have and escape the factions that lead to discrimination. Now, they radiated confidence and joy as they found this microcosm of society in which diversity holds the most power.\"}, {\"index\": 50, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Physically, besides our Chinese complexion, there\\'s one characteristic that has defined the Wei family: hair. Lots of it.I tie my bushy ponytail with two actual rubber bands, because normal hair-ties keep breaking\\\\u2014and still, it whacks my face when playing tennis. My brother never wears shorts on first dates, to hide his hairy legs. And since I was young, I\\'ve loved ruffling my mom\\'s abundant hair.That changed my junior year, when my mom came home with her hair shaved off.I could barely recognize her. It was in that moment that the reality of her breast cancer hit me. I felt compelled to do anything to help her. To be strong for her. I held her close and somehow I knew we were going to be okay.Her cancer made me step up as a daughter. I did things for her out of love that I would have never done for myself. When her joints ached, I scoured the internet to find comfortable shoes for her. When she needed exercise but was too tired, I did leg lifts with her in bed.After a few cycles of chemo, my mom\\'s blood counts were low. When she smelled her once-favorite foods, she wanted to throw up. But I knew she needed her nutrition. I asked the school\\'s cooking teacher for recommendations. She gave me a whole cookbook of just soups, and I experimented at home with new flavors, ranging from minestrone to broccoli-cheddar, unusual to our Chinese cuisine. Mom\\'s next blood test results showed her counts increased. I quit the tennis team to care for my mom. Tennis had been my first identity in high school. It shaped my work ethic and taught me resilience in the face of hard losses. But during tennis season, when my mom went through her toughest chemotherapy sessions, I knew I had to be there for her. In a way, tennis was an artificial environment to practice for the real challenges of life. I saw more powerful ways to use what the sport had taught me. My mom needed me more than my team did, and I needed more time with her.Mom\\'s cancer taught me that each moment was important. I\\'ll remember planting kisses on my mom\\'s face as I tucked her into bed. I\\'ll remember cleaning up her vomit with my dad in the small bathroom, working together with gloved hands. I\\'ll remember telling a classmate about my mom\\'s cancer, and her response: \\'I haven\\'t told anyone. I have leukemia. Now I realize I\\'m not alone.\\' Through laughter and conversations about family struggles, hospital visits, and favorite songs, we made a deep connection. I realized that there were important moments not just with family, but also with the people around me. I wanted to appreciate them all.As a journalist, I hoped to make moments important for others too. Where the boys basketball team saw their usual post-game meeting in the locker room, I saw a story of how a team became a family. Where a math teacher didn\\'t think twice about his doodling, I saw a hidden talent worth featuring. I found so much inspiration in learning about what made people uniquely themselves: their stories, ideas, opinions. I wanted to capture those unique stories of my school, for people to feel important and heard. I found my new identity, a student journalist: a listener who sees the world with curiosity, compassion and purpose\\\\u2014someone who helps empower others.This summer, I donated 9 inches of my ponytail. I imagine the strands bringing confidence to someone I\\'ll never know. As I helped my mom pick out a wig to wear when returning to work, I saw small hairs beginning to grow. I saw resilience.As our hair grows, I will too. Smiling through challenges and learning from them. Appreciating the people around me. Making every moment important.When I saw the iconic photo of Alan Kurdi washed ashore, I cried. After class, I stayed behind with my friend Meghana, trying to grasp the complexities of the Syrian Refugee Crisis, wishing we could do something. Online, Meghana and I discovered Paper Airplanes: a non-profit that connects students with Syrian refugees to tutor. We established Lynbrook\\'s chapter, inviting students to join through social media. Twenty committed to help.Through Paper Airplanes, I tutored a 17-year-old Syrian refugee living in Turkey, who wanted to take the TOEFL to attend college. Helping him grow from incomplete English sentences to his first essay filled me with pride. I wanted to be the best tutor possible for him, and I saw the other twenty tutors feel the same about their own students. But many were intimidated to teach English learners for the first time.I set out to help, reading education blogs and drawing from my experiences to create tutoring-workshops such as \\'Spicing up Grammar Lessons\\' and \\'Fun Writing Activities.\\' I also led discussions where we devised ways to improve lessons and empower our students. For example, Zahra\\'s student spoke Arabic during lessons because she was afraid to make mistakes in English. Together, we discussed how to create a safe space so students felt comfortable.Initially, some tutors didn\\'t quite understand the realities of the Syrian Refugee Crisis. When some students couldn\\'t be reached due to their unstable lives, I encouraged them to use it as a learning opportunity to understand what being a refugee meant. This year, we\\'ve expanded our leadership team and number of tutors and plan to spread more awareness about refugee and immigrant rights through speaker events. It has been so fulfilling to see the growth in our tutors: not only have they gained confidence in their leadership abilities, but they\\'ve also formed lasting friendships with their students and personal connections to this global issue.The Syrian Refugee Crisis remains a daunting issue to solve, but I believe through education and empathy, we can make a meaningful difference and make the world feel more connected.My junior year, creative problem solving took on a new meaning for me when my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. To help with the challenges arising from her chemotherapy, I found solutions with creativity and love.Chemotherapy killed my mom\\'s taste buds, and her once-favorite foods became difficult to swallow. I knew she needed her nutrition; I thought, if she were to try foods that she hasn\\'t eaten before, she would have no prior expectation of their flavor, so she wouldn\\'t be as disappointed. Every night, I would cook her different foods from different cuisines. I was ecstatic when she enjoyed them a lot more.However, another problem arose. A few hours after eating her meals, she would become nauseous and vomit her food, undigested. Her doctor told her this was normal. I knew vomiting was a side effect of chemotherapy, but I refused to accept that there was nothing I could do about it. Exercising, I thought, could be a possible solution. If she moved around, I thought, it could help my mom\\'s body actively digest food. I knew this wouldn\\'t solve the entire problem, but I hoped it would make a difference. So, I\\'d go on walks with my mom to encourage her to move around, and bought her new, comfortable shoes when her feet were swollen. As she had more chemo treatments, she became too tired to get out of bed. I created a workout for her to do in bed, consisting of leg lifts, crunches (with me holding down her legs), and arm circles \\\\u2014 all done without standing up. The exercise did help my mom\\'s digestion. It also helped her in ways I didn\\'t imagine: going on walks helped her calm her mind, and exercising together in bed gave us another way to bond together. An act of creativity not only brought a solution to a problem, but it also created happy memories. In taking care of my mom, I\\'ve learned to use creative problem solving to help others, and to face challenges with positivity and resilience.I\\'m fascinated by the interdisciplinary potential of computer science. Beyond data structures and algorithms, it\\'s about solving problems creatively.When I entered high school, I started teaching myself through MIT\\'s OpenCourseWare, working my way through problem sets with Python. In sophomore year, I took C++ courses at Foothill College. In addition to teaching me about object-oriented programming and pointers, my professor introduced me to the 3 P\\'s: Patience, Practice, and Perseverance. Today, I strive to use the 3 P\\'s in everything I do.My junior year, I realized technology could positively impact the way our school newspaper told stories, making them more compelling and accessible. As a student journalist, I saw that our community was filled with powerful stories that couldn\\'t fit in a monthly paper. So, I decided to build a website to put our stories online. The website increased our viewership, allowing parents and alumni to engage with our stories. When several staffers wrote online stories relating to the #MeToo movement, I compiled the stories together and coded our publication\\'s first multimedia package. It was an unique way our audience could experience a story, and I want to continue combining code and journalism to present powerful stories: from analyzing data for investigative stories to creating multimedia projects. When my mom\\'s breast cancer was diagnosed after she experienced symptoms, I wondered whether a machine-learning-based model could have detected her cancer during an annual mammogram months earlier, instead. I immersed myself in neural networks, activation and loss functions, weights and biases, pulling together Python libraries to create a model that can recognize breast cancer in mammograms. I was so excited when, uploading my mom\\'s mammogram to the model, I watched it circle her cancer\\'s location in red. I hope to continue this research in other fields, finding meaning of the world\\'s piles of data.Computer science is more than an academic subject: it\\'s a way to search for new solutions, to expand possibilities. I want to study both computer science and the humanities to tell compelling stories as a journalist and better solve problems that impact the people around me.As a student journalist, I\\'ve learned that every person has a meaningful story to tell. Sharing and listening to stories can make us more open-minded, compassionate, and understanding of the people and the world around us. I seek out the stories of others, listening and sharing them with compassion.Stories bring awareness and create tangible change. My co-editor and I filmed a documentary on the wave of youth activism following the Parkland shooting to capture this movement for our community; at our first screening, we distributed voter-registration forms. When I collected data on students\\' experiences with bullying for a feature, the principal shared it at an all-staff meeting about school culture. I wrote an editorial that brought attention to the school\\'s lack of emergency preparedness; the following school year, administrators conducted a Run, Hide, Defend drill. I interviewed a student at our school, who showed me how one person\\'s courage to speak out can spark a movement. He told me about his loneliness and depression, which led to drug use and an intentional overdose his senior year. He wanted others to hear his story: to break the stigma around mental health in our community, to help others realize they\\'re not alone, to spread hope and positivity. I spent countless hours writing the story, knowing I had to do it justice. I hoped it could inspire others the same way it inspired me. The story created a ripple effect. Our newspaper\\'s online traffic tripled, surpassing 1,200 views for the first time. At our school, mental health issues are apparent, but rarely talked about. The story led to students having more open conversations about mental health. A teacher said it reminded him of why he became a teacher. A parent translated the article into Chinese and shared it in a group-chat with hundreds of parents, where they discussed how to address mental health with their own children.Stories acknowledge the voices of individuals, bringing the community together. I want to use journalism to make people feel heard, to empower others to share their voices and to inspire positive change.Although I joined the school newspaper on a whim and had previously planned to take AP Computer Science, journalism has become a core part of the person I am today. To me, journalism is a way to see the world with curiosity and compassion. Everyone has a story, and journalism allows me to hear those stories \\\\u2014 to learn more about the people around me and be inspired by them. Journalism tells people, \\'Your story matters,\\' and I want to be someone who helps the community by showing people that their voices are important. I also love the fast-paced nature of journalism, how it pushes me to tap into abilities I never knew I had, like produce a high-quality story on a tight deadline.Journalism has taught me to experience the world with an open mind, to soak every moment in \\\\u2014 because wherever you go, there\\'s an exciting story.It\\'s Tuesday lunch. My club officers and I begin with a presentation about spicing up grammar lessons for English learners. Then, the classroom lights up with discussion, each tutor sharing about their student. \\'He\\'s so motivated!\\' says Sanjana, describing her 17-year-old student who wants to fight for peace in Syria. Zahra poses a question; her student from Saudi Arabia speaks Arabic during lessons because she is afraid to make mistakes in English. \\'What do you guys think I should do?\\'Together, our group come up with ways to help her student feel more comfortable during the online tutoring sessions.Two years ago, near the end of my sophomore year, this community of 30 people was only 3: my history teacher, my classmate, and me. Our world history teacher opened my eyes to the Syrian Refugee Crisis and the political, economic, and social factors that made it so difficult to solve. My classmate and I would stay in her classroom after school just talking about it, wishing there was something we could do.Then, I learned about Paper Airplanes \\\\u2014 an organization that connects English-speaking students with same-aged Syrian refugees to tutor. I told my friend about it, and last year we implemented it at Lynbrook. Through tutoring, we\\'ve learned to become better communicators and realized that, despite our students\\' varied life experiences, we\\'re still the same: teenagers with big dreams who just want to have fun.When I see a new club member begin tutoring, I\\'m filled with hope and excitement for them, eager to help them learn more about the world and make a new friend. This community shares a love for education, helping others, and immersing ourselves in world issues, trying to make a difference, instead of turning a blind eye to problems too difficult to solve.Why that College or School?Computer science isn\\'t just writing code to create a project; it\\'s a way of assessing problems and devising solutions for them. This way of thinking \\\\u2014 of breaking large problems into smaller, manageable pieces that can be solved by teams of people, of constantly coming up with ways to improve \\\\u2014 can be applied to so many fields, from medicine to education to journalism.At the University of Michigan, I hope to double major in computer science and communications to create systems that allow the stories we share to have a wider impact. Last year, I created a website for our school newspaper because I wanted to tell more stories than could fit in a monthly 16-page paper. I realized that technology can bring a story to life in exciting ways. From multimedia projects to data analysis and visualization, technology allows stories to leave an even larger impact on audiences and can be used to create lasting change. It empowers people to share their voices. That\\'s what technology should be about: empowering others. I want to be someone who can use her technical skills to empower other people to share their stories and show them that their voices matter.I\\'m ecstatic that the University of Michigan provides such a thorough curriculum to explore these ideas. Courses such as EECS 554, Introduction to Digital Communication and Coding, would help me build platforms that innovate the way people share stories: allow them to reach more people and expand the potential of multimedia. COMM 495, Future of Digital Media, would connect me with peers who also aspire to bring communities together with technology and stories, and together we could come up with new ways to do so.Moreover, I hope to be part of The Michigan Daily staff to incorporate my love for computer science and journalism to share the stories of the people around me, through gathering data for investigative projects and using web and multimedia tools to immerse an audience into a story.I want to study at the University of Michigan because of how much the school embraces the idea of \\'interdisciplinary.\\' I want to attend a school that embraces such a philosophy because computer science and communications are inherently interdisciplinary; computer science is applicable to so many fields and stories can be told about any subject and any person. I hope to minor, if not take classes in, urban studies and crime & justice to help me better understand the communities I want to serve after graduating. Taking classes as part of Michigan\\'s data science major will give me the skills needed to pursue data journalism, a way to tell powerful stories with both numbers and words that can contribute to even more impactful investigative reporting.As a student, I hope to learn more about my community by immersing myself in it and giving back through programs such as the Prison Creative Arts Project.University of Michigan\\'s focus on \\'it\\'s not just a major\\' and community outreach excites me because I will get to learn about the world in an interdisciplinary way and see the issues I care about through multiple perspectives.Idea or experience that makes you excited about learningI stared at Big Hero 6 on the screen, a substitute teacher\\'s attempt to control a class of 8th graders. Fascinated by futuristic San Fransokyo, I fell in love with Baymax and the way he could help others\\\\u2014with super strength and knowledge about every medical procedure. That day I knew I wanted to learn computer science: to push possibilities like Tadashi, Baymax\\'s designer, to create something to help people in ways never before imagined.When my mom was diagnosed with cancer, I wondered whether machine learning could have detected her cancer during an annual mammogram, instead of months later, after she felt symptoms. I had to find an answer.I immersed myself in this new world of neural networks, activation and loss functions, weights, and biases. The articles at first felt like reading a foreign language, pushing me to further understand those concepts. I was thrilled, in that moment when all the calculus concepts I learned in class clicked together with the project, and I rushed to explain it to my mom and brother.After pulling together Python libraries and making my own model, I was ecstatic when I uploaded my mom\\'s mammogram and saw it circle the location of her cancer in red.I want to apply this research to other fields such as education and journalism, using the potential of machine learning to find meaning in the piles of data in the world. The future is now. And I can be a part of creating it.Note to future roommateDear Roommate,To me, mornings and nights are special, and I\\'m so excited to share these times of the day with you! Mornings are filled with possibility\\\\u2014a chance to build upon who you were yesterday\\\\u2014and nights are a chance to reflect. Both are times to appreciate the present. I started morning runs this year. Will you join me? A friend created a workout for his sports science class, and one for me too. His random idea made me realize how awesome it feels to do at least one thing you\\'re proud of every day. In my favorite Japanese drama Miss Pilot, two female pilot trainees go on runs in the morning, encouraging each other, and suddenly, the whole dorm joins. Could that be us?At night, do you want to share bedside books? I\\'ll bring my copy of The Things They Carried, my favorite quotes highlighted in blue. What things do you carry? I carry the quirk of nodding a lot when I listen. I first noticed it watching myself on the school talk show. I do it because I\\'m listening to you! When I do, there\\'s no one more important to me.From my childhood, I carry my stuffed panda and my excitement over the weirdest things, like airplanes. What gets you excited like a little kid?When two pilots meet before their flight, it\\'s usually for the first time\\\\u2014like us. We\\'re the pilots for our college journey. I can\\'t wait for the experiences we\\'ll carry together.PatriciaSomething meaningful to you and why\\'I overdosed on purpose,\\' he* said, \\'When I woke up in the hospital, I saw my mom crying next to me. I finally realized life is worth living.\\'I sat next to him, listening intently. In that moment, there was no one more important. HIs words reminded me that every person is a world in itself, wrapped in stories, experiences, and emotions, that, when shared with another person, gives them a new perspective. His world affirmed the importance of empathy and compassion. I was in awe of his courage and strength, grateful that I got to witness it.My duty now was to do his story justice. I owed it to him, who wanted it told. If the story could help one person, it would have been worth it.After I published his story, a ripple effect started. A teacher said he was reminded of why he became a teacher. A parent translated the story into Chinese; online, it sparked a conversation about mental health among hundreds of parents who often shied away from the topic.I\\'ll forever carry his story with me. Today, the community carries his story, too. They carry his message to be kind and judge less\\\\u2014to acknowledge the stories in the people around them. People\\'s stories are meaningful because they stop you in your tracks, compelling you to step inside someone else\\'s shoes and emerge more open-minded and compassionate. His showed me the power one story has to start a movement.\"}, {\"index\": 51, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Forced labor. Constant surveillance. Starvation camps. My 25-year-old dad decided to leave. He was disgusted by the idea of spending the rest of his life in the country in which he grew up, where neighbors betrayed each other to the secret police in hopes of gaining government favor and two million people died of hunger from the socialist economy\\'s perpetual inability to produce food. My dad dreamt of coming to America; even the Iron Curtain could not prevent the spread of the peculiar news that the people in the United States were free. So, he disguised himself as a glass merchant (one of the few groups allowed to leave Romania, although only under strict surveillance) and jumped off a train in the Hungarian countryside with only the clothes he was wearing and about 100 dollars sewn into his shirt shoulder. The communists came for his parents a few days later. They jailed my grandpa; to this day, he does not speak of what they did to him. They never caught my dad. If they had, I would not exist.My dad is now a successful American physician. Although in my comfortable American life I am far removed from the daily hardships in communist Romania, hearing his story as a child ensured that I have always appreciated the variety of opportunities I am afforded simply because I live in the United States. His story has become integral to my identity and shaped the lens through which I view the world. I value my ability to receive an American education because it cost my family much more than money; it cost a gamble with death. I know that to compensate for the high price of my education, I must produce an immense return on the investment. Furthermore, learning the story of my dad\\'s escape to the West taught me to prize the liberty ensured to Americans. I am privileged to live in a country whose government was instituted to protect liberty, rather than destroy it, and I am grateful for the unique cocktail of Enlightenment philosophies embodied in the free society for which my dad risked his life.Although I appreciate the privileges unique to this nation, being a child of immigrants guarantees I also value cultural diversity, especially because my personal identity is an odd blend of Romanian affability and American practicality. Having learned Romanian at home and English in kindergarten, I had always wanted to add to my repertoire a language that was a product of my own accomplishment and allowed me to communicate with people of a previously unapproachable culture. In middle school, I taught myself Spanish with textbooks, drilling myself on grammar rules for two hours a day until I was confident in my ability to converse fluently. That skill has allowed me to participate in a community to which I would otherwise have no exposure. I now teach Hispanic immigrants English and help them adjust to American society. As they piece together words into sentences and grow accustomed to guttural English R\\'s, I see a reflection of my dad\\'s similar attempts 25 years ago. As English begins to roll smoothly off the students\\' tongues, they are empowered to create new blends of their own principles, fusions of American values and their own traditions, like the one my dad passed on to me.My dad\\'s illegal escape from communist Romania was perilous, but it has granted me access to new perspectives that have stretched my mind, redefined my culture, and motivated me to help others navigate their own immigration obstacles. The high price my dad paid for the lifestyle I was handed at birth is a testament to my privilege. I have been fortunate to reap the benefits of my dad\\'s sacrifice for freedom.Describe an intellectual experience that has meant the most to you.Competing in math taught me how to think. I often tell people that if I had not participated in math competitions since the third grade, I would lack most of my current mental capabilities. Today, due to my high school\\'s lack of an adequately funded and coached math team, I consider myself primarily a debater, but before high school, \\'mathlete\\' was my identity. Competitive math gave me some of my best friends and most influential role models, as well as numerous trophies to display on my bookshelf. However, my most valuable acquisition was invisible, and one I did not appreciate until later: an ability to use logic to solve problems.Math competitions teach, but they don\\'t give answers. They train you to deduce them yourself. Competitive success depends upon a profound understanding of how to manipulate mathematical concepts to produce solutions. You must decipher problems, separate distractions from relevant information, and invent tricks that fill in missing pieces of puzzles. You tackle tens of problems testing hundreds of different concepts whose linkages you race to exploit. In competition, math is not divided into geometry, algebra, trigonometry, and calculus. There is only logic, which can be applied to planes, variables, triangles, or curves. If you understand the logic of trigonometry, you can modify it at will and apply it to calculus. If you can\\'t, you lose. Competitions train you to perceive the ways in which principles of mathematical reasoning connect numerous real-world situations. They teach you that \\'thinking like a mathematician\\' means searching for deeper truths behind information to discover its broader implications.Competition math propelled my academic success by teaching skills that were conspicuously absent from my high school classes. Math classes in a large public high school prioritize efficiency over depth, sidelining critical thinking for speed. Rather than train me to devise my own solutions to problems, school math tells me to plug numbers into a memorized formula to produce an answer without ever questioning its logic. Why create new ways to solve problems when you can ace tests by following prescribed procedures? As a result, math classes, which should supposedly teach the logic and problem-solving skills crucial to every other academic discipline, instead leave students lacking the depth required to solve problems to which their memorized procedures do not apply.Had I not learned creativity and critical thinking from competition math, I would not have achieved much of my academic success. My debate skill relies on my ability to strategize and cleverly exploit opponents\\' logical errors. I learned Spanish grammar by envisioning nouns and verbs as components of an equation that fit together in a particular way to produce meaning. My chemistry and physics classes required little effort once I understood the logical behavior of molecules and waves; the formulas in my textbook were simply written representations of those rational conclusions and could be reinvented at will. The realization that my studies in every subject simply required different applications of the same mathematical problem-solving principles I had learned in the third grade empowered me to maximize my education.Competition math has changed the way I learn. It has succeeded where school has often failed: in teaching me to seek deeper connections behind concepts and pursue knowledge beyond the realm of mechanical fact memorization. Competitions revealed to me that although \\'critical thinking\\' is a common catchphrase on the lips of politicians who claim to improve schooling, it is meaningless absent an educational system that prioritizes depth, logic, and inquiry. To be authentic, learning cannot be superficial. Blindly following a script does not require thought or promote intellectual growth. Instead, competition math empowered me to write the script myself.\"}, {\"index\": 52, \"new_personal_statement\": \"For the past three years I have been fortunate enough to be a part of the Bronx Science community. I have been influenced by talks on the train ride home about research in autoimmune diseases to sharks, inspired by teachers who stay hours after class to help students understand rotational kinematics, and worked with classmates through tough nights of studying for math exams, by combating problems together. Bronx Science has refined my work ethic, improved my time management skills and transformed me into something of a professional juggler, when it comes to balancing classes, extracurriculars and my social life.My beliefs have been challenged, and now I hold a more positive perspective on learning from my mistakes. I developed a better mindset on room for improvement, whether it comes to everyday calculus homework or a paper on Combinatorics for Math Fair. I seek out new ways to improve my methodology, and found myself to learn how to think creatively and freely throughout my years at Bronx Science. I always had an endless income of intellectual resources at Bronx Science, and I hope to join a community that will do the same for me in college.UChicago will give me with an even greater expansion of opportunities to develop my intellectual growth. I want to be in an environment where learning is a constant and students will have their own idiosyncrasies and methods for me to learn from. A quirky community that will teach me, as much as it will be my second home, with friends and mentors that I will remember for life. At UChicago I will be able to pursue everything at Bronx Science, and more from access to research labs to a philosophy class that will educate me on ethical dilemmas in science and society.I want to be able to use the skillsets I gain in studying neuroscience with a strong foundation in the humanities, through my college experience to focus on researching cognition and education. UChicago will provide me this through its interdisciplinary curriculum and impact my way of thinking through members of its community who all have an intense passion for learning, feed on ideas, and hold a ferocious sense of curiosity. An environment full of students and teachers hungry to share and learn more knowledge is what I want in a college. With more than the occasional gedanken, and studious yet energetic average student, UChicago is the best place for me. Here, my active mind will thrive and grow from new seeds of ideas implanted from my peers; only to be nourished and well kept by the solid educational foundation that UChicago will offer me.I spend a substantial amount of my free time delving into new books that capture my interest. Novels have played a heavy hand in determining my character, setting the catalyst for my imagination through fantasy stories about epic wars, and shaping my beliefs about being an independent thinker through architecture. It is without a doubt that reading has had the largest impact on my intellectual growth, in terms of keeping an open mind and casting myself into the viewpoints of people through all different walks of life. It is a testimony of truth when William Styron stated, \\'A great book should leave you with many experiences, and slightly exhausted at the end. You live several lives while reading.\\' Reading about culture and religion in different languages has given me a whole new perspective on syntax and the nature of language. Untranslatable words such as my personal favorites: saudade, toska and duende, has filled me with a transcended level of awareness in the power of words. Living at home with three different cultures made communication difficult at times in my family. However, the silver lining exists in which my world has become richly filled with stories of my mother\\'s family originating from a Korean general back fourteen generations, and my father\\'s ancestry rooting from the same tribe, Qureshi, that the Prophet Muhammad came from. Literature has exposed me to unconventional ideas, pushed me to challenge my beliefs and redefined my approach of the world time after time. Books have instigated a sense of autonomous character in myself, in which the strength a character in a novel displays, translates into my own willingness to face adversity. Reading has also enlightened my life, with individual quirks displayed in each new book. I have been engulfed in euphoria with the success of the protagonist, drowned in melancholy with the death of a loved character and cried rivers of tears from endless laughter after an outrageously humorous chapter. But overall, reading has gifted me with the privilege to experience eunoia as the thoughts from temperamental artists and brilliant writers have been shared with my own mind. The following list goes to show the books that I have read over the past 12 months. Catch-22 by Joseph HellerQuadrivium The Cartoon Introduction to Philosophy by Michael F. PattonMoby-Dick by Herman MelvilleNicomachean Ethics by Aristotle Graceling by Kristin Cashore The Invasion of the Tearling by Erika Johansen The Talmud (English-Korean edition) by Marvin Tokayer Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer The Secret Agent by Joseph ConradParadise Lost by John MiltonThe Fault in Our Stars by John Green The Inferno by Dante AlighieriRed Queen by Victoria AveyardGame of Thrones by George R.R. Martin The Book Thief by Markus ZusakA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce \"}, {\"index\": 53, \"new_personal_statement\": \"As a child, I was irrationally afraid of mushrooms, particularly sliced ones. The intimidating slices always had a curved top attached to a rectangular stalk. To me, these pieces resembled faces, staring out at me from their two curved-top eyes. The worst offenders resided on pizzas, poisoning the melted layers of cheese atop my favorite dish. I believed that they were always staring at me, judging my every move, despite their inanimate nature. Nobody understood the anxiety provoked by this harmless fungus, but personally, I could not get over the fact that the mushroom\\'s \\'eyes\\' were watching me.My childhood fear of the judgment that mushrooms\\' eyes held became a fear of eye contact during my childhood. I was anxious that others were critiquing me with every glance. My reserved nature stemmed from this fright, and the thought of speaking in front of people was enough to make sweat perspire on my forehead. But I no longer wanted to be characterized by my fear, nor did I want it to prevent me from communicating with others. One day, in sixth-grade, I reached towards my face and removed my glasses, turning the world into an abstract portrait.My 20/200 vision was no longer a weakness but rather a strength. When I spoke, I did not fear eye contact, as others\\' eyes resembled circles\\\\u2014empty of emotion and detail. This impairment allowed me to overcome my fear of communication, and I readily embraced my new persona. When my name was called, I could confidently rise up and express my opinion without worrying about my classmates\\' piercing stares. I was not afraid to be the person who cuts the awkward silence in a room. It was this newfound discovery that sparked my love for public speaking and fostered my passion for Speech and Debate. Something I previously dreaded became something that I voluntarily adored.During my presentations, I forced myself to understand that the clumps of color before me were people. This cognitive dissonance often confused me; I was uncertain about whether I was staring at everyone\\'s eyes. Nevertheless, my pupils surveyed the room and rested upon different audience members when needed. My eyes could have been gazing at the audience\\'s foreheads, but the feedback praising my \\'strong eye contact\\' assured me otherwise.Through time, my strategy began to weaken. I could hardly make out the words my teachers wrote and became reliant on squinting to catch a glimpse of the world. Students and teachers alike joked about my squinting, urging that I wear the glasses I owned. Still, my hands could never reach for the frames. I was not fully aware that with every glance I dodged, I lost the opportunity to connect and see. It was not enough to listen. To truly hear someone I had to be able to see their perspective, and likewise, see them.Whether I was performing as Cesar Chavez, with my iconic S\\\\u00ed Se Puede sign, at a history competition, or giving a biology presentation on Joseph Lister, I felt distant. So, halfway through junior year, I did the unthinkable: I put my glasses back on. The fear of the world that was previously instilled in me dissipated as those around me encouraged and supported me. Although I still prefer my pizzas plain, my life is now anything but.I can finally get to know who people really are, beyond the blurred faces to which I was accustomed. Facial expressions convey what words cannot and often show the true feelings someone is harboring. I plan to pay attention to these hints of insight and to proactively strive to be the person others feel comfortable around. I know what it feels like to shelter myself, and I want to help those around me reach past what secludes them. Looking at the world through my plastic lenses, I now feel invincible, and no stare can take that away.\"}, {\"index\": 54, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I have never considered the question: \\'Is it because I am Black?\\' because it often sounds like a convenient way to redirect a personal shortcoming to someone else; however, I couldn\\'t help but wonder as I stood in the dance studio, at the ballet barre, surrounded by all of those assigned to my beginners-level ballet class, \\'Is it because we are all Black?\\' I observed the patterns, noticing that the majority of the Caucasian dancers got the parts in the dance pieces, the skinnier girls were lauded during ballet class, and performance opportunities were awarded to those who had internal connections. It seemed that the talent aspect of the dance art form came secondary to unrelated factors of race, body shape, and connections. This left little opportunity for minorities like myself to advance in the dance world; however, I was determined to wake up the world around me, starting at my school, Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. Reflecting on the issues I found to be most prevalent in the dance world and my environment, I decided to explore the underrepresentation in ballet, the implicit bias, and the double standard. I chose choreography as an outlet for my concerns, addressing these issues in a way that allowed audience members to gain a new perspective on the issues without feeling as though they were being reprimanded or forced to conform to a different point of view. Initiating a conversation through choreography proved to be a logical first step in solving the problem of perspective.To bring awareness to the inherent discrimination that exists within the dance world, I created my own initiative entitled \\'Turning Tables\\', which is an annual dance performance that features choreography from myself as well as many of my peers at my school. Each piece is crafted with hopes of highlighting the overlooked social issues in dance. The dancers represent a variety of dance levels, cultural identities, body types, and socioeconomic backgrounds - all emphasizing the themes of inclusivity and equality. The outcome of the initial presentation of Turning Tables was a captivated audience that expressed their satisfaction in having their artistic senses engaged and their perspectives broadened. Since it\\'s inception, Turning Tables has extended its mission to offer underrepresented groups dance programs through the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Dallas. It is important to introduce young people to dance, in the hope that they will begin to consider dance as a viable career option that should not be inhibited by one\\'s own connections, background, or race. I never would have imagined that my concerns would become my platform; however, some may say that my platform is nothing more than a \\'race card\\'. That may be the perspective of some, and it\\'s definitely easier for some to assume such a posture that to examine the position. To the contrary, Turning Tables encompasses my vision, and I\\'ve spent countless My dad slammed the English-Spanish dictionary down on the table, ripped open a fresh pack of crisp white index cards, handed me a ballpoint pen and told me to copy down every word in the dictionary. This is how my dad insisted that I was to learn how to read. I was only five years old, but I knew that there must be another way to learn how to read that did not involve me rewriting the entire dictionary. I felt like it would have made more sense to skip these unnecessary steps and just open a book. I remember my dad making me stay in the Junior Performing Dance Ensemble two years in a row to make sure that I had achieved complete mastery before attempting to move up to the next level. I felt like it would have made more sense for me to move up with my friends after just one year. My dad always made sure that I started at the beginning of the number line and wore double zero on my soccer jersey despite me wanting to skip straight to the number one. He even made me research queen Cleopatra before I could be her for Halloween. My dad claims he knows everything about golf. I remember him taking my sisters and me out to the country club ranges and teaching us the steps of the game. Step one: \\'get your grip.\\' I assumed his goal in starting with getting a strong grip on the golf club was to establish a strong foundational base that would make hitting the ball easier. My environment has changed many times, from struggling to make friends at a new predominantly caucasian Catholic school to being fearful of the six weeks I was to spend by myself in New York City for the Alvin Ailey Summer Dance Intensive. However, in the face of these environmental challenges, I have always relied on slowing down and following the sequential steps that allow me to regain control of the situation, re-establish a strong base, and get my grip. In light of challenges, I am prepared to move forward.I have had many experiences that have shaped me as a person but having a strong foundational base has been the most substantial. I believe that my dad instilled this mindset in me in order to emphasize the unpredictability of life and the importance of facing life with purpose. Because of this, I realize the importance of having a strong foundation in everything I do. I am able to approach life confident and prepared, knowing that I am well equipped for all new situations and environments.\"}, {\"index\": 55, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Call 911! Jack is choking!\\' my mother screamed. I was five years old when my family thought my toddler brother was choking on a pretzel. In fact, Jack was having a grand mal seizure. His subsequent diagnosis of autism led to my fascination with the brain and a desire to understand how each neuron connection determines our lives \\\\u2013 both our challenges and our triumphs. As a child, I was amazed by my parents\\' explanation of how our family could help \\'re-wire\\' Jack\\'s brain by prompting new neuron pathways. Part of that process involved turning our house into a child\\'s dream with all the downstairs furniture being replaced by ball pits, parachute swings, and a trampoline. Combined physical and verbal games, like singing \\'pop pop the Jack popcorn!\\' while bouncing on the trampoline, became part of my everyday routine with Jack.When I was ten and Jack six, we went to see \\'The Lion King\\' on Broadway. Before the show even started, my family was asked to leave because Jack\\'s humming noise disturbed others. His tantrum of confusion outside the show left me shaken but determined to find \\\\u2013 or create \\\\u2013 a place where Jack and others like him would feel welcome with their families.As Jack was nearing middle school, I saw his connections to friends disappearing. He had previously thrived socially because at five years-old, he did not need fully developed language to laugh and play; however, by ten years old, Jack\\'s circle of friends became the stuffed animals he carried in his backpack. The childhood friends were nice to him but moved on when they found Jack could not hold a conversation.Entering high school, I became more concerned about Jack\\'s lack of friends and the absence of public places where he felt comfortable. Inspired by the mental image of Jack happily swimming across the pool at my family\\'s summer day camp for hours, surrounded by campers, I created My Swim Friends - a free program for children aged 3 to 21 with special needs. They arrive at the camp with their entire family in the summer, eager to make friends: the special needs and their siblings each have a one-on-one buddy. Everyone enjoys a party-style buffet as lunch because each Sunday is truly a party celebrating each child. The parents surprise even themselves when they close their eyes relaxing poolside, knowing their children are well-cared for and can act without fear of being asked to leave. Through the inclusion of the entire family, the siblings realize that having a brother or sister with special needs is a blessing \\\\u2013 something I understood early on. I designed a website, created a Facebook page, recruited my friends and teachers as volunteers, and obtained business sponsors, including Wegmans and the Manalapan Police Department. Seeing the success of My Swim Friends, I extended the program into the fall, calling it \\'My Sports Friends\\' and replacing swimming with fall activities. During both seasons, Jack puts down his backpack of friends and engages with a fun-loving group of children with special needs, their neuro-typical siblings, and volunteer buddies. My Swim Friends is a 501\\\\u00a9(3) nonprofit organization that has already grown from 20 to 120 children and will continue even while I am away at college.My motivation to pursue an education in biomedical engineering with a focus on neuroscience comes from my extraordinary experiences living with Jack. One of his therapists had said to me, \\'When you walk in the room, Jack should say to himself, \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018My life just got better\\'.\\' Through My Swim Friends, I have been able to make 12 Sundays a year better for all the children (and their parents) in the program. My aspiration is to use science and technology to help all individuals affected by neurological challenges live more functional, happier lives.\"}, {\"index\": 56, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Most afternoons during elementary school, I could be caught perusing my grandpa\\'s National Geographic collection, while my mom was at work. Neither the aroma of my grandma\\'s food nor her scolding me to eat could keep me away from the pages of those magazines. Only after many minutes would I get up to enjoy the food she had made. Soon after, I would rush back to explore the photographs, traveling the world.Realizing my interest in photography, my grandpa gave me my first camera when I was eight: a simple Canon point-and-shoot. No other toy would exhilarate my mind as much as the small machine that takes in light to form an image. I spent hours taking pictures of grandpa\\'s flowers in his miniature garden. When I felt adventurous, I might walk to the neighborhood park in search of squirrels to photograph. But I desired more. Like the photographers from the National Geographic magazines, I wanted to go underwater to take pictures of whales, to witness the stunning northern lights, to observe Inuit hunters fishing on the ice. Most of all, I wished to bring back photographs to share what I find on my adventures.Although I have not reached my goal of traveling the world just yet, I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to visit many beautiful places. I have seen voodoo shops in New Orleans, children walking to class barefoot in rural Vietnam, the hustle and bustle of New York City, and the hurricane-stricken U.S. Virgin Islands. I spoke with a local woman on the island of St. Croix in the summer of 2018 as she offered to guide me to the market. She described how Hurricanes Irma and Maria had torn through the island, destroying what was in their paths. She lost her home, her children lost their school, and the island lost its hospital. After this short ten minute conversation, I quickly began to feel more connected to the place I was visiting. I had seen the hurricane damage from walking around the island and photographing it, but the woman\\'s story was what I needed to understand. With this knowledge, I felt more comfortable sharing the perspectives of the people who survived the hurricanes and was able to mirror these perspectives in my editing and composition, thus accurately portraying the emotion behind the photographs.As much as I am consumed by wanderlust, photography has become a significant part of my life here at home. I discovered portrait photography in freshman year and started to photograph my friends. Locals took notice of my work from my Instagram posts and began to ask for photoshoots. My best friend suggested that I could earn money from my photography, so with some marketing through social media, I built a business. People from all over San Jose began hiring me for prom, graduation, birthday, and fitness shoots. Because of photography, I am motivated to further explore my community in search of new photoshoot locations. I used to think San Jose and the surrounding area were boring places. However, collaborating with other photographers and utilizing overly familiar places as photoshoot locations have helped me gain different perspectives on the world around me, making home quite fascinating after all.From working with a camera, I jump-started my small business while advancing my artistic skills. I have developed a profound interest in worlds other than my own, with an inclination to explore and comprehend their history and culture. I am more open-minded after meeting many people and learning about the different lives they lead. Ultimately, photography has paved the way for my discovery of new people, places, and lifestyles. I know I will continue to have my camera in my hand, documenting my experiences and building connections with my environment, wherever life takes me.Every Sunday morning, I would see my fellow Venture Crew members joylessly walk into the meetings. I joined the crew because I saw a brochure for Venturing, depicting high adventures and young adults practicing leadership and technical skills. However, our meetings involved a flag ceremony and scouts scrolling through their phones until it was time to go home. I knew that I was not receiving the ideal experience from being in this scout crew, but rather than joining another crew, I made it my mission to transform this group.At the next meeting, instead of following the same agenda, I led everyone in a game that encouraged them to get to know each other. Then, I invited the crew to get lunch together. Each person was still quiet, but I started seeing smiles. I spoke to a couple of my other crew officers who also wanted to help, and we decided that a leadership training would be beneficial for the group. I assigned specific duties to my fellow officers and we prepared a two-day leadership workshop consisting of lessons that introduced the crew to time-management, communication, and team-building skills. For each week that followed, I continued to encourage participation by asking each scout for his or her opinion, by delegating tasks to each individual, and by doing cooperative work. We continued to have lunch together after almost every meeting. During our meetings and trainings, we built leadership and teamwork skills, but during lunch, we built friendships. Both of these aspects together made us a stronger crew.When it was time to get serious about planning a white-water rafting trip, everyone was pitching ideas on which river to go to, what to eat, and what other activities we wanted to do at the campsite. Each member volunteered for a task whether it was grocery shopping, contacting the campsite, or coordinating rides. I successfully brought my team together to achieve a common goal. As a leader, I motivated and inspired my crew to do their best to step up and be leaders themselves. As I walk through any tourist destination, I see cameras of all kinds, pointed in every angle imaginable. With just one click, we can retain a memory that may have otherwise lasted a millisecond. For me, photography is not just a way to capture memories. It is art.As with many beginning artists, I was sometimes discouraged. My skills were not developed and I worried that I did not have the right gear to be successful. I did not have enough money to buy more than the beginner camera kit from Costco. My pictures were more pixelated than other photographers\\'. They seemed to lack depth and the distortion was noticeable. However, I was determined to continue practicing.I realized that gathering raw images was only the first step. It is the moment I sit down, open my computer, and plug in my micro-SD card that my creativity jumpstarts. After correcting basic lighting and color, my pictures come to life in Photoshop where I can defy reality in a multitude of ways. Want a solar system with a human head as the central gravitational force? No problem. A reflection of yourself that is impossible according to the rules of science? Got it. I discovered how to make my projects unique. I posted them on Instagram and created my own website. Schoolmates started to take notice and requested photoshoots. As prom and graduation season approached, my friends suggested that I should start charging for my photography. Making money had not come to mind before, but I knew I somehow had to fund my photography. And people were willing to pay for my work. I marketed myself and acquired paying clients through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, eventually allowing me to upgrade my camera.From photography, I learned how to create digital art and run a small business. Not only did creativity come into play when crafting my photos, but also when publicizing my work. I did not let my financial drawbacks hinder my skill. Nor did I let my label as a \\'beginner\\' define me as a photographer. I took all my struggles to my mom. Even though she was not fluent in English, she helped me work on poems for my third grade assignments. When I was too scared to ask for the bathroom key at McDonald\\'s, I begged her to ask for me. If I did not understand the material in class, I asked my mom rather than the teacher. I was an extremely shy child, and she was my voice. I survived by relying on her. Not once did she encourage me to find solutions for myself. In 2012, she sat me down with tears in her eyes. She said three words that would change everything: \\'I have cancer.\\'My mom did recover and return home after surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, but life was never the same. She no longer had a job, and I could see that she was ashamed of her financial instability.I realized that I could no longer be dependent on my mother. I started speaking up at school and in public. I had to take initiative and find resources to support not only myself academically but my sister as well. As soon as I turned 14, I took a job tutoring other students so that I could help my mother pay for groceries. I navigated my way through high school on my own. I advised my sister on her life and assisted her with homework. I learned to cook and prepare meals, relieving my mother\\'s stress. Initially, I thought my situation was extremely unfair. Why was I spending so much time taking care of myself and doing tasks my peers had their parents do for them? There will never be an answer as to why I was placed in these circumstances, but I am grateful for the effect they had on me. Being self-sufficient and also a source of strength for my little sister taught me to be responsible and independent. I now face every challenge with confidence, knowing that I was able to overcome such a difficult one at a young age while demonstrating maturity and reliability. Kids, ages six to eleven, eagerly hold their robots, waiting for their turn to race. Six hours prior, none of them had ever touched a robot-making kit. They come from low-income families that do not have the finances to provide them with this experience. However, by the end of the day, they have learned how to build a robot and program simple commands for it. As Vice President of Programs of the non-profit, STEM in Motion, I am responsible for planning our frequent workshops. Proud of the work my team and I have done, I take a step back and admire the liveliness of the environment. However, one detail stands out to me. There is not a single girl in the room.Realizing this, I took the initiative to expand the program to a different group who may not be familiar with STEM topics: young women.As the only female on the STEM in Motion leadership team, I sometimes felt I did not belong. Even though women are starting to pursue careers in STEM, this area of study is still predominantly male. As a result, I met with my fellow leaders and spearheaded the organization of a workshop for girls. I designed flyers, promoted the event on social media, and spoke to young Girl Scouts about the opportunity.  After 4 months of diligent planning, I hosted STEM in Motion\\'s first \\'Girls in STEM\\' workshop. That day, supported by my team, I excitedly introduced over 30 girls to robotics and computer programming. As we wrapped up the day, a girl approached me with enthusiasm, asking how soon she could return. Instilling this curiosity for a subject so foreign to the girls was my ultimate goal and I knew I had succeeded.As a young woman from a low-income family, I grew up ignorant about STEM, a subject I love and in which I am deeply immersed. I know I would have benefited from earlier exposure to STEM. Through STEM in Motion, I strive to open doors to future opportunities for youth who may be facing the same circumstances as I did.\"}, {\"index\": 57, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'An arm bends inwards\\' -Korean proverbBones lay sprawled over my diagrams until my table is as much lab bench as it is artist desk. I raise a replica of a beaver pelvic girdle to the light and run a finger over the minute dips. With my drawing tablet, my other hand recreates the form as a 3D-model in Blender, a modeling software. I swipe over the tessellation of polygons with a \\'crease\\' brush until dimples form along the structure. The pelvic ilia become wings. The ischia a bodice, lined by vertebrae. It\\'s an anatomy class and a fashion design session. Leonardo Da Vinci spent a lifetime studying anatomy to create realistic art. To create surrealist art, with my own interpretations that sway others, I always start with careful examinations of scientific principles.After the mannequin\\'s measurements are processed, a planar-cut tool divides the 3D-model into three pieces, printed separately: two ischia and one back-piece composed of two wings.I trace the mannequin\\'s contours. Did I curve the ischia enough to fit over the breasts? Were the ilia stretched enough to actually look like wings when placed at the shoulder blades? Most importantly, are the pieces stable on the mannequin? Yes, yes, and no. Wire between the ischia and back-piece isn\\'t sturdy enough; the asymmetrical ischia droop, wobble, and clack together. A rigid connector makes it impossible to place the structure over the mannequin.My fingers fly over the keyboard.Inflate. Crease. Repeat.Why is this combination so familiar?Oh. Yes. It was from my first 3D-model: my mother\\'s face.Inflate. My mother\\'s jaw is strong from a decade of chewing gum. During her first American job, she left home at 11PM and returned at 5PM--she chewed to stay awake. In middle school, I didn\\'t wake up for myself; I cooked breakfast for my younger brother and walked with him to our school bus. It was the strength in my mother\\'s jaw that I grew under, the memory I remember when attempting challenges.Crease. The white scar tissue above her lip spoke of a past where she cowered on the peeling bathroom floor, a quivering ball as my father struck her swollen belly and she cradled me from within. Her wrinkles are prominent when she holds the hand of my grandmother, who gazes back with dull, Alzheimer\\'s-ruined-eyes. My mother taught me independence and how to keep responsibilities amidst relationships and divorce.Creating my mother\\'s stricken expression immortalized in plastic, I was helpless. Emotions wrestled with fact and past. It\\'s frozen, I thought. Too real.But I can still give my fashion design movement. I just need to surpass material constraints.That night, I watch my mother ladle soup into bowls. Her biceps strain to clutch the vessel and her forearm muscles bulge as she scrapes the bottom of the pot. Her muscles tighten like springs; but all elastics eventually recoil.My arms dart to catch the pot. Aha! As I bend my arms to keep it steady, I realize the key: elbows. Connecting the ischia to the back-piece requires a hinge for rotation along one axis, which would allow the pieces to be placed or removed easily from the mannequin. Like an elbow joint, my 3D-printed connector consists of two parts: one with a hollow cylindrical head and one with a solid cylindrical head that fits inside. Meanwhile, ball-and-socket joints anchored by annular ligaments between the wings allow them to move, creating fluidity and life. With flexion principles and fabrics, science and art, I can make the work both visually captivating and structurally sound.In the gallery, the bodice remains stable and the wings flutter with the breeze as viewers walk by. It even appears to rock with every double-take, every surprised exhale. It\\'s organic, dynamic, a combination of forces. It\\'s a balance-beam: science and art, fabric and technology. Stability and growth. With movement, flaws only add to the surrealism.\"}, {\"index\": 58, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The Joy of Life.As an eloquent narrative goes, the main character finds the love of his life to be inconspicuous. I have long determined that I would always cherish the joy of life in both pits and pinnacles of my story, but remained oblivious on how to obtain it\\\\u2013urging myself the same question each morning, \\'What can I do to attain genuine enjoyment in my story?\\'When researching for the HighScope MUN conference, articles of diversity greeted my arrival. Searching for credible guides was virtually an obstacle\\\\u2013hindered by waves of unreliable MUN articles and prestigious yet expensive MUN courses. Exasperated, I spontaneously messaged three of my friends who were just as exhausted, \\'Hey, why don\\'t we create our own guide? Why don\\'t we start a free platform for anyone in the world to learn about MUN?\\'With my freshly-introduced conceptualization, the philosophy of my innovative pursuit showered me with excitement. Though, the initial responses weren\\'t all kudos with several friends opposing my concept and local companies rejecting my pitching proposals. Nonetheless, the rumbling winds of contradiction transitioned as momentum when I unintentionally captured myself \\'procrastinating\\' 6-8 hours a day during winter break, constructing the fundamentals of my startup: teaching myself to build a website with captivating UI/UX, teaching myself social media marketing strategies, reaching out to MUN ambassadors like Alexia Sideris, and producing numerous articles and videos\\\\u2013essentially resources that everyone has equal access to. Hence, MUN for Everyone (M4E) was born.Exhilarated by the emerging response from our audience, I started to welcome our readers to collaborate with us as writer volunteers; the belief was that the most dependable MUN guide would come from delegates themselves\\\\u2013from the community, for the community.Publishing our first article by our first volunteer, the next few hours were monopolized by the constant buzzing of my phone. What\\'s this? Messages like \\'I\\'m so proud of you!\\', \\'Certainly makes me happy!\\', and \\'Full of potential for great innings waiting!\\' were predominating the platform. But these warm praises were not meant for me, nor the platform. They were meant for Kandiah, the writer who wrote the extract. Kandiah\\'s teachers and families filled the comments with wonderful admiration, expressing how they were absolutely proud of her accomplishment for publishing an article on M4E.Reading all these warm messages for my writer, I felt utterly at peace. Little did I know that such incident would internally generate this beautiful warm passion within my heart, giving me this unprecedented happiness that seemed to last not only in seconds. Seeing the elation Kandiah acquired and realizing how I gave her the podium to creatively share her knowledge to the community, it\\'s utterly fulfilling to understand how\\\\u2013for that brief period in the timeline\\\\u2013I have engendered an impact to Kandiah\\'s story\\\\u2013and together, we\\'ve impacted our readers.

It\\'s honestly more\\\\u2013a cross-collaboration network where like-minded delegates around the globe can come together and synergistically diverge our impact in educating those who don\\'t have access to resources to discover international relations. This is our MUN for Everyone. This is the collaborative impact I love to initiate. This is the genuine warmth I love to create. This is social innovation. This is my passion.MUN for Everyone has altered my perception on happiness. I was constrained to answer my daily urge of self-euphoria, to now discover how the beauty of life flourishes within initiating euphoria to the stories of others. I learned how the resolution to my question may not even be an answer, but the right question\\\\u2013because only then will I write the next chapter to my story.

Hurt momentarily clouds his eyes, but his excitement soon returns once he rejoins the chaos of the parade. As the surrounding clamor of drag queens and rainbow motorcycles drifts into my periphery, a desperate isolation overcomes me. This march is my community\\'s grandest welcome party\\\\u2014the epitome of acceptance\\\\u2014yet why do I feel like an excluded spectator? Shouldn\\'t my rainbow flag also be fluttering in the air, not neatly furled beneath my jacket?My gnawing guilt feels all too familiar. It\\'s what I first experienced when I spotted Jethro, then a freshman, in the school parking lot. While half of me basked in awe of his high heels and rainbow bandana, my other half suffered a creeping discomfort. Dad, expectedly, only expressed the latter.\\'Look, I know you\\'re different too...but you\\'re not that different right?\\'\\'No, of course not.\\'\\'Good.\\'As having just come out as gay, that fleeting conversation warped my self-perception. It solidified an arbitrary line between acceptable and detestable, leading me struggling to display idealized teenage masculinity. Instead of culinary documentaries, football. Gardening and watercolors became hobbies of history. I knew I succumbed to internalized homophobia, but conformity provided security. I preferred feeling confused and deprived to facing any negativity from expressing myself candidly.Thankfully, Jethro entered my life again\\\\u2014this time on Instagram, where he passionately rebuked discriminatory comments. I attempted a facade of indifference, but subconsciously I resonated with his vulnerability and\\\\u2014surprisingly\\\\u2014courage. When he concluded with \\'We have nothing to be sorry for,\\' I actually started to believe it.That millisecond of empowerment slowly became a feeling I craved. Thus, I ventured into the world of activism, but since my initial anxieties lingered, I remained anonymous. Through storytelling, I connected with others who confronted similar difficulties, writing and sharing blog posts about my social experiences. When my city back-lashed against California\\'s new LGBTQ+-inclusive sexual education curriculum, I interviewed dozens of students on identity to compile their voices into a magazine, weaving together narratives of mental health, sexuality, and self-acceptance. Did it obliterate homophobia? No. But it certainly revealed perspectives that had been suppressed for too long. I was honestly proud of my project, yet I still obscured my name and story due to fear.The blare of horns drags me back to the present, and suddenly, I realize this march might be my final chance to escape hypocrisy and reclaim my activism. I urge others to live freely, but how can I do so when I shudder at the thought of being recognized with a rainbow flag?Here and now, I must accept that being gay does define me. Not as being predisposed to enjoy art and horticulture, but through my journey towards self-acceptance, I have gained a refined sensitivity to the struggles of others. I listen, I understand, and when others are lost, I extend my own experiences to empathize with their hardships. These qualities all contribute to my ability to tell compelling stories, a cornerstone of activism, but detached from their authors, stories are just hollow words. To truly empower others in the future, especially those in silence like I was, I can\\'t shy away from the spotlight. I must let all my readers know that I am a tangible individual who is unashamed to exude my story truthfully.Before releasing my first real \\'About Me\\' blog post, I unzip my jacket and reveal my flag. Uplifted by my thrill of starting a new chapter, my arm reaches higher into the canopy of confetti, and I stare wondrously at the colors rippling above. Finally, I feel no more doubt and no more fear: I break free from the sidelines and joyously clasp the next hand offered.I am a staunch opponent of the belief \\'Stick to your passions early.\\' At best, this advice is idealistic, and at worst, it limits exploration. When I first volunteered as a science instructor at a local elementary school, this dogma was rampant, rigidifying curriculum and intimidating students.As cofounder and Director of Outreach of the non-profit organization Stemnova, I sought to eliminate the walls that suffocated STEM education. By our second year, I grew ambitious. I was determined to take steps to reinvent local perceptions of science bigger than the small fundraisers and science nights we had organized before.Thus, Stemnova partnered with the state Science Olympiad organization to host the first student-run tournament on the West Coast. Although our mission was daunting, I knew it was key to proving to our community that science is not compartmentalized. The competition committee I organized creatively planned each event down to the finest detail. For epidemiology, we incorporated novel computer models; for chemistry, we devised labs inspired by botany and nutritional sciences, and for experimental design, we blended together physics and biology. Each minute of the tournament was a sacred chance to exhibit the applicability and interdisciplinary nature of science.By the invitational\\'s end, it was evident our purpose reached the students - at least half their questions for our professional guest speakers linked together various scientific fields. Though some parents still seemed confused, I was content that we had influenced the minds that mattered the most. The awards ceremony was an revelatory moment. Not only did I recognize the current impacts of my leadership, but I also began to envision what my innovative potential could bring in the future - an unbounded educational landscape. I felt empowered by both the students\\' excitement and my volunteers\\' own devotions to materializing something we had initially struggled to define. Our competition was a first for many, and I am still proud of myself and my team for devising an experience that broadened the next generation\\'s understandings and encouraged their once suppressed desire to explore.Like an unscratchable itch, the Finite Heartbeat Theory tugs constantly at my curiosities. Its hypothesis is simple - we have a predetermined number of heartbeats. When my half-pseudoscientist, half-biology teacher first exclaimed this to our class years ago, my seventh-grade self believed it wholeheartedly.By ninth grade, I feared the heart. With Grandpa passing away from a heart attack and my teacher\\'s words still echoing in my head, I viewed the heart as a ticking time bomb. From my apprehension, however, spawned a cautious interest towards cardiology: I was perpetually haunted by the question \\'How many heartbeats left?\\'My concerns brought me into the Priest Laboratory for Pediatric Cardiology through the Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer Research Program. Hoping to characterize diabetes\\' effects on prenatal heart development, I dissected fetal hearts and submerged them in toxic, diabetic conditions overnight.The next morning, as I examined the petri dish with a microscope, I could barely grapple with what I saw - the hearts still beat, oblivious to their caustic surroundings. What I once perceived as a doomed organ suddenly transformed into a vessel of resilience. Before, my interest in cardiology was rooted in foreboding, but, now, it stemmed from a newfound appreciation for the heart\\'s endurance despite adversary. My epiphany spawned fresh queries and perspectives. As I reminisced my Grandpa\\'s own passing, I refused to anxiously calculate how many heartbeats he used. Instead, I began to inquire how I could better the lives of my parents, remembering my own father\\'s cardiovascular disease.These questions led me to where I am today, researching pediatric cardiology in the Priest Lab and observing cardiac stem cell therapy in the Wu Lab. Every day, my work, from cultivating cells to evaluating genetic data, is inspired by my faith in the heart\\'s tenacity, and through pursuing cardiology, I have sharpened my experimental acumen and diversified my scientific skillset. Occasionally, I still ponder over the truth of the Finite Heartbeat Theory, but I always arrive at the same conclusion - with limited heartbeats, I better seize opportunity now and fully dedicate myself to understanding the heart\\'s complexity.Since childhood, I have always been fascinated with the Wubble Bubble. It was simple yet entertaining - its tinted surface humorously distorting my friend\\'s whispers as they floated through the ball to my ear. While my Wubble Bubble now remains deflated in my garage, my fascination with bubbles is still very much afloat. Fortunately - or unfortunately as I have come to recognize - I don\\'t have to look far to find one. In fact, I live in one.In middle school, I loved my Bay Area bubble, grateful that it shielded my community\\'s pride parades and cultural celebrations. However, I grew complacent despite the emerging discrimination in our communities. In early 2018 when California released a more progressive sexual education curriculum, I was snapped out of this illusion. Watching the school board meeting livestream, with its homophobic undertones and disregard for mental health, shocked me. That night, I felt anxious yet impassioned. Being gay myself, I was terrified at the thought of being an outcast, but, simultaneously, I was angry that my identity was considered \\'inappropriate\\' to share. A newfound fervor subsequently overtook me, and with my yearbook experience and the design talent of my friend, I sought to create a magazine to highlight the neglected voices of Fremont\\'s youth. We originally intended to only focus on sexuality, but soon after interviewing dozens of students, we broadened our project to illuminate stories of body positivity, depression, stress, and abusive relationships. Titled \\'Miscellany,\\' our magazine both distributed overlooked narratives to an audience and served as an outlet for emotional release for its contributors. It fostered empathy as it circulated in classrooms and homes, and I am still inspired by accounts from my closest friend\\'s brother that less and less students at his elementary school are using once-prevalent homophobic language.Today, frankly, I am not sure how many individuals have flipped through my magazine - maybe hundreds, perhaps thousands. But I do know that even if only one person reads one story, that is still an important step towards spotlighting shrouded perspectives and solidifying the foundations for a more accepting Fremont.The first time I ever heard a recording of my debate speech, it was torture. It was less what I said, but more how I said it. My voice, both nasal and high-pitched, was excruciating to the ear, and immediately, what I once overlooked bolted to the forefront of my insecurities.In high school, with everyone changing, my distinct voice brought along with it belittling stereotypes: each \\'What\\'s up with you high voice?\\' and \\'Your voice is gay\\' cornered me into silence and isolation. Competing in debate only amplified my anxiety, so futilely, I practiced diaphragm stretches and speaking exercises to deepen my voice. These activities were distractions from reading and developing cases, but I committed to them anyway, leading to a tragic string of losses.Junior year, before a national tournament, my voice disappeared. Sounding like a whelping animal during my vocal exercises, my fear quickly evolved into resignation. Since I couldn\\'t speak, I spent my night determinedly researching instead, half hoping that maybe I could win on the premise of knowledge.That weekend, even with my relentless coughing, my partner and I advanced into the top thirty-two. Though we received just a flimsy certificate, it meant so much more to me as it was the first tangible evidence that challenged my insecurities. While my fingers ran along the paper, I realized what had distinguished this tournament was that I had actually focused on something changeable - my knowledge - instead of a constant factor. Before, my self-consciousness blinded me from spotting any actual opportunities for growth.Today, my voice is a reminder of my own resilience and adaptability. From this struggle, I have come to grasp the importance of perspective in learning, that I should focus on malleable factors to propel myself forward. This process of overcoming my linear thinking has influenced me to constantly reevaluate my problems and identify affectable areas of improvement: self-improvement is only achievable through reason and passion. Now, I am no longer concerned about my voice. Instead, I am driven to use it as a powerful tool to better engage my curiosities.\"}, {\"index\": 60, \"new_personal_statement\": \"As a child in Shanghai, I loved navigating the patternless paths of open-air markets with my grandmother, searching for bamboo shoots or daikon radishes. After moving to California, I missed the hustle and bustle of the markets, but rediscovered the same organic and animate nature of food in the community garden.Richly crinkled lettuces, jewel-toned lupines\\\\u2026 In this vibrant and lush oasis, gardeners from all over my city craft verdant masterpieces in the freedom of their own 20x20 foot squares. On summer nights\\\\u2014my favorite time to visit\\\\u2014the mist from the hoses carried on the breeze mingles with the fragrance of the flowers and washes away the dust of the hot day.Every visit is a revelation. Many of the gardeners have been gardening for longer than I\\'ve been alive, and it\\'s from them that I\\'ve learned the perfect mix of manure for growing the sweetest tomatoes and the best time to sow squash seeds. These tidbits of wisdom give me a more profound understanding of nature than any biology class: when the soil becomes miraculously fertile after growing legumes, I get to witness nitrogen fixation firsthand.Ultimately, what I enjoy most about the community garden is\\\\u2026 the community. Although I spend so much time there, I don\\'t actually have a plot. Rather, I walk the wood-chip paths, lending a hand here and there, transplanting seedlings and mulching rows. From planting monarch waystations to building raised garden beds for seniors, sharing my time has allowed me make friends with people from down the street and from across town, across generational and cultural divides. I snip zucchinis for the friendly mustachioed cooks at La Comida, the soup kitchen, while we trade recipes. The woman in the wheelchair watering tomatoes? I\\'ve become her dog sitter. The middle-aged man pulling weeds? We debate politics. On the surface, we may not share much in common, but in the garden\\'s rich soil, I\\'ve established my own roots that allow me to tap into their complex and dynamic stories.The garden brought me closer to my community, but I never expected it to also bring me closer to home. I\\'ve realized that, at the unobservable pace at which plants grow, it takes patience and persistence to nurture a tiny seed into a plant. When my father was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, I had to call upon that resilience I had learned at the garden not only to care for him, but also to support the rest of my family on the long nights when my parents were at the hospital. I did everything I could: I cooked meals, looked after my brother, and even got a job when my dad lost his. But what meant the most to me was introducing him to my beloved garden. Every day after dinner, my father and I would walk there together. As we strolled the lavender-lined paths, I\\'d point out the new budding vegetables and we\\'d talk about all the golf courses he\\'d play when he gets better. For me, I was sharing the place I love: my source of strength, where I feel most grounded and connected to the humble brilliance of nature. For my father, the garden reconnected him to life outside the hospital, one of exercise, fresh air, and the sound of crickets on a warm summer night. The growing buds represented more encouragement for tomorrow than words could ever say.Through the seedlings I planted and fences I mended, I learned that community isn\\'t just the borders on a map within which we live. It\\'s an empathy that extends beyond merely understanding others or making small talk. As I go on to join new groups and communities, I will always make the effort to find common ground beneath surface similarities. While we all have unique backgrounds and perspectives, it\\'s the bonds between us, the sympathetic tendrils entwining our lives closer, that hold the community together.When my dad was diagnosed with cancer , I set a goal for myself to incorporate healthier habits into my family\\'s lifestyle. To learn more about the wellness resources that my community offers, I attended the XXX City Health Fair. However, to my disappointment, I found the fair to be quite boring. The vendor booths offered assisted living services and chair zumba classes, and coincidentally, most of the visitors were above age 60. Although the health fair was meant to serve the whole city, only a small fraction of the population attended. My disappointment quickly turned into a desire to connect with my diverse community and inspire others take charge of their own health. So after asking how to help, I began working with the health fair planning committee. However, as time went on, I couldn\\'t help but notice that the planning discussions, like the fair itself, lacked the perspective of someone from the left end of the age spectrum. In order for the fair to attract a younger audience, I needed to identify the health issues that are most pressing to youth in my city. At the same time, I wanted to create more opportunities for my peers to engage with their community in a meaningful way. Therefore, I partnered with health-oriented student-run clubs and non-profits, such as Project Safety Net and Youth Community Service, for teen leaders to give presentations about their organizations\\' missions and use the platform of the fair\\'s vendor booths to attract others to their cause. I also worked with my school\\'s debate team to stage a student debate in the City Council Chambers, with the topic of which health issues were important to teens. It was amazing to work alongside fellow students to build community and create a positive impact.I am proud to say that the following year\\'s health fair attracted not only younger visitors, but also more visitors in general. After listening to guest speakers and participating in fitness classes, many students came up to me and asked me how they could volunteer! Moreover, the professional arguments made by my debate teammates gave adults a new perspective on teen health issues, and audience members were so engaged that the debate was opened up to a public forum. Overall, planning the health fair gave me the skills, perspectives, and motivation to advocate for issues that are important to me and make a difference in my community.I\\'ve played piano for the past 13 years, but while I can infuse pieces with my own emotions, I\\'m still limited by the rigid notes on the page. Rather, developing original music has become the most energizing expression of my creativity.I began improvising in middle school through playing Baroque music from composers like Bach. With figured-bass notation, or guidelines to chord progressions, players must spontaneously play different chord inversions. Despite how nerve-wracking it is to simultaneously read music and harmonically analyze it, I love the freedom in designing my own musical narratives. While doubling triad-notes emphasizes tonality, subtle 7th-notes convey ominous tones. With these nuances, I can tell unique stories with every performance.In high school, while taking AP Music Theory, I started using composition softwares like Noteflight and LogicPro. Tinkering on my laptop with one hand while trying out piano melodies with the other, I composed classical-style pieces like chorales and fugues. Inventing new cadences and progressions was enjoyable, but my curiosity led me to explore alternative genres like ragtime and electronic-dance. Soon, I was composing everything from podcast music to movie theme songs. My creations found their way into other areas of my life; my ambient music became the centerpiece of an AP Psychology project on sensory perception. The soundscapes add atmosphere, but also are immersively-interactive examples of sensory adaptation because listeners unconsciously remember note-sequences.This unconventional application of my work sparked my obsession with integrating music and multimedia performances. I\\'m an avid film-scorer, collaborating with my school\\'s film students, and channel my unfettered creativity into revitalizing dull punchlines or adding intensity to jump-scares. Sitting in the studio with headphones on, I\\'m keenly aware of the delicate interdependence between visual and musical elements. Every emotion, action-point, and symbol is carefully reflected; the music and plot crescendos and decrescendos in unison.My interest in music began with its immense freedom in self-expression, but I\\'ve also gained an appreciation for how its creativity can connect diverse mediums. From improvising to composing to film-scoring, my musical journey has taught me that my mind will always sharp and ready to invent.After moving from Shanghai to California, I missed navigating the patternless paths of open-air markets.

As I\\'ve grown, my love for adventure found a more practical channel\\\\u2014biology. But as much as I enjoy bushwhacking, globetrotting voyages, I\\'m no Darwin, fascinated by evolution\\'s protracted vastness. Me? I\\'m drawn to the infinitesimals. The molecular machinery of life is thrilling: how do cells deploy antibody weaponry or aggregate into organs? To better understand these processes, I pursued AP Biology, AP Chemistry, and AP Statistics, courses foundational to investigating scientific mysteries. Serving as a peer tutor in the Student Resource Center, I shared my passion with my classmates through developing weekly lesson plans.Beyond school, I engage my curiosities with the freedom and open-endedness of research. At the Institute of Myeloma and Bone Cancer, I adapted my adventuring skills to measuring novel cancer-biomarkers. As I progressed from merely following protocols to designing my own experiments, I began to understand how individual macromolecules drive complex biological processes like cancer proliferation. The abstracts I co-authored during the internship are published in Blood Journal and presented at the 2017 American Society of Hematologists Annual Meeting. Hooked on the excitement of discovery, I then interned at (XXX University) Bioengineering to probe the mysteries of the brain\\'s biomechanics. Through inertial-sensor-fitted mouthguards, I monitored XXX University athletes\\' neurotrauma, realizing the limits of the human body and the consequences of breaking them. Currently, I am employed as a research assistant at the XXX Lab in XXX Medicine. Working on multiple projects under different postdocs to elucidate functions of RNA genes, I\\'m reminded of the countless perspectives and possibilities in science. While one researcher uses live mouse models, another uses biocomputational algorithms to map the same genes. My diverse research experiences demonstrated biology\\'s immense creation-potential, which I further explored in XXX University\\'s XXX Summer Program. From coding Arduino processors to build heart-rate sensors, to simulating respiratory emergencies with virtual reality, I was exposed to biology\\'s innumerable facets relating to other fields. As a future researcher, I hope to continue studying and improving the world around me. Whether it\\'s fantastical jungles or spiraling DNA, my inquisitiveness and enthusiasm drive me to explore, never slowing down.\"}, {\"index\": 61, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Amidst a hundred or so 5th graders sitting on beige and off-black tiles in a compact gymnasium, my chubby self turns to my best (okay, only) friend as middle school giants stroll in with their equipment and shimmering doohickeys. He looks back at me with enthusiasm, expecting a show. We feast our eyes on the lengthiest instrument they possess: the trombone. The man behind the brass tubing riffs out an awesomely obnoxious ostinato. It was at that moment we contemplated participating in band and jamming on the trombone together.Little did I know this decision would determine who I am today.My life hit an abrupt accelerando. At this age, I legitimately believed I had no significant talent or extracurricular interests. When I spoke during class or at lunch, my classmates harassed me for being Hispanic and having only one talent: eating a whole heap of Doritos. However, this entertaining performance lit up a light bulb in my head.After the middle school band preview, I met face-to-face with the only obstacles in the way of transforming my person: forms, fees, and my father. My parents were boggled about why I wanted to be in this program; no one in my family had ever picked up an instrument. Feeling courageous enough following a pep talk with my close friend, I toddled to my father and mother to tell them I wanted to do band\\\\u2026 and then the allegro of the symphony of my adolescence began.In middle school, myriad sounds transformed my world, and the trombone often called to me with its waa-waa song. The cantabile sound drew me in and kept me coming back to music. I refined my technique and took part in the jazz ensemble, my first after school activity! This extracurricular led to my admiration for jazz music, consequently influencing my habitual scat singing. Most importantly, I met a group of individuals who voluntarily united to share something they love: music. I finally felt as if I were a part of a community.I play trombone\\\\u2014that\\'s the first thing I tell people when they want to know about me. I\\'m pleased to say that the trombone is anentity that defines me.Transitioning to high school, I met new challenges to my abilities and new opportunities to make music, to milk ballads and to blast down walls. While performing the climax of Elsa\\'s Procession to the Cathedral at the Chicago Symphony Center Orchestra Hall, my sound was so robust that my body continued to shake until after I put my instrument away. High school also threw me into a larger, more diverse pool of students, which meant easy access to new friends and perspectives. I became a dedicated member of the music program, taking on leadership roles in various groups. I learned teamwork. That a sound must blend or rise over other sounds,that I depend on others as they depend on me to sustain the harmony of a piece.As much fun as I had in band, there were aspects of the band program that taught me tolerance and patience. The money due every year feltexorbitant, and there were always smaller fees in the form of surprises throughout the year. The cost was discouraging, especially to my family. I thought repeatedly of quitting.I stayed in band despite the cost, minor frustrations, and overwhelming time commitment. During my experience in band, I picked up more than just an instrument, because band shaped me to become cooperative and perceptive.I wouldn\\'t have discovered my voice without this interest. Without music, my world is blank. It\\'s black and white. As Plato declared, music is what \\'gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything.\\' It\\'s what made me Memo.Sitting on an inviting carpet, chubby, bushy eye-browed 4-year-old Memo grasps an alien spaceship-looking controller and joins his older brother in taking in the vibrant colors of the CRT television as the song of adventure and wave file fanfares fills the room. Mario Party 2 for the Nintendo 64 was one of the first videogames I ever played, and from time to time, I still find myself resuming the adventure. There are worlds out there to explore; whenever I need to step away from the stress and pressure of reality, I play a quick game with my brothers or friends.\"}, {\"index\": 62, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I have tried to escape the truth, justify my actions, and run away from what I do. I am the bane of people\\'s existence, a scapegoat for the world\\'s collective anger. I am most people\\'s arch-nemesis. I am incorrigible. I am ruthless. I am a cold-caller for a political campaign.While often reviled\\\\u2013 there is a near universal hatred for solicitors\\\\u2013 I believe the act of cold-calling is beautiful: a brilliantly choreographed performance which pairs quick thinking with resourcefulness, salesmanship with logic, and above all, persistence with even more persistence. While I would rarely label my phone calls as \\'fun\\', through the thousands of calls I have made soliciting support, volunteers, and money for three political campaigns around Phoenix, I have learned three invaluable lessons which have been integral to my maturation.Lesson 1: be comfortable being uncomfortable. When I make a call, I have two options: regurgitate my cold and robotic script, or open up and try to connect with complete strangers in a few seconds. While the latter is far more successful, it is much harder because when I broadcast my passions, I simultaneously become vulnerable to personal rejection. However, to make a successful cold-call, I learned I must reveal the truest form of myself. I have used this lesson during my time as the president of my school\\'s stock market club, where I have committed myself to go beyond simply teaching our members about the intricacies of stocks and markets. I hope to inspire them with my passion and positive attitude to love the topic as I do, and as a result, membership has almost doubled from previous years. My calls have proven that being vulnerable, while inherently uncomfortable, is essential.Lesson 2: seize the moment. When making calls, I am given ten seconds of attention before I am either tuned out or hung up on. I can either seize opportunities when they present themselves, or hesitate and fail. I am rarely afforded the luxury to dance around my goal, and as a result, I have learned to read a situation and take decisive action because if I stop to doubt my abilities, I will be pitching to a dial tone. This lesson proved valuable to me when my bosses at the Arizona Democratic Party asked me to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in front of thousands of people during the Phoenix 2016 Michelle Obama rally. Despite my abject terror at the prospect of speaking in front of that many people, my calls taught me to immediately accept their offer because I knew this opportunity would never come again. My calls have shown me I must be confident in myself and capitalize on opportunities if I want success.Lesson 3: perseverance is believing success is always just around the corner. In my cold-calling circles, we always had one saying which encapsulated our experience: \\'It\\'s always the next call.\\' I had been on streaks of dozens of hangups, refusals, or disconnected numbers, but no matter how bad the calls before had been, I remained motivated to make the extra call because I knew it only took one success to turn our fortunes around and potentially win the election. For some context, my first experience in politics was on the 2016 Clinton campaign, and my second campaign was on a state race, both of which ended in catastrophic failure. I could have easily quit, but my relentless salesmanship allowed me to join yet another campaign because I know my latest attempt would change everything.I won\\'t pretend I valued my cold-calling as much then as I do retrospectively. Each refusal, mean-spirited remark, or hang-up stung\\\\u2013 when you do something that often, it is hard to take failure as anything but personal. However, I am immensely proud I never hung up the metaphorical gloves and literal phone because each call helped me better define my work ethic.\"}, {\"index\": 63, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'I don\\'t really see the point of your product. Why don\\'t you make something more useful, like vitamin juice?\\'Our advisor at MIT Launch cut us off and shot down our idea of a transparent and water-soluble pill for kids within minutes. She suggested that we make vitamin juice instead. When one of my teammates politely pointed out that Coca-Cola already made Vitamin Water, she replied, \\'Well, you can always make up grounds with marketing. You know, like VHS vs. BetaMax.\\'Some of us didn\\'t know what a VHS was much less a BetaMax, but we got the point. Our idea was not viable. Distraught, we exited the room, and meandered silently until we saw a bench at a nearby park. One member suggested that we follow the instructor\\'s idea so that we wouldn\\'t fall behind, while another suggested that we stick to our original idea. Amidst the discussion, I felt a compelling need to ask this question: if it weren\\'t for the deadlines, did we really want to make vitamin juice?No one. Exactly. With that question, I exposed the inconvenient truth that everybody else was too afraid to acknowledge. How could we market a product we weren\\'t even sold on? What our advisor wanted was a real problem and a viable idea, not necessarily vitamin juice. We decided to work off of her suggestions and find a new idea that energized us.The next few days, all sorts of ideas, old and new, began to bounce off of each other. We felt pressured because we were behind other teams, but we decided to work at our own pace. We were determined to find a relatable problem that needed a viable solution; we refused to work on an idea that didn\\'t excite us.One day, when I shared a story about my two mischievous cousins, an idea suddenly popped up in our heads. It wasn\\'t just medicine that kids didn\\'t like, but a slew of things, from brushing their teeth to cleaning up their rooms. Suddenly everyone started to contribute. What if it was their friend who told them to brush their teeth? What if the friend was a plush? What if the plush was connected to the parent\\'s cell phone through an Arduino chip? The ideas came pouring in, and we landed on Penny the Penguin, which parents can connect to an app to craft messages that the penguin would share verbally. We began to work on it right away, with two members working on the business plan, one on design, and me on coding. After many sleepless nights, we were no longer behind other groups.It was now time for the final pitch. In a room full of teams who made heart monitoring devices, motion-activated anti-theft devices, and other inventions, we pitched a penguin plush. To our surprise; however, Penny was a smashing hit. We received love-calls from venture capitalists, startup experts, and university professors. Our advisor was proud that we listened to her feedback. We appeared on StartupTVBoston, and we may even appear on Shark Tank Season 10. But more importantly, I was proud of our team for not succumbing to the pressure of \\'falling behind\\' and finding a problem that mattered to us.Later, I gave Penny as a gift to my cousins, who instantly fell in love with it. My aunt was even more thrilled, as she gained an ally who agreed that kids should eat before they go out and brush their teeth before bed. As I observed my cousins playing with Penny, I learned that it\\'s natural to feel pressured in an environment where others might seem smarter or faster than you. Through the making of Penny, I found that I would never succumb to pressure in search for the right direction. Often in life, velocity is more important than speed\\\\u2014since velocity being a vector has direction, while speed does not.\"}, {\"index\": 64, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I began my hike, expecting to return feeling freer and possibly fitter, but instead I returned in a half-dazed state; lost in thought about the \\'rainbow nation\\' of South Africa and if it existed at all.The sky was azure blue, a color so deep it was both mesmerizing and disconcerting. As I continued forward, passing more informal settlements, I noticed how the mountain\\'s rough surface echoed the remains of a broken society. Surrounding me was the underdeveloped ruins of Apartheid. With each meter I hiked, my idealized view of the world evaporated into thin air.Mandela, wise and saintly, united a nation. This is the history that South African students, like myself, are taught. I always believed that 1994 was a revolutionary year in which the \\'new South Africa,\\' the rainbow nation, was born. Growing up in the midst of a swirling pot of ethnicities and languages, I foolishly assumed that unity and equality were inherent in diversity. Although South Africa is diverse, I\\'ve come to realize that our rainbow is one where the colors rarely meet. The physical distance between different groups of society is minuscule but the socioeconomic divide is vast. Every day that I travel to school is a jarring reminder of this divide as I come face to face with beggars separated only by a piece of glass. Yet, this transparent material, while physically breakable, highlights the impenetrable social divide in South Africa.The wealthy do not engage with the poor unless the poor are providing them a service. I, too, was guilty of this. While I hiked past the local people living in shacks made of scraps of corrugated iron, I did not speak with them despite the fact that they were the same people who chopped firewood for my family each autumn break. I felt mortified that for most of my life I had been complicit in the rift in South African society.This realization spurred me to take action to improve South Africa\\'s defective education system, a primary root of this social inequality, in which most children lack access to educational facilities and, occasionally, do not even receive textbooks. For the past two years, I have run a Mathematics program for underprivileged children with the hope of combating structural inequalities in the education sector, while also lessening the socially imposed barriers that had defined my upbringing. Through this project, I was able to engage with children whose circumstances were completely unlike my own. I taught Bavu, a refugee from the Congo, and Sam, who did not want to be a domestic worker like her mother and grandmother, but who wanted to become a doctor. Sam and Bavu impressed upon me that it is not unchosen factors such as background that characterize us, but rather our ability to look past our circumstances that truly defines us. Just as Sam and Bavu worked to overcome their underprivileged circumstances, I too could rise above my own heritage as a descendant of Apartheid supporters. I did not have to allow my family\\'s history to define my future. I refuse to follow my ancestor\\'s footsteps, choosing compassion over hatred.This hike wasn\\'t my first exposure to poverty. It did, however, mark a period of reevaluation in which I realized that the term \\'rainbow nation\\' is a mere disguise which promotes ignorance above the recognition of the vast separatism and social inequality prevalent in South Africa. I realized that I do not want to be another set of footprints over the same paths; I want to reroute South Africa\\'s path towards an equal, just and integrated society. I am not nai\\\\u0308ve enough to believe that conversations with strangers of different races, classes and belief systems are enough to revolutionize a country, but, as I begin to build connections with people vastly different to myself, I slowly begin to blur the harsh lines which divide the rainbow nation.\"}, {\"index\": 65, \"new_personal_statement\": \"To say that my family loves books would be an understatement. My father, a Nigerian immigrant and self-proclaimed Renaissance man, was a being of great words and even greater ideas. From his college years in Lagos to his 50s in America, he had gathered a reservoir of newspaper articles, school gossip columns, books about patriots, books about self-proclaimed gods, and books about superheroes. His days were spent either in front of the computer, or exploring the world for inspiration. He would sit us down several times, my older siblings and I, and read from his manuscripts. His words were an oasis, rejuvenating us and adding moisture to a world that otherwise felt dry. Although I didn\\'t understand much of his vocabulary \\\\u2014 he was smart, I was not smart \\\\u2014 it instilled in me a desire for imagination, and I then knew I wanted to love books as much as my dad loved books.However, my eyes were not yet revealed to the grand scope of reading until I met the words on the computer screen: Starfall. At this point in my childhood, I was six or seven, already used to the lifestyle of reading picture books and hearing Fisher Price\\'s Little People: ABC Sing-Along from start to finish about a hundred times. However, I had never known that there was a website like Starfall hiding from me all these years. I had never known that my brother and older sister had already moved on from the ABC Sing-Along to read on this website. I had never known that anything other than the ABC Sing-Along could teach me about the alphabet. Suddenly, I began to realize how limited my knowledge was in comparison to my siblings\\'. They were smart. I was not smart. My siblings, seeing the uncertainty on my face, guided me through the website, navigating through the ABC section, the Learning to Read section, the All About Me section, and numerous other secrets. I learned that Zac the Rat is clumsy with jam and that Peg the Hen shouldn\\'t have a pilot license. I learned that Fuzzy Wuzzy is quite possibly the hardest tongue twister known to man and that King Midas could have made a lot of cash with his awesome super power. But most of all, I learned that reading was no longer an oasis, but rather a universe, vast and gigantic in magnitude. I was a shooting star, roaming beyond what I thought was possible. All I had to do was reach for the heavens.So when my little sister reached an appropriate reading age \\\\u2014 I was eleven or twelve \\\\u2014 I sat her down in front of the computer and typed in the URL. Her doll eyes lit up as colors exploded in her face, starstruck with the numerous opportunities within her reach. My older siblings were beside us, watching me as I guided her through the website the same way they had for me. As we read the first story of Zac the Rat, my little sister had trouble with the words. She quickly became frustrated, and almost quit after struggling for a while. But instead of letting her leave and doodle on paper, I kept her on that seat and made her keep going. The stars were waiting for her. The universe was waiting for her. Her rocket only needed fuel, and I wanted to be the one to help her get some. Because she was smart, and I was smart.\\'20 seconds!\\' My dad\\'s eyes were glued to the time on the screen.My sister Sarah chimed in. \\'That starts with an S, I know it!\\'\\'Something road trip!\\' I screamed. The three of us racked our brains for some sort of answer. My other sister Urenna peered in and, after thinking she said, \\'Surprise road trip?\\'A silence passed until realization hit us. \\'Yes!\\' We glanced at the time. 10 seconds. Pandemonium ensued as my dad sped on the keyboard, my sisters cheered him on, and I counted down the seconds. \\'5. 4. 3. 2\\\\u2026.\\' This last summer, my father was acting strange. He spent his entire day on his phone, occasionally hollering with joy. This wasn\\'t new; periodically he\\'d find a game and obsess over it for months. But when Dad\\'s behavior was accompanied by sounds from my favorite game show, my curiosity was piqued, and he finally revealed what enraptured him: the Wheel of Fortune mobile app.At once, one victim became two.The game took over our lives. Whenever Dad needed help, I, the quote-unquote Wheel of Fortune prodigy, solved the puzzles without breaking a single sweat. However, as the puzzles became harder, I wasn\\'t as effortless. My father thought to invite more help, but I refused. Prodigies didn\\'t need help; they were help. But when I couldn\\'t get an answer, Dad went ahead and invited my sister. Sarah breezed through the puzzles, and I became frustrated, first at Sarah for stealing my thunder, then at my father, and then at myself. I felt useless, and eventually I left the game behind.That was, until one day Sarah called me into the kitchen. Entering, I found her and Dad scratching their heads, ruminating over the puzzle before them. When she spotted me, Sarah pointed at the screen. I hesitated, remembering my past failures. But when Sarah didn\\'t falter, I looked at the phone. 26 letters. Four words. \\'All-you-can-eat restaurant?\\'  I said. Dad entered it and as the phone burst into cheering, the three of us jumped and screamed with joy.I eventually returned to the game. In the success of our collaboration, I found there was no way I could do it on my own. The whole family gradually joined in, and I was fine with it because I knew asking was better than struggling alone.I still call myself the prodigy, though. That hasn\\'t changed.As a little kid, I was expected to get good grades, go to a nice college, and become a rich doctor. I was one of those kids who only wanted to do medicine because my parents said to. However, that changed in 2011. My 5th grade year, I saw my health deteriorate right before my eyes. It started with chest pains, then weakness, until finally I collapsed at my school.At the hospital, I was diagnosed with pneumonia. I went through my first urine test, my first x-ray, and eventually my first hospitalization, and although I recovered within a day, I saw for the first time what healthcare was really like. Before, doctors and nurses were just nice adults who measured your height and weight. But afterwords, hospitals to me became a lot more than check-ups. They were places for treatment, for emergencies, for hope, for death. And I wanted to be in every part of it.After 5th grade, I wanted to save lives, and with Northwestern being a champion for medicine, it became my dream to attend this school. Though it will be a while before I apply for medical school, Northwestern ensures I have the right foundation through undergraduate research opportunities as well as Pre-Med Advising to keep me on the right track. Northwestern also provides a multitude of resources students can utilize. From libraries storing priceless archives to museums solely dedicated to the arts, I can expand my knowledge beyond the classroom and delve into subjects that genuinely interest me.In this day and age, it is innovation that drives the field of medicine. We need more doctors guided by compassion, and by attending Northwestern I wish to gain the skills necessary to instill hope in my patients the same way those doctors had for me.When I was 11 years old, my family travelled to Disney World. Although the vacation itself was frustrating due to my parents inability to plan an itinerary, I found myself falling in love. Not with Mickey Mouse, if that is what you are thinking (he has a girlfriend!) No, I was in love with Florida.Before then, I knew nothing about the state. I imagined the state to be an island paradise where the sun always shines, hurricanes appear 24/7, and people have crocodiles for neighbors. While Florida was none of those things (missed opportunity on the crocodiles), it was still a wonderland in real life. Florida had more beautiful beaches than any I had seen in Chicago, and the skies were so blue it was almost unnatural. Beyond Disney World, the metropolis of Orlando promised enormous skyscrapers that only God could reach, clear waters, and the presence of a city life that never died.By attending UCF, I have the chance to explore Orlando for what more it has to offer. Being Orlando\\'s hometown university, UCF provides a plethora of activities, social gatherings, and research opportunities that I can access with the bonus of sunny weather. UCF puts its students first and creates an atmosphere where no one is left behind.My trip to Disney World gave me a preview to Orlando\\'s beauty and culture. I cannot wait to come back and get the full taste of this town and the diverse environment championed by UCF.My dad taught me three things. First, any meal that wasn\\'t Nigerian in nature or bought from a fast food chain did not count as \\'food\\' (sorry instant ramen). Second, if an adult wished to watch TV, whether it be the news or the most recent boxing match, there was no chance at negotiation. Third, and perhaps most important, that every moment of my life was at worst a challenge and at best a learning opportunity.I never really understood the first tenet, and the second made me a more hostile person with the remote. However, my father\\'s third lesson stuck with me, and soon it became the basis of my entire personality. I took it to competitions, where I transformed my losses into chances to improve upon my skill set. I took it to relationships with friends and family, where arguments made me sit down and rethink the circumstances from the other person\\'s shoes. But most of all, I utilized my dad\\'s final lesson towards school. Rather than take the easy route, I challenged myself with difficult classes and overzealous projects, even if they brought me more failure than success. The concepts may have been confusing at times, and the coursework was enough to make me rip my hair out. Nevertheless, I thrived in the curriculum that I chose for myself, not because I had an easy time, but because the experience of overcoming a difficult trial was rewarding.Participating in UIC\\'s Honors College would allow me to continue challenging myself. I would have the opportunity to work closely with faculty members, take on intricate research projects, and dedicate more of my time and effort towards developing my intellect. The greatest people in my life told me that genius was 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration, and I aim to put this idea to the test under the intense curriculum of the Honors College.However, education to me is not just about knowledge. It is also about applying said knowledge to the world around me and becoming a leader in my community. By being a part of UIC\\'s Honors College, I am allowed opportunities to coordinate with my fellow peers and provide input into the team effort. I have the chance to share my ideas with others and engage in higher-level discussions that strain our intellects and imaginations. Overall, the Honors College has a platform for my curiosity, and I seek to use that platform to develop my abilities.Thinking back on the rules my dad established, they did not really make any sense. In fact, if anything, they were less of rules and more of special father privileges. However, underneath the random lessons, my father taught me to challenge myself and to advance beyond my boundaries. And I know that by attending the Honors College at UIC, I can develop not only as a student but also as a future doctor and a human being.\\'Watch out for that spear!\\' My brother Chinwendu screamed in my ear. His eyes, bloodshot, were fixed on the TV screen.\\'Way ahead of you,\\' I said. My thumbs slammed on the down button while my avatar ducked and avoided the attack.Chinwendu leaned in closer. His hands squeezed my chair.  \\'What are you doing? Just press left, right\\\\u2014\\'\\'Stop backseat gaming!\\' Shifting around in my seat, I watched my opponent prepare another attack. He swung at me, and I rolled out of the way. My opponent stumbled over, and a grin came upon my face.\\'Now, while his hitbox is open!\\' Chinwendu yelled. Faster than ever before, I strummed my fingers over the controller, inputting a massive combo. Right punch. Left kick. Ice freeze. Shoulder dash. The opponent\\'s HP steadily decreased, and I gave the final blow and uppercutted him. As his defeated body crumpled to the ground, Chinwendu and I cheered, high-fiving each other. Since our childhood, my brother and I have adored fighting video games. When it came to games like Mortal Kombat and Dead or Alive, we were obsessed, spending every moment of our lives either playing them or talking about them. However, our love went beyond the console. We discussed game mechanics, hitboxes, recovery times, and power balancing. We compared combos and strategies, and although it was the nerdiest thing ever, I loved it, both for the excitement of fighting and the fun of indulging my inner geek with my older brother.In Igbo, \\'Ugonna\\' means \\'pride of my father\\'. While only six letters, my name is an important part of who I am, and although it has spent most of its time mispronounced and the butt of relentless jokes, my name is the cornerstone of my willpower and a reminder of the most innate part of my identity:A proud Nigerian.Growing up, I loved everything about my heritage. Food that could light stomachs on fire. Music that could make anyone dance. Even Nollywood films that were so bad they were good. I was fascinated with the culture of my ancestors, and it made me special to know I was part of it.But despite living in a Nigerian family, I never felt truly Nigerian. There were things I didn\\'t know, like speaking Igbo or even the names of the ethnic dishes I ate. In conversations about Nigeria, I found myself lost in the words, knowledge, and memories I lacked. My genes said I was Nigerian, but everything else said I was an imposter.That is, until I found Ethnic Fair.Through this school activity, I contributed to my heritage through performance. I studied music from my culture, danced with moves from my culture, and found a group to share my culture with. I found pride in who I was, and I recognized that, no matter what, I\\'m still Nigerian. I may not know Wizkid or egusi soup, but I\\'m Nigerian, and nobody can tell me otherwise.When my sophomore English class read Frankenstein, there were generally two responses. First, that there were a billion things more interesting than some melodramatic creature yapping at its creator. The second, a bitter compromise where the 256 pages were read only to answer class questions, leading to students forgetting the plot right after. I was none of the above, though I too wasn\\'t immune to the memory loss. While the plot didn\\'t matter to me, what did were the two main characters: the mad scientist and his creation.Growing up, I\\'ve had a soft spot for mad scientists. Where my classmates saw in Frankenstein a self-indulgent man with a disregard for morals, I saw strong intellect and even stronger curiosity. But more intriguing than Frankenstein himself was his monster. He epitomized everything I loved: biology, pseudoscience, and pettiness The Housewives can only dream of. The idea of constructing a human consumed me, and soon my curiosity about the body began to grow. How do cells know to differentiate in structure and function? How can one error in DNA create such catastrophic effects? If human DNA was combined with another animal\\'s, what would be the result?The human body is a complicated puzzle, and like Frankenstein I hope to use my inquiry to search for solutions. It amazes me everyday to see from tiny cells the world as we experience it today, and by attending UCF, my engagement in the field of biology will further my intrigue of the human body.\"}, {\"index\": 66, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Everyone needs a passion: something to pour their heart into, that they can look forward to, that keeps them going after a long week - something they can spend hours on without no other goal than to please themselves. A waste of time, yet time well spent - time that they wouldn\\'t want to invest anywhere else. Something to invigorate them and put their mind at ease. Something they could spend all day talking about and all night thinking about.I got my first camera when I was fifteen. At the time, I didn\\'t even really like photography. I had been offered a trip to China by my school, and I just wanted something better than my phone to document it. I finally settled on a cheap, second-hand camera. In retrospect, it was a bad deal, even used; but when it arrived I was ecstatic. And I certainly got my money\\'s worth. I took 900 shots over that two week trip (50 of which I decided were worth keeping!)Nine hundred became five thousand, and soon every other day was spent shooting pictures. It was comforting to have something to turn to; after every bad grade, after every hard day, a photography session came to help me forget. It was a way to cope, maybe. It felt productive and freeing. I jumped over every hurdle, clicking away on my camera. It was a feeling I wanted to share with the whole world.My school had a photography club. However, it wasn\\'t exactly a sight to behold. We were only 6 members and meetings were short and erratic. I joined several photography communities online but struggled to find one I could call home. The larger groups were elitist and unwelcoming; the smaller ones were niche and inactive. Then, one day, I discovered one I fell in love with. It was a small, dying server with only 10 active members, yet it was an amazing place. Everyone shared a bond based on their love of photography. As far as online communities went, it wasn\\'t necessarily unique. But I knew when I joined that I would never want to leave.And so I posted every day: photos I had taken, articles I found interesting, questions about techniques and advice I had come up with. I became a moderator, then an administrator, and worked with the owner to expand the server. As I became more knowledgeable about photography, I began giving courses to members and holding monthly photography contests. The member count began to grow and has been growing steadily to this day.Lately I don\\'t shoot as much as I used to. I don\\'t have as much time and it somehow feels less fulfilling. However, I relish answering questions on the server, tutoring members, learning how lenses are built, and researching different types of camera sensors. Photography is my passion, a time killer-but never a waste of time. Although I may not be able to fully explain to my friends (or even to myself) why I care so much about it, I know my passion will never die.\"}, {\"index\": 67, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Alexandra\\'s Guide to the Galaxy defines socks as tubular pieces of cloth, sold in sets of two, commonly made of cellulose and water. Their main purpose is to absorb sweat, but my sock drawer holds specimens that rise above the typical calling. On a calm day, they remind me of interesting, even questionable, life decisions, and one particular pair even acts as my antidote to existential crises. With \\'Don\\'t Panic\\' stitched in bright red letters on the soles (a questionable location for potentially life-saving advice), I could have used my tall blue socks in 2006 as I watched my pet turtle, Commodore Fuzzy-Head, perish in a polluted Taipei river. His sacrifice sparked a fascination with environmental law that ultimately led me to my first debate meet as the sole freshman on team of senior boys. Though I was only supposed to observe, an outbreak of strep throat thrust me into the role of last-minute replacement. My coach handed me a sloppily-compiled speech, smeared with whiteout. My team\\'s dejected faces, and my opponents\\' grins of premature victory, said what I already knew: I wasn\\'t the best fit for the topic, \\'the sword is stronger than the pen.\\' I felt my \\'Don\\'t Panic\\' socks sponging up the product of my nerves. Picturing those red letters, I realized the pre-written speech represented the pen, restraints we place on ourselves, our biases and doubts. In that moment, I knew I was the sword. I began with a heartfelt monologue, tying politics of the pen to the League of Nations, which failed to prevent World War Two. The confidence I found on that stage was the first in a long series of awkward endeavors that culminating in my fearlessness today.I used to believe I was a vampire. Missing lateral incisors, beyond-pale skin, and extreme pollen allergy don\\'t paint the picture of a typical national parks hiking guide, but at some point all good explorers of the universe must reach beyond their own galaxies. Upon encountering a banana slug in Muir Woods, I decided it was my time. During week one as a volunteer guide, the faces of innocent bystanders attempting to follow my directions quickly revealed a gap in my abilities. Nuanced descriptions like \\'the loopy thing\\' or \\'the bendy red line\\' weren\\'t cutting it. I bonded with fellow-volunteer Roger, an 89-year-old former EMT and jewelry designer, and sheepishly asked him for tips on improving my map skills. Using his life stories, from backpacking in the Sahara to combat in Vietnam, Roger made cartography seem like an adventure. I eventually got the hang of speaking in maps and fell in love with this clear and elegant method of communication. A pair of heavily-washed socks, adorned with trees that resemble prehistoric amoeba, mark my journey from map illiteracy to enthusiastic navigator.At 15, I experienced death, marriage, and my first kiss while wearing truly hideous sweat absorbers in front of a few hundred people. I auditioned for my first play after a teacher doubted that I could temporarily trade my nerdier interests for acting. I gave it my all, avoiding any discussion of Yemen or endosymbiotic theory. As one of four leads in Much Ado About Nothing, I learned my lines and mastered dance patterns that slightly resembled Feynman diagrams of subatomic particles. Making my Michelin-Man-dress look stylish by comparison, my socks combined a horrible frill, the itchiest material ever conceived, in the form of a leg warmer-sock hybrid. Nevertheless, I treasure my time as a hitchhiker in the land of drama, and my souvenir socks. Maybe I\\'ll overcome my irrational fear of white dresses and return to my short-lived drama career. Regardless, I always want to push the limits of the universe that defines me. When I look inside my sock drawer, I see the results of exploring, of facing my most terrifying challenges; I see the beginning of who I want to be.\"}, {\"index\": 68, \"new_personal_statement\": \"A piercing silence marked my entry into the world. I was born in rural South India, where the birth of boys is celebrated with a loud, cheery bonfire and the birth of girls is marked by a reticent quietude. So, when I was born, my parents were subject to piteous apologies as I was to gendered scrutiny. Though I did not receive the grand welcome gifted to my male cousins, I, with some humor, compromised.Fourteen years later, I was living in sunny California when Andhra Pradesh, my home state in India, was divided; two political parties fought over which of their constituencies should receive infrastructure capital and ultimately decided that the only infrastructure they were going to build was a border. As sanitation, economic, and political conflicts hurt those in my village and around the state, I was told by my relatives that I should not dare to intervene as a girl. I felt the chilling silence that had marked my birth being forced on me again. This was an issue very much my own, of my village, and I intended to speak.Though I simply started by raising funds for the state, I could not shake the guilt of being an escapist during the bifurcation that could have been my reality. I spoke to friends and family and gained a meeting with a regional secretary in Andhra Pradesh.During our meeting, I presented my previous campaign work and research in the U.S, in hope that I would at least be awarded a temporary policy assignment. So when I received a call offering an opportunity to work as a policy researcher on a rural sanitation assignment, I felt a profound happiness at the opportunity to intimately reconcile with my culture through its politics. As I spent late nights summarizing sanitation policy in Nepal and Bangladesh, I felt my voice in the papers I wrote, the proposals I scripted.When I went to scout the Kadapa district in Andhra Pradesh as part of my research, my first step was quick, purposeful, and into a pile of human feces. The local children laughed. I laughed with them\\\\u2013 at least, I was no longer a stranger. I held 14-year-old Krithi\\'s hand as she led me to various sites: the site of open defecation, the river for bathing, and, finally, the period huts. Dejected at their sight, she explained that whenever girls in the area were menstruating, they had to spend their days in the hut and away from society and school.After months of summarizing policy and drafting a proposal, I was instructed by the regional director to speak to the village representative for approval to build a toilet in the district. He quickly interrupted me, \\'If I approve your toilet project, how will you get village girls to use them?\\' I was dumbfounded. I had not thought the usage would be an issue. The call ended inconclusively.After a week in isolated thought, I called back to tell him of the sanitary education plan I drafted, including providing locals with community monitoring, home visits, and seminars from cultural authorities. Either out of fear of losing credit on the project or genuine conviction, he approved toilets in the region.After a year, the data rolled in showing that toilet use and female school attendance in the region increased significantly. The state is still torn in two and achieving the slightest progress requires jumping through the hoops of bureaucracy. But, as I was giving a Skype seminar to my village\\'s girls about the importance of sanitation and school attendance, I realized the value of my own voice. To this day, I don\\'t know for whom the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh was the right battle. I do know, however, that there are thousands of right battles for public development which I seek to find and fight, my voice breaking the silence in its vicinity.Additional InformationCA Padigepati, Vishwa Shriya CEEB: 050103 Fall 20198 FYRD CAID: 21317669Since my freshman year, I have been enrolled in my school\\'s International Business Program( IBP). This rigorous program is designed to introduce students to various topics in the fields of marketing, entrepreneurship, accounting, and business ethics. Students are required to submit an application to be considered to the program. I also chose to pursue the International Baccalaureate Diploma, also offered at my school. These programs have provided me with the academic challenge I hope to gain at college.I had to forgo traveling for national debate tournaments at the end of my sophomore year of high school due to my family\\'s personal and financial circumstances. I have since used my skill and interest in public speaking and current events through advocacy work and policy research.The faces of Rwandan Genocide victims hung in the U.S Holocaust Museum as observers dedicated a mere second per photo. Looking at the pictures , I thought of how the Berlin Conference of 1860, which dissected Africa into colonial possessions, shaped this museum hall. History had never been a light-hearted subject, but, to me, it always supplied a clear lens with which to view the world. The Rohingya Genocide in Myanmar today bares many similarities to the historical Rwandan Genocide. As the advocacy director for STAND, a national organization dedicated to ending mass-atrocities, I hold an understanding of history as a foundation for my participation in the organization. \\'Senator, this bill is going to shape the public outlook towards humanitarian crises in the future so we don\\'t repeat the silence with which we met the Rwandan Genocide\\' I asserted. As I was lobbying with the STAND team in D.C. for the Ellie Wiesel Act, a bill which would endorse a Mass Atrocities Task Force and increase coordinated funding to deal with international crises, I kept in mind the importance of ensuring humanitarian aid for Rohinya refugees now. After researching the act and its implications for international policy, I realized how this type of legislation could have potentially prompted the United States to provide military aid and relief to help the victims of the Rwandan Genocide. Still, I was grateful that I had the opportunity to positively influence the outcome of the Rohingya Genocide through my role as advocacy director. I designed simple tasks for people- writing op-eds, calling on Congress, and signing petitions. As I work on policy campaigns with partners in the U.K, France, and Rwanda, I see the international cooperation I had wished for in the history books.In late June this year, I found out that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act. As an eternal student of history, I was thrilled that this could mean that the Rohingya Genocide might have a different outcome than the ones recorded in recent years.\"}, {\"index\": 69, \"new_personal_statement\": \"In October 2014, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi pledged to make India open defecation free (ODF) in five years through the \\'Clean India Mission\\'. At the time, only 38.7% of India had access to household latrines and more than 525 million people defecated in the open. While the move was widely appreciated by all stakeholders, it was the first government initiative to have a personal impact on me as some of my cousins did not have access to a toilet, whereas I did only because my grandfather ran from his home to join the Navy.Like many Indians, I joined the Prime Minister\\'s call to action. While working with a non-profit to increase the use of public toilets in an urban slum of Delhi in summer 2017, I received a call from a high-school friend who wanted me to join him for a week-long research trip to assess the impact of the Clean India Mission in Dindori, a minority-majority village in the state of Madhya Pradesh and one of India\\'s 250 most \\'backward\\' villages. I instantly agreed, and the two of us were all set to visit the village alone for a week.Dindori was an unexpected effluence of experience and self-realisation for me. My friend and I were assisted by two locals who knew my friend\\'s father and worked for the Clinton Foundation. We surveyed 167 households to check the condition of toilets, spent almost 13 hours a day in field, and lived in a hotel room which had \\'harmless\\' insects all over the bed. The ineffectiveness of the Clean India Mission was apparent. The government guaranteed a monetary incentive to villagers, which encouraged them to construct toilets\\\\u2014but not use them. Our data showed that 68% of residents still practiced open defecation and used latrines to store everything from fodder to hens! A village in the Bajag block called Bona had no sign of toilets whatsoever, but was still declared ODF. The locals told us that it takes only one single forged document to be declared ODF, and the verification process never transpires. Indeed, the government verified only 27 out of the 365 ODF-declared villages in Madhya Pradesh, but still the Prime Minister used the state as an example of the campaign\\'s exemplary work. The reality: the government\\'s commitment to make India ODF by 2019 was based on forged declarations without verification.I was furious that government officials had been blatantly lying for political gains. As my friend became busy with his Grade 12 examinations and ceased his involvement, it fell on me to finish compiling the data. I decided to file a Right to Information demand (a FOIA-like request) to compare government data with our research, but I was dissuaded from doing so by an acquaintance who received death threats after filing one to check on a dysfunctional government hospital. A mentor of mine who helped me with a digital literacy project suggested that I expose the government by writing an article. I was worried about the idea, as physical and psychological harassment against journalists increased significantly after the BJP (the Prime Minister\\'s political party) came to power. He put me in contact with a journalist who encouraged me to write the article and agreed to publish it with me as a ghostwriter.While I was writing the article, I reflected on my transformation from a naive supporter to a pragmatic critic. I thought of the people I met in Dindori, who shared their national identity with me, yet did not have access to basic facilities. I realised that the government was lying callously and my anonymity would just validate the fear instilled in people willing to speak against the government. Ultimately, I decided to include my name. The final draft was distributed to the 712,604 readers of the Youth Ki Awaaz online magazine, who featured the article I wrote for myself, Dindori and an ODF India.\"}, {\"index\": 70, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Is that you?\\' My eyes widened as Baba paused on a page in her photo album.\\'Yes, believe it or not,\\' she said with a smile. My grandmother left the room, giving me more time with the photograph. She was dressed in a resplendent kimono embroidered with yellow chrysanthemums and cascading wisterias. Her face was delicately powdered like a winter\\'s first snow. A golden fan was nestled in her hand. My grandmother came back with the fan and kimono from the photograph draped on her arm. \\'Do you want to try it on?\\' she asked me. She held the kimono open. I carefully slipped my arms inside its heavy sleeves. The kimono draped around me like a warm blanket. Baba whipped the fan open. \\'This is a sensu,\\' she explained. Baba rotated the fan with her fingers. \\'You can use it to convey a scroll, an umbrella, or even falling cherry blossom petals.\\'With each delicate pivot of her wrist, the fan spun and fluttered like a feather. I was awestruck, not just of the elegance and beauty of her artistry, but of the power she held. She was a storyteller, someone who could inspire others. Learning nihonbuyo, or traditional Japanese dance, was not easy. I was disappointed when my first lesson did not involve any dancing. Rather, I spent the first month of my training learning how to bow. At the conclusion of each performance, a performer bows to the audience so to express his or her mutual respect and gratitude. Learning how to bow instilled in me the importance of reigi, or consideration of others. I became aware of how performing nihonbuyo before an audience was a privilege. As I advanced in my studies, I felt empowered by how my performances stirred the imaginations of my audiences. Like my Baba before me, I became a storyteller who could evoke a diversity of emotions within others.When my family moved to the United States, I was afraid that I would lose my ability to connect with others through my art. My transition to a new country and a new culture was difficult to say the least. I could not communicate with my teachers. Classmates made fun of me and my onigiri lunches. I began to question whether my Japanese heritage was inhibiting me from making meaningful relationships in my new home.A few months after my arrival, I learned of \\'International Night,\\' an event that allowed students of different cultures an opportunity to present their heritage to the entire school. I began to recall memories of my nihonbuyo studies in Japan: the thrill of performing for others, the confidence I felt from sharing my creativity, the empathy I felt and shared with my audience. Nihonbuyo would help me make new connections with my classmates. I signed up to perform.I remember watching from behind the stage curtains, clenching my sleeves, waiting for the announcer to introduce my name. When I heard the soft shamisen melody, I glided to the center of the stage. Like I had done so many times before, I snapped open my fan and swayed in rhythm to the music. And like so many times before, I began crafting new bonds and relationships with my audience through the shared experience of nihonbuyo.As I look forward to a new chapter in my development as both an artist and a scholar, I am aware that I will continue to experience situations where my heritage and identity may contribute to apprehensive conversations and difficult interactions with others. However, I will rely upon the lesson that I have learned from nihonbuyo: storytelling has tremendous power as a means of communication and as a way to create empathy between individuals of different backgrounds and diverse perspectives. \"}, {\"index\": 71, \"new_personal_statement\": \"At the tender age of six I didn\\'t understand why my grandma wasn\\'t like other grandmas. I was mortified when my friends mocked the way she talked and acted, and I hated the fact that the painful truth of my ethnicity could not be concealed. Why couldn\\'t she speak English? Why did she ferment smelly soybeans instead of baking cookies? In a desperate effort to hide all traces of my heritage, I began to teach my grandma the alphabet.\\'A is for annyeong\\\\u2014hello. B is for bada\\\\u2014ocean,\\' I said as I scribbled the letters down. My grandma repeated after me enthusiastically, gingerly mimicking the strokes on her crinkled legal pad. \\'C is for\\\\u2026\\' I trailed off. I was stuck. I repeatedly sounded out the the harsh click of the letter but could not think of a connecting Korean word.\\'Kotnorae!\\' Grandma exclaimed. My eyes widened and my ears perked up. What was this strange word I had never heard before? I tested its texture on my tongue, swished it around in my mouth. The nasally stop in the middle sounded like that of humming, and it was exactly that: ko for nose, norae for song. Kotnorae\\\\u2014humming. It was such a simple combination of words that produced a completely new meaning, so straightforward that it led me to believe I could create my own. I started forming useful amalgamations to eliminate society\\'s struggle to find the right words. What would the world do without me?Teok for chin, teol for fur\\\\u2014teokteol. I used this brilliant new term to describe the few fine curls that adorned my aunt\\'s jaw; she was not as excited as I was. I later found out that most of the words I tried to invent already existed, which fueled me to learn every word in the Korean language in order to figure out which ones the world needed me to make. As I flipped through my Korean-English dictionary, I grew fascinated with the art of language: endless possibilities of meanings, millions of connotations to generate feelings and mental images. The fact that vibrations of air waves could hold such significance, that I could communicate with someone across the world just by imitating a sound, that I could connect seemingly dissimilar parts into a logical, coherent whole boggled my mind. I became proud of my bilingualism. When Grandma offered to teach me more Korean words and expressions during our daily alphabet classes, the lessons that I had started out of shame transformed into linguistic and cultural enlightenments that gifted me with curiosity and pride.I began to hold my head up high, wanting to prove to everyone that different is not synonymous with inferior; I taught the Korean alphabet and funky vocabulary to kids under the slides at recess and shared my lunch with troopers who were willing to try kimchi. Every day after school, I told Grandma about what I had accomplished and begged her to teach me more about Korea. Together, we fermented the soybeans I had hated so much, and I came to love eating them. It\\'s an acquired taste. My cultural pride and satisfaction from teaching others began to show in other aspects of my life. Never wanting anyone to feel ostracized, I approached everyone, from helping peers in class to sitting with the new student from Puerto Rico at lunch. I became a volunteer Korean language teacher to show Korean-American children early that our heritage is something to be flaunted, not buried with rejection of language and Kraft Lunchables (I also taught them to never point out their aunt\\'s facial hair). I advocated for North Korean refugees, helping them integrate themselves into the culture of education, building bridges with the knowledge that Grandma passed down to me.Grandma left behind much more than a love for new words and stinky foods. She left behind my first steps toward building an interconnected world of understanding, and I know that my passion for language and culture comes from that frail soul who taught me to be proud. Why couldn\\'t other grandmas speak Korean? Why did they bake cookies instead of fermenting smelly soybeans?I had probably cried in his arms over a thousand times. My brother\\'s soft whispers of comfort and soothing smell of pine could not fill the hole in my heart. The air was thick with tension and fear, and it was evident that neither of us could do much more than offer solace in silence, afraid to speak our thoughts into existence. My mother burst into the kitchen and splashed a glass of water onto my face.\\'Die,\\' she growled. She turned to my brother. \\'Kill her. Where are the knives?\\'It was just another Sunday morning in the fall of my junior year when my father told us that Mom was having a relapse of psychosis. I was puzzled. My mom? Mom, who still treats me like a baby and smothers me with kisses? Mom, who has never shown me a frown? I refused to believe him. But when I saw how my stoic father stood alone in the dark living room, small shoulders rocking and rigid face unfamiliarly wet, I had no choice but to believe. He reassured us that Mom would get better within a few days, that a 20-year-old tangerine prescription bottle would rid us of our woes. Yet days turned into weeks, and Mom did not come back to us. Her emotions became oscillatory, her speech incoherent, her behavior erratic. Her foreign, blank gaze chilled me to the bone\\\\u2014it terrified me to see her so sick. I began to sleep in my brother\\'s room, barricading the door with his reassuringly weighty sofa, paranoid that Mom would come into the room in the dead of night. I studied in the bathrooms, the only rooms with a lock in our house. On her aggressive days, I hid the knives, my hands and heart trembling.Mom\\'s illness had rendered us, and our house, a wreck\\\\u2014she had always shouldered the burden of housework. My father and brother didn\\'t know how to cook anything remotely edible, but I had no right to complain. What did I know? I\\'d never washed a dish in my life. As we filled our stomachs with instant ramen and cold rice, dirty clothes piling up to our damp cheeks, I saw how spoiled I had been, how lonely Mom must have felt. I got angry at her when my clothes weren\\'t dry. I scrolled through nonsensical media, wasting time I could have spent eating her favorite red bean buns with her. I irritably turned away from her kisses, claiming to be the big girl I wasn\\'t.I tried to take over Mom\\'s role\\\\u2014I cooked crunchy eggs, used a stool to dust the shelves that Mom would have reached with ease, and did laundry with the help of Google. Fearing the evanescence of family, I played Baduk with my father and brother in the evenings, bonding over the quiet musings of our day. Instead of concerning myself with the societal cacophony of notifications and calls, I read poetry to Mom, resting my head on her lap, blanketed by the subdued yellow glow of her favorite antique lamp. And when Mom came to, her first words were not concern for herself:\\'Are you okay?\\'Words contain the heart. That is why even the simplest remark can give off warmth.The fleeting days we take for granted could be stolen at any moment, just like me on that Sunday morning\\\\u2014only I was given the gift of reflection and time. I had never been on the other side of the door; up until now, I had focused on my own contentment. But after swinging that door open and walking through to see through the eyes of Mom, I have found what is truly important. It is not leisure, posting pictures, or success. It is the relief of coming home to familiar open arms, the unconditional acceptance of our faults, the warmth of a simple remark from a loved one.\"}, {\"index\": 72, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I cried while taking my first steps.The cold sand of Point Pleasant beach meddled between my toes, intrusive and unwelcome. I demanded to be held, but my parents stood back, choosing to let me experience this moment alone.Though a graceless taste of independence, my first steps were that and so much more. I felt the Earth on my own for the first time; my love for discovery, unknown to me then, would be unraveled in time.My unwavering curiosity took me places. I set ambitions from writing a novel to committing facts from the United States Atlas to heart. In channeling my creativity and exploring the world, everything made sense.Everything excited me, for I was not given knowledge \\\\u2013 I was discovering it. I seized responsibility to answer my own questions, as my answers were pieces bringing me closer to a whole. As the guardian of my own inquiry, I was steadfast in a direction.Growing older, my sense of direction blurred. My world, rooted in facts and information, collided with the abstract of pursuing dreams. With unyielding faith in her dream, my mother introduced into my life DomaDoma, the Korean restaurant she envisioned owning. To me, this change seemed discordant \\\\u2013 strings playing all at once in a wrong key. Raised to believe in a practical approach to life, I was unable to see tangible potential in risk. As my mother grappled with choosing between a job of greater stability and becoming a chef, I fell under the illusion that my family had grown weaker due to the lack of certainty our lives now held. The image of my parents as Korean immigrants building a future grounded in pragmatism felt contradicted.Where my parents saw a dream, I saw a distraction. In spite of the stars in my parents\\' eyes, I saw dusty floors feigning a galaxy. DomaDoma lasted five years \\\\u2013 its later days defined by empty chairs and tables. I witnessed my parents lose their fire, distance wedging between them, as I began to resent their loyalty to a dream that would eventually fail. Upon the restaurant\\'s closing, my mother\\'s passion for creativity waned, as she no longer channeled it in her cooking. I pondered the impact: were we now a family broken by a dissolved dream, or would we remain a family hopeful of a better future? The questions I asked were no longer ones for which I could find answers; they grew uncontrollably into ones I feared asking myself.I turned to academics as an escape. I immersed myself in subjects from chemistry to music theory, eliciting solace in clear answers. I found harmony in the periodic table, beauty in thermodynamics, and comfort in counting beats of both simple and compound meter. Despite believing I was restoring my ground, I fell from short-lived grace. Avoiding the questions I feared most, I was merely circling around my problems, letting the chaos of my unexplored questions heighten. Ultimately, I reached a catharsis: what I needed was not a rigid sense of order, but rather a willingness to embrace change.In the chaos, I would find clarity. I needed to look at my life not through a single failure for which I had no control, but through the very pieces comprising the whole that is my family. The failure of my family\\'s business was not a testament to weakness; it was a lesson in resilience. I now know that we reign as a family of rich experiences that fix in us infinite vitality and golden souls. Beauty encompasses all; it is merely a matter of searching.I will forever be planted in the unfamiliar sands that challenged my first steps. Nevertheless, the prospect of starting over \\\\u2014 standing up from a fall \\\\u2014 no longer impedes my direction. In these sands, I will not wilt \\\\u2014 I will bloom.\"}, {\"index\": 73, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I would toy with steel catheters as if they were model trains and scribble on scrubs instead of paper. Mygrandparents have videos of 7-year-old me giddily shouting \\'aneurysm\\', thinking it was a curse word.For a year before being whisked off to Abu Dhabi, I had been left with my grandmother, a wizened gynaecologistat the biggest hospital in Delhi. A stark contrast to the silent bustle of American hospitals, those in India wereabsolutely hectic: the population of Kentucky would squeeze in and out of the waiting rooms each afternoon.But even the busiest ICUs paled in comparison to the hospital canteen at 8 pm: no, that was a unique breed ofanarchy tolerable to only the steeliest of the Indian capital. A celebration of chaos, where 500 weary staff wouldconvene, like clockwork, in a \\'cosy\\' cafeteria soon bursting with sweat-induced humidity and the overpoweringstench of fermenting antiseptic. And it was one I had to navigate every night.Calling it a queue for food would be misleading; it would be more aptly described as a mob, a horde, a tsunami ofsurgeons and pharmacists, secretaries and nurses, each contributing five fingers to the wall of hands stretching toseize silver platters frantically churned out by worried canteen cooks. This was a doctor-eat-doctor jungle: a denseecosystem of stethoscopes and spinach, where natural selection rewarded the boldest with a filling dinner, and thepolite with nothing but crumbs of a meal that might once have been.To a timid child accustomed to the comfort of please and thank you, to the warm monotony of civility, this eatingarrangement did not bode well. Standing in a \\'queue\\' that somehow grew longer while I stayed at the back left myappetite as frayed as my sanity; every weeknight quickly became a hungry ordeal.The hospital canteen was a new world, one that moved fast, where momentum was your friend and, if you didn\\'tkeep moving and grab what you need, you\\'d never get it. This new world revealed a soft audacity that I didn\\'tknow I had: a gentle conviction to spot an opening, and act on it without hesitation. A refusal to be sidelined as anadorable but, ultimately, inconsequential instrument looking for its place amidst an orchestra of jostling adults.After a while, every day became a routine of\\\\u2014breathing in\\\\u2014and throwing myself, face first, into the richmessiness of humanity that was somehow so ubiquitous.In the years that ensued, this soft audacity kept CareerFear, my charity, from being trampled underfoot. Like thewobbling first domino in a mile-long line, that year spent exploring the hospital set subsequent days inmotion\\\\u2014days when I would move with more confidence through the busy world of adults, of charity executivesand business leaders, days of sending moonshot emails, of cold calling until my lips were chapped, of trying tocreate something from nothing, days of being told \\'no\\' over and over and over again but smiling because oneopening was all I needed. These days bled into weeks that bled into four years of asking, reaching out,lobbying\\\\u2014this time not for myself, but for those born without a voice to ask at all.Whether it\\'s at a charity fundraiser or hospital canteen, I\\'ve found that opportunity often hides in plain sight,masked sometimes by shyness, sometimes complacency, and sometimes by a sea of hungry doctors. Takinginitiative feels like playing at a dangerous game; a silent tip-toeing, a sacred duel around convention, where it\\'sonly after you stand up and take action that you realise that the only thing ever stopping you was yourself.UCAS Personal Statement--Application for Natural SciencesAs we asymptotically refine our understanding of exactly how a biological process occurs (say, enzymes in DNA replication), we are increasingly empowered to artificially exert control over the process (through PCR, in this case). And this is what excites me most about biology: advances can transform complex systems into tamed technology, helping us incrementally leverage mastery over life itself.At the UK team selection camp for the 2018 International Biology Olympiad (IBO) at the University of Warwick, I got my first taste of exactly how vast biology really is. Whether it was through drawing floral formulae to determine evolutionary relationships between plants, or investigating the effect of a suspected cofactor on enzymes of the lac operon in E.coli, the practical exams at the BBO finals revealed to me that ingenuity in experimental design is often as crucial as careful execution.In From X-rays to DNA: How Engineering Drives Biology by W. David Lee, I saw that Max Perutz\\'s contributions to proteomics were built upon years of laborious research into computational methods. I learned that in research, more time is spent exploring dead ends, creating new technologies to test hypotheses and in collaborating within teams than is spent having \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018eureka\\' moments or postulating theories. In turn, I\\'m more appreciative of inventive experiments, where the methodology is now as interesting as the results themselves.I also enjoy communicating why the study of life sciences is important at all. In my highly commended submission to the Corpus Christi Biology Essay Prize, I examined how marine phages are responsible for biogeochemical cycling and therefore planetary homeostasis. Equally, presenting research about the effects of semiconductor manufacture on keystone species in the San Francisco Bay to colleagues was rewarding, helping re-enforce how hypotheses proved false may be just as relevant and meaningful as those supported by evidence. While research in pure biology is fascinating, I believe revolutions often take place at the intersection of fields. At a lecture on vesicular trafficking by Professor James Rothman, I learned that one of his Nobel-prize winning insights was to use a viral protein (VSV-G) that is given a sugar modification upon arrival at the Golgi to track vesicular fusion. In conversation, he recalled coming up with this idea while reflecting on the work he did during his BA in Physics. This furthered my appreciation for how the study of natural sciences in parallel enables \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018light-bulb\\' moments in learning one science translate into a more nuanced understanding of another. As a consequence, I took on a project on hemodynamics, through which I explored how computational fluid mechanics can be used to better model multi-arterial systems. Similarly, a project on co-ordination chemistry had me explore the medicinal importance of stereoisomerism by studying Cisplatin, a complex ion commonly used in chemotherapy. It quickly became clear to me that, at the frontiers of science, some of the most exciting breakthroughs come when researchers immersed in their own discipline learn the language and thought processes of other natural sciences.Outside of scientific pursuits, I serve as the Founder & Executive Director at CareerFear, an international nonprofit that connects students at underprivileged schools around the world to careers opportunities and work experience. Within school, I co-chair the Science Society, and also act as a school prefect. Equipped with a degree in the Natural Sciences, I seek to explore the biotechnology industry as an entrepreneur, and to use insight gleaned through varying scientific lenses to contribute to advances in biotech, healthcare, and beyond.\"}, {\"index\": 74, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I\\'m in a dark hallway, walking towards someone. He\\'s walking toward me. As we approach, he looks up, arching his neck. I recognize his curious eyes, his poofy hair, his bushy eyebrows; I know this face, but I\\'m too embarrassed. I look away as we pass.He\\'s crushed. His face loses its innocent curiosity.Nevertheless, he keeps walking; he has a show to put on. He has practiced his entire middle school career\\\\u2014all of six months. The auditorium is filled with every kid in his school. This is a big deal.He is doing his best to live in the moment, but his mind wanders to the hallway, \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Why didn\\'t he say hi to me?\\' \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Is it something I did?\\' \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018What is his problem with me?\\' As he contemplates, he fails to notice the teetering drum set, his brain trapped in a circle of self-doubt. Crack. The drums release their loose screws, and he hits the rim as they collapse, sending the stick flying from his hand. He looks at me, but I turn away, refusing to associate with his failures. He scurries to the stick. All the while, he tears himself apart, \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Why didn\\'t I check the screws?\\' \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018He\\'s going to remember this forever\\\\u2026\\' Growing up, I wasn\\'t very friendly with my past. I devalued my accomplishments, allowing a skewed interpretation of my story to become my truth. David Sedaris writes in \\'Day in, Day out\\' that reading diary entries from your past can be depressing, and you can easily start to shun these past selves, creating an ugly cycle of self-deprecation. I had fallen victim to this thought pattern.Fortunately, over the last couple of years, I\\'ve grown to look at my past from a different perspective, appreciating my past selves and the hard work they put in to get me where I am today. They were always just doing their best, and every single one is an integral part of who I am. Naturally, as I\\'ve started to appreciate myself more, I better appreciate those around me.Maybe you\\'ve heard of a nodding friend, an old friend you\\'ve grown distant from, but one you acknowledge with a nod and a smile whenever you pass them on the street or in the hall. The significance of an accepting nod can be exponential.I\\'m in the same hallway, except it\\'s much lighter this time. Just like before, I\\'m walking towards someone.I recognize the same curious eyes, poofy hair, bushy eyebrows; this time I know what to do. As we pass, I give him a nod. He nods right back, and he does his best to conceal a grin.He keeps walking, except now he\\'s running; it\\'s showtime.He\\'s living in the moment, and his mind is free. As he celebrates, he fails to notice the leaning drum set, his brain giddy with excitement. Crack. The drums crumble. The stick sets sail. He looks at me, and I give him a nod and a smile. He\\'s got this. He nods back, and without a second thought, he leaps from his stool and captures the rogue stick. In the same second, he hops back on his stool, and he begins to play. He smiles as the crowd begins to cheer. \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Yes!! That was nuts!\\' The crowd leaves. I walk down to the stage. As I get closer, I look at him and recognize my curious eyes, my poofy hair, my bushy eyebrows. His hair\\'s shorter, but he\\'ll soon realize he likes it better long, like mine.

My parents have provided little information about him: he is tall, has brown hair, and has a brother. Truly, my only confidant in matters regarding this mystery man is my sister, Jordan, and that\\'s simply because her DNA is almost identical to mine.I epitomize a rarity. Only about a half of a percent of all pregnancies produce identical twins, and a mere fraction of those are conceived through means of a sperm donor. Yet, until high school, my anomalous nature seemed to end there.As the child of a sperm donor, my head was\\\\u2014and still is\\\\u2014constantly filled with millions of unanswered questions. What does my father look like? Where is he from? Is he married, and does he have children of his own? In what ways are the two of us similar?It was hard to feel unique when I didn\\'t possess the basic knowledge about myself that would set me apart from my classmates. When my friends discussed their familial backgrounds\\\\u2014how their great-great-grandparents had moved from Russia to Chicago or how their mother\\'s side of the family is from Germany and their father\\'s side of the family is from Japan\\\\u2014I was left stumbling for words. \\'I\\'m pretty sure my family is just European,\\' I\\'d usually respond.And having a sister who looks exactly like me and shares many of my personality traits often made matters of identity worse. Where I did feel unique, there was someone living in my house and going to the same school with the very same quality that had made me feel special in the first place.For essentially all of elementary and middle school, I resented the fact that I wasn\\'t \\'special\\'\\\\u2014in my eyes at least. I was angry that I didn\\'t know my dad\\'s name and my friends knew theirs, and that I could never say where my family was from, and that I would never definitively know how many siblings I had. I was angry that Jordan and I were both good at soccer, and that we had the same best friends, and that we liked the same style of music.But, by the time I entered high school, I was tired of being angry. I didn\\'t want to go through the rest of my life feeling ordinary, so I took it upon myself to be extraordinary, and through my pursuit of individualism, I grew to be a nonconformist of sorts.For much of middle school, I was afraid to voice opinions or do anything that wasn\\'t readily accepted by the majority of my classmates, as I feared that I\\'d be ostracized. Today, I vocalize my libertarian political views in my extremely liberal school. I admit that I\\'m a musical theater junkie, even though my friends poke fun at people who hum show tunes in the hallways. I gush over cross country and track, in spite of my classmates who think that runners aren\\'t \\'real athletes.\\' I excitedly talk about multivariable calculus, even though people consider me a \\'math nerd\\' for doing so. And, I proudly wear my most comfortable shoes, Crocs, to school, despite the fact that no one considers them to be particularly fashionable.While being the child of a sperm donor and an identical twin once led me to question my individuality, that very lack of identity is now the driving force contributing to my willingness to be my own person, regardless of what others think. I don\\'t know who my father is or where my family\\'s from. I sometimes still don\\'t know what sets me apart from my identical twin. But, I do know that I\\'m a proud runner, math nerd, and musical theater fanatic, and\\\\u2014for me\\\\u2014that\\'s enough.For much of elementary school, my summers were filled with water guns, capture the flag, and Otter Pops. While my peers looked forward to another day of playing video games, I jumped out of bed, excited to head to camp. There, I could run around for hours or sit in the shade and make a friendship bracelet. And, as a seventeen-year-old, my summers aren\\'t very different; it\\'s with the same enthusiasm that I head to my summer job, where I work at that very camp as a counselor. What began as an attempt to prolong my experiences as a camper soon grew to be less about winning the most games of dodgeball, and more about being the best counselor possible. As I adjusted to my new position, I began to see it as my duty to make the kids in my community view camp the same way I used to; I wanted them to look forward to camp every day \\\\u2014 not see it as a daycare. Trying to achieve this goal isn\\'t always easy. It means giving up kickball to play handball for three hours because that\\'s two campers\\' favorite activity \\\\u2014 even though it\\'s your least favorite. It means consoling a camper about his scratched knee because that\\'s a big deal to him \\\\u2014 even if it\\'s not to you. It means collaborating with other counselors to ensure that the kids have the best experience possible \\\\u2014 even if those people aren\\'t always easy to work with. At the end of my last week this summer, a camper approached me with sadness in his eyes. When asked what was wrong, he responded, \\'I\\'m just sad you\\'re leaving because camp is really fun when you\\'re here.\\' It\\'s experiences like these that remind me why I come back every year, despite occasionally having to deal with difficult situations, difficult campers, and difficult co-workers. Being a camp counselor isn\\'t just about setting up activities and watching over kids \\\\u2014 it\\'s about making sacrifices for the sake of others, and seeing those sacrifices pay off is why I find it so rewarding.\"}, {\"index\": 76, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I was in the second grade when I told myself I was smart, and that I was destined for greatness. I was proud of myself: I never had to work hard for grades others struggled for; everything came naturally and teachers called me gifted. However, I\\'d never be as smart as Nathan\\\\u2014my close friend, piano prodigy, and class valedictorian.Despite our closeness, we began to drift apart, and all I heard about Nathan were his high grades and stellar extracurriculars. When we got into the same high school he became a distant memory: no longer a person in my mind, but an ideal: the epitome of the perfect student. Eventually, I grew too busy with my own classes to worry about him. I soon realized that at our high school, everybody had the same story: talented prodigies since birth, destined for outstanding colleges and careers. Expectations were higher, more demanding, and I began to struggle in classes. I felt cheated by all the teachers who said I was a smart kid who would go far, and I watched others surpass me with minimal effort. By the end of freshman year, with the feeling of incompetence constantly looming over me, I decided I should get used to not being at the top. But junior year came with constant reminders of college, bringing me back to the beginning of freshman year: constantly worried about underperforming, always comparing myself to others. I became a machine, shutting myself off from friends, staying up late to work. I tried convincing myself that I all that mattered was grades, but the truth was, I was always exhausted and sleep-deprived. My grades were doing better than ever, but mentally, I was at my worst. At least until one day, in the March of my junior year.I was on my way to school when someone caught my eye and halted my worried thoughts. I recognized his slouched posture before I even saw his face. Nathan. I caught up to him and made small talk: \\'What\\'s up? Haven\\'t seen you in forever.\\' \\'Yeah, I transferred out of Stuy. I go to our local school now.\\' Before I could think of a response, he disappeared into the crowd of commuters. Even if he had stayed I probably wouldn\\'t have known what to respond, because suddenly I recalled a family dinner months ago, barely listening to my mom talking about Nathan as I was sure it was about his grades. Except this time it wasn\\'t. This time she was saying that he wasn\\'t sleeping, that he was vomiting from the stress, that he was going to transfer out\\\\u2026 I wanted to ask how he was doing, but by now he seemed as many worlds away as he did all those years ago, back when he was the smartest kid I knew. As I watched his lanky frame grow smaller and smaller as he walked away, I saw myself in him. I pictured him before he transferred, waking up nauseous with anxiety, falling asleep on the commute, dragging himself through classes as if life had no other purpose\\\\u2014just like I\\'d been for the past year. Nathan was right: mental health is more important than any good grade. I realized then the same thing he figured out when he decided to transfer. I decided that something needed to change, that I had to change. So over the next few months, I started getting food with friends after school, going to football games instead of cramming. Of course, grades still matter, and the nagging insecurity never totally disappears, but I don\\'t let it affect my mental health anymore. If I could go back, these are the things I\\'d tell Nathan\\\\u2014long before either of us knew what stress even meant, when we were too busy looking ahead to our futures to care who might be above us. \"}, {\"index\": 77, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I never imagined that a game of handball could become a proxy battle for who was right about the China-Taiwan conflict, but here I was, my first time in Nepal, and the game was nothing short of savage. Getting into a conflict with my students probably was not the greatest way to introduce myself, but I refused to budge. After spending the first nine years of my life in Taiwan, I stood firm in my belief that Taiwan is an independent nation. However, my Nepalese students stated defiantly that Taiwan is a part of China. The game would settle who was right, once and for all.We played fiercely, and something wonderful happened. With every bounce of the ball, the bond between us grew stronger. As we played, the walls between us started to come down. Every drop of sweat, every heckle and jeer, every move we made all served to bring us closer together. We replaced our hostility with camaraderie as we bonded over our mutual love of Taylor Swift and spaghetti. Half an hour later, the tension was completely forgotten and I had friends instead of adversaries.I thought about that game a great deal that summer. Conflict resolution was my passion, and I had the experience from Model UN and living through high school to know not everything can be solved by slapping a ball around. At first, I was reluctant to go to Nepal, yet I realized that I had to embrace whatever opportunities life sent my way. I was reminded of how fulfilling simple pleasures are: whether it was pulling off leeches, learning new card games while stuck in the mountains, or overcoming my fear of chickens while walking to the local school, it was only through being bold, unafraid, and confident that I would change and grow as a person. I returned to Nepal for the second time to help out underprivileged students, and this time I had come prepared with non-toxic pencils. The kids loved sucking on their pencils while thinking, and that seemed like a great way for them to give themselves lead poisoning.Though, lead poisoning might explain why the kids mixed up Taiwan and Thailand. Of course, it was an understandable mistake to make. I took great pride in explaining to them the difference and my take on the China/Taiwan question. For them, China was a friendly gateway to trade and tourism. For me, China was a potential menace that made the strait between China and Taiwan one of the most dangerous places on Earth. They fixed on me with rapt attention when I explained my perspective. Afterwards, they told me the solution was simple: China was bigger and the bigger country should win. They were serious. What can I say? Their debate skills needed honing. That is why I was there after all.We spent a lot of time returning to the idea of right, wrong, and compromise. They often took China\\'s side on the issue. I rarely had the opportunity to talk about the China-Taiwan conflict honestly, as my peers were aware of the complexity of the issue and afraid to offend each other. The innocence of the children allowed them to speak boldly, allowing me to hear unfiltered perspectives on the conflict for the first time. This impacted me, and debating with them helped me clarify what I believe in and allowed me to see where those with contrasting beliefs are coming from. Today, my perspective of the China-Taiwan conflict has not changed, but I understand that agreement is not always the best possible outcome. People have real differences of opinion. These different opinions are what distinguish us from each other, and should not be abandoned for conformity. As I embark on the next stage of my life, I aspire to approach different perspectives without judgement and continue developing my ability to understand the world around me.Growing up, I was labeled as a \\'humanities person\\' and never considered myself strong in STEM subjects. The \\'C\\' on my math midterm in fourth grade definitely did not encourage me to pursue this area of study. This changed when my freshmen physics class was called to a demonstration meeting by the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition team. My first reaction to hearing that we had an \\'engineering\\' presentation was boredom. However, after attending the demonstration, I was surprised: for the first time, I found myself genuinely interested in science. The ability of genetic engineering to \\'play God\\' and the power to improve lives attracted me.Afterwards, I approached the presenting seniors and asked whether I could join iGEM in the future despite being a \\'humanities person\\'. The seniors told me that science includes people from different backgrounds, and urged to me stop labeling myself and explore whatever interests me. Their words were inspiring. I realized I was limiting myself by thinking that the humanities were my only strength. There was definitely something to be gained by challenging myself to do things outside my wheelhouse. From liking math for the first time during the probability unit to immersing myself in the brain\\'s neural network, everything around me filled me with curiosity. Fulfilling my freshman dream, I became a member of the iGEM team in my junior year and found my niche as the Policy Head. I composed a policy brief covering nanoparticles in existing chemical regulations and created policy proposals for strengthening the safety and regulation of nanoparticle usage. Afterwards, I attended the iGEM Giant Jamboree in Boston, where our team won the Grand Prize. Through interacting with other teams, I learned that the intersection between science and policy is crucial and emphasized by the scientific community. This role combines my strengths in the humanities with my interests in science, and echoes what the seniors told me four years ago: science has a place for everyone. More importantly, challenging myself to grow and learn will take me to places I could not have imagined.I never imagined that a game of handball could become a proxy battle for the China-Taiwan conflict, but here I was, first visit to Nepal, and the game was nothing short of savage.

He smiled and introduced himself as Murtaza,. I then introduced myself to the other boys, Samir and Tariq.In April 2015, my school had the honor of sponsoring three Afghan boys to attend our school\\'s annual Model United Nations conference. I met them for the first time at a welcome dinner, and we started to talk about topics ranging from the political situation in Afghanistan to the environment in Taiwan to our future educational plans. As we learned about each other, our conversations became more informal, and we found ourselves half an hour later discussing our favorite movie of the year: Fast and Furious 7. Hearing the name of the movie, other students joined the conversation. The scene of a diverse group of students bonding over mutual interests impacted me deeply.During the conference, I led a group of students to fundraise over $5,000 USD to support a new initiative to bring MUN to Afghanistan. Inspired by the support, the three Afghan boys subsequently founded the first MUN and leadership NGO in Afghanistan: Hope, Education, and Leadership in Afghanistan (HELA). Yet I realized that fundraising is inadequate. Service, a necessary and crucial part of MUN, has been forgotten amidst the competitive culture of the activity.This realization inspired me to lead a mentorship program between students from my school and students at HELA. The weekly Skype session is a priceless learning experience for both parties as we practice cross-cultural dialogue, learn empathy, and realize the importance of service. This initiative created a trend of emphasizing service at MUN conferences that has spread to major conferences all over Taiwan. Two years into the program, HELA has expanded dramatically. As it became more self-sufficient, I used my experience and envisioned a global MUN peer mentoring program that runs on a similar model. After overcoming various obstacles and failures, I have finally brought the program into fruition under the name \\'OMUN Workshops\\' in collaboration with the Online Model United Nations Organization.When he fell off a cliff, Harold drew a hot air balloon to catch himself. When he fell in love with an apple tree, he created a dragon to guard its jewels. When he created too many pies for himself, he drew hungry animals to prevent waste. After becoming entrenched in the world of current affairs and politics through my endeavors in and out of school, I dreamed of having the power to change the world with as much ease as a children\\'s book character. However, without Harold\\'s magical crayon, I am left with only my wits and passion as I journey to understand the way our world works and the challenges we face.From the structure of regimes in Aristotle\\'s Politics to the theological or utilitarian justification arguments in Mozi, I have long been fascinated with philosophy and politics.  Residing in Taiwan, a precarious island situated within one of the largest geopolitical conflicts on earth, I have drawn my interests from the constant upheaval of the Taiwanese government and its volatile relationship with China. As a result, I have devoted my time to Model United Nations and the speech and debate team as a way of cultivating my passion for persuasion and politics.Besides politics and philosophy, I am also drawn to social welfare and sustainability. As international relations and global issues become ever more complex, I want to examine issues such as income inequality, the rise of extremism, development and conservation, and gender and race issues. Like Harold, I want to draw my own path as I continue to work on becoming the socially and politically responsible citizen I aspire to be. In a time filled with political uncertainty and apathy, I am appreciative of Harold instilling confidence in me and making me believe that I, too, have the power to take on the world. I know that government policies and cultural traditions are difficult to change, but I firmly believe that by equipping myself with knowledge I can find inspiration in surprising places and put theory into practice to make a change on issues that matter.\"}, {\"index\": 78, \"new_personal_statement\": \"When I pushed open the door to the kitchen, Cosmin looked up from the pan he was scrubbing. \\'Mr. America is here!\\' he shouted over to me with only a hint of sarcasm. And so would begin my shift at Victoria\\'s, the small-town eatery where I\\'d been washing dishes for the past two summers. As an off-the-books summer expat, ready to get elbow deep in the soup pot, this felt like the lowliest work in Scotland. In Victoria\\'s windowless kitchen, the chefs would dart back and forth from the counter to the stove, balancing their attention between steaming pots and lingering orders. Underneath the mayhem, accents from Romania, Australia, and Libya muddled into a coded language, incomprehensible to the untrained ear. In the back, Cosmin and I would scrape and load plates onto dishwasher trays at top speed, scrambling to keep them from piling up. We were a motley, underpaid crew, but connoisseurs of the commercial kitchen. Cosmin was my dishwashing mentor. I counted on him to snicker when I touched a hot tray and scold me when the silverware wasn\\'t polished. Between the clinking of pots and pans, we would exchange idle chatter\\\\u2014a brief escape from the tumultuous kitchen. What began as smalltalk, however, grew into conversations about our lives back home and how very different they were. Circumstance required that he forgo high school for a full-time job. Whereas for me, I\\'d be back in the classroom in just a few weeks. But that kitchen afforded something to us both.While I reveled in that foul-mouthed arena, a world away from my home in Brooklyn, this was Cosmin\\'s livelihood. I began to consider the strange economic undercurrents that had brought us to the same job, and I couldn\\'t help but feel a tinge of guilt. It was easy to wonder whether my job was taking someone else\\'s, and if I, a seventeen year-old New Yorker, really had the right to be there. At the same time, I wanted to explore the seemingly contradictory forces that had brought us both thousands of miles from home. At first, I sensed inefficiencies in the labor market. But resisting the impulse to lunge after certainty, I examined the convergence of people making up our staff. Complexities revealed themselves that I hadn\\'t noticed before. I could no longer picture an archetypal dishwasher or chef. Hailing from every corner of the world, each of our stories was every bit as unique, and each posed a plausible path to that kitchen. At Victoria\\'s, we were all the product of forces much bigger than ourselves, forces that I wanted to understand. Because behind market movements and employment data lie people, just like us, making choices within the parameters of our economic realities. I\\'ve never been content with abstract theories and hypotheses alone; I seek to anchor them in lived experiences, following bold lines of inquiry wherever they might lead, even if that means washing dishes for a summer in Scotland.This past summer, I interned at SelfMade, a technology startup in the midst of explosive growth. My time there inspired deep questions about the nature of management and team dynamics. On my first day, the CEO had me review the company\\'s \\'culture deck.\\' One slide stood out: it explained that we were there to \\'create something that is valuable for the world\\' and that the product should \\'have a positive impact by helping people express themselves.\\' Surprisingly, this wasn\\'t a glib excerpt from an investor pitch or marketing materials, but an internal document intended for our relatively small team. At SelfMade, I realized the importance of instilling a sense of purpose within a team. Just as marketing materials are crafted to sell products, internal messaging is crucial to inspire and motivate an organization. Through deliberate internal messaging, the CEO was developing a culture and identity for the growing company. So what makes some startups succeed while others fail? The answer to this question lies, at least in part, within a company\\'s culture. Drawing from my observations at SelfMade, I began thinking about how culture and values contribute to organizational effectiveness by shaping employee behavior. I started thinking about business from the perspective of the employee. These questions and ideas were at the forefront of my mind when I visited Cornell. It was a cold, rainy day when my mom and I made our way into a small auditorium to hear a panel of students. One of those students was an ILRie, and I remember listening in wonder as she described her favorite course: Labor Economics. Apart from maybe observing the unemployment rate, my interest in economics had never extended to the labor market. But as she described her areas of interest\\\\u2014like the dynamics of labor-force participation, the impact of various government programs, and the effects of unions\\\\u2014I realized that ILR presents both economic and management issues from the perspective of the worker. A major in Industrial and Labor Relations might propose solutions to the questions I had raised at SelfMade. When I was elected to lead my school\\'s Stock Market Club, I thought long and hard about how I could reposition the club to address the human side of finance. I wanted to divert attention away from esoteric trading strategies and get to the bottom of how financial institutions, products, and services affect people\\'s lives and contribute to the functioning of the economy. Finance is often understood only in the context of dollars and cents, maximizing the return on capital. But I wanted the club\\'s members to see finance as a set of tools that can incentivize productivity, allocate society\\'s limited resources, and sponsor ventures that bring people together. When designing the Stock Market Club, I explored how finance coordinates human activity on a large scale, and it\\'s through this lens that I view the world of markets and investment. At ILR, I would be able to examine the broad economic and structural forces that influence business activity and shape the workplace in classes such as Labor Economics or Development of Economic Thought and Institutions. My experiences working at SelfMade and leading the Stock Market Club helped me understand my interests. At SelfMade, I discovered the importance of culture and values when building an organization and began exploring management issues from the employee\\'s perspective. When leading Stock Market Club, I strived to emphasize the power of finance to organize and incentivize people; in other words, establish a connection between abstract concepts and human actors. Many people in my shoes might choose an economics or business degree, but I\\'m attracted to ILR\\'s unique emphasis on people and their livelihood. Modern economics is indebted to Adam Smith, whose \\'invisible hand\\' theory posits how self-interested, unconnected agents coalesce into well-formed structures that no single agent predicted, intended, or necessarily desired. In a stock market, for example, no single person or central authority is responsible for setting prices, yet public equity markets are incredibly efficient. This coherent, beautiful pattern of self-organization makes economics fascinating, but the phenomenon is not unique; a similar one occurs within another interest of mine, systems biology. To take an example from my AP Biology notebook, as ecological succession progresses, species diversify and total biomass increases. First, we find nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil, providing nutrients for grasses, herbs, and weeds. r-selected species then appear, which are eventually replaced by K-selected species. Just like in an economy, we see robust patterns of organization and complexity, absent an omniscient central authority. Economic and biological systems are both complex and adaptive; they emerge over scale and self-organize over time. I\\'m interested in studying the systems theory that may help explain complex interactions in the natural world. How does intelligent behavior emerge from ant colonies, animal herds, or schools of fish, despite no individual agent dictating how others should behave? How might this intelligent behavior help us understand the similarly well-formed structures that humans partake in? During my next four years, I hope to investigate questions like these by drawing from the many wells of human inquiry and thought. \\\\u2014\\\\u2014\\\\u2014\\\\u2014\\\\u2014 At USC, I plan on dual majoring in economics and business administration in order to build a deep understanding of business dynamics. By studying the liberal arts alongside business, I\\'ll develop both a theoretical and practical understanding of market dynamics, financial theory, and strategic interactions; it\\'s USC\\'s curricular flexibility that makes this possible. As I work towards a degree in economics in the Dornsife College of Arts and Sciences, I especially look forward to classes such as Games and Economics, where I\\'ll explore topics such as Prisoner\\'s Dilemma, rational decision making, and network game theory in the context of the economy. To extend my learning outside the classroom, I plan on joining the Undergraduate Economics Association and applying to Omicron Delta Epsilon, where I can engage in policy discussions, network with alumni, and meet fellow classmates with similar interests. By also pursuing a business degree, I can leverage Marshall\\'s plethora of experiential learning opportunities\\\\u2014like managing an equity portfolio for the Undergraduate Student Investment Fund or simulating strategic business thinking at the Experiential Learning Center. In the Department of Finance and Business Economics, I can integrate economic and financial theory to analyze asset-pricing, market efficiency, and resource allocation. With USC\\'s tremendous academic resources, myriad co-curricular opportunities, and vibrant community, I\\'ll be able to explore my passions and deepen my interests.\"}, {\"index\": 79, \"new_personal_statement\": \"We know you lead a busy life, full of activities, many of which are required of you. Tell us about something you do simply for the pleasure of it.I love to draw. When I draw, I\\'m in my own little world of creation. I put everything else aside and let my right brain do its thing. I feel free. It\\'s really relaxing and refreshing. I do all kinds of art: still life, detail, anime, fan art, animation, character design, and pretty much just anything that I feel like doing. I do art, because I love how I can take any idea in my head, pick up a pencil, and bring it to life.Although you may not yet know what you want to major in, which department or program at MIT appeals to you and why? I like programming, specifically solving problems with coding and creativity. I\\'m amazed by the MIT Game Lab\\'s research in solving problems with video games. Their research incorporates my three favorite subjects: art, psychology, and computer science. I played \\'Elude\\', their game created to illustrate the feeling of depression. The game was simple, but the playing experience was very real. I felt so many emotions and clearly understood the metaphor. I learned so much just from playing one game. Useful technology, like video games with a purpose, can help improve people\\'s lives, and I hope to be a part of it.Describe the world you come from; for example, your family, clubs, school, community, city, or town. How has that world shaped your dreams and aspirations?My parents raised me to be confident in myself. I grew up thinking that I can do anything that I set my mind to, as long as I believe in myself. Over time, I learned that the societal world can be different. Robots fascinate me, so I tried out our robotics team, but I felt ignored, possibly for being a girl. I enjoy playing video games, so I went to a summer program for video game design, but I had a similar difficulty dealing with gender stereotypes. Despite my experiences being outnumbered by boys, I still had fun learning and coding. A barrier exists for women entering STEM fields, but it shouldn\\'t be that way. I want to change that. The contrast between the \\'family world\\' I began with and the \\'societal world\\' I encountered inspired my dream of change. This dream was born at an all-girl coding workshop at Stanford. There, I learned perspective and behavioral differences between genders, and I was inspired by the success stories of girls in engineering. After the program, I applied and was selected to be a high school lead liaison for Girls Teaching Girls to Code, an organization run by female Stanford CS students to help close the gender gap in engineering. Women shouldn\\'t be afraid of being the minority, because we are just as capable and have the same, if not more, to contribute. I aspire to share my experiences and to support other girls to pursue their dreams in engineering.Tell us about the most significant challenge you\\'ve faced or something important that didn\\'t go according to plan. How did you manage the situation?Two summers ago, I attended a class at USC for video game design. I had no prior experience with programming or game design, and was the only girl. The boy next to me on day one switched his seat on day two. I was always last picked for the team projects. No one talked to me. It was frustrating... and infuriating inside. I wanted to have the full learning experience and be included. I tried to fit in. I started to play League of Legends and researched video game terminology so I could understand what the boys talked about and join their conversations. However, it didn\\'t work. Surprisingly, it was when I was being myself that I won them over.Most great games have repetitive background music. For my game, I found this hilarious looping meowing music. The meowing was awkwardly annoying, but in the context of a game, really amusing. The boys laughed at my ridiculously funny game audio and dubbed me the \\'cat girl\\'. Afterwards, they realized my ongoing contributions and slowly started to recognize me as an equal. They asked me if my next game would have cats in it, if my favorite animals are cats, and other random ice breaking cat-related questions. Towards the end of the program, I became friends with many of the boys. I successfully developed friendships despite gender differences. One classmate (currently a college student) even invited me to join his video game startup, and we have regular Skype meetings.\"}, {\"index\": 80, \"new_personal_statement\": \"And the Tree was HappyThis is a story that explains how a simple children\\'s book shaped my role in the world and resulted in new educational resources for children in Ladakh.I loved Shel Silverstein\\'s book, The Giving Tree, when I first read it. A seemingly straightforward story of a lifelong relationship between an unconditionally loving tree and a naive boy. While the boy ages and becomes more interested in pursuing material gains, the tree offers everything she has to meet his desires. In the end, the tree is reduced to only a stump, which she offers the boy (now an old-man) as a place to sit. From my second-grade eyes, I didn\\'t recognize the powerful message that each stage in the story ended with: \\'And the tree was happy.\\'Eight years later, while I was walking through the school library, I stumbled across this book again. Charged with excitement, I immediately opened the cover and began to read. The cover, the colors and the oversized illustrations - it all felt familiar to me; I was overcome with childhood memories. However, as I read with eyes now older than before, that sense of nostalgia was quickly replaced with dismay as I understood the story\\'s underlying darkness and its ulterior meaning. The joy I saw as a child was transformed into a toxic codependency. My mind now focused on the boy who seemed ungrateful and selfish as he kept using the tree, showing little emotional care in response. The story conveyed a sadly realistic tone that shook me. I realized I am little different from the boy, yet it was the tree who I admired. Ashamed, I embraced at that moment to not only offer gratitude for what I receive, but also to give back selflessly. My worldview up until that point was framed by my desire to experience something new, which brought me to an Indian boarding school, far from home. However, I was surrounded by a predominantly homogenous community and confined inside the lush compounds of the campus; almost like a prosperous island amidst a sea of despair. We would, for example, spend a lot on shopping at the market but not bat an eye towards begging children on the adjacent street. We only cared for what happened inside the gates of school. I had been no different than the boy in the book: through no effort of my own, I was given everything, yet I showed little gratitude and never aided others. My attitude changed after I re-read the book. No longer was I driven by selfish pursuits, but instead focused on achieving fulfillment through giving back to those in need. I was filled with a sense of purpose and regularly engaged in efforts in furtherance of that purpose\\\\u2014 recycling drives, volunteering at orphanages and rebuilding homes \\\\u2014 activities which I would never have been interested in doing before. The more I engaged in community service and helping others, the more I understood in practical terms the social injustices faced by those who, through no fault of their own, were underprivileged or discriminated against.To better rectify issues of injustice I routinely saw, I left India and joined United World College in Thailand. There, my vision of an interconnected, global community aligned with the student body\\'s objectives. Opportunities through the school\\'s funded programs made available experiences such as developing and leading a group trip to Ladakh where we educated local children and formed ongoing relationships with NGOs that shared my desire to enhance education there. Rereading The Giving Tree altered the course of my life, significantly shaped the person I am now and gave a roadmap for the person I want to be. I am no longer just the boy in the story but a fuller and more purposeful being. It has become the manifesto of my life. It has awakened me.And I am happy.\"}, {\"index\": 81, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I thought I could read my friends\\' minds as I left the land of the colorful lighting and the blasting music: \\'Come on, Chloe, don\\'t be so boring.\\' I always appeared stiff and uncomfortable at school dances.

My wrists feel like rubber, my throat like parchment. And yet, my focus is elsewhere.My right hand glides across the keys while the left keeps time to the pounding of the kick drum. I grope blindly with my foot for the damper pedal, which manages to slide away every time we hit a bump. I knew I should have taped it down last night, I scold myself. Duct tape may not fix everything, but it sure could improve my pedal work. It doesn\\'t help that the entire 8-by-10-foot trailer is trembling to Meghan\\'s drumbeat (I\\'m still not sure how we fit a drum kit, keyboards, speakers, and four musicians on that trailer).As we approach the end of our set, I scan the festive audience. It\\'s not your typical rock crowd. Imagine 32,000 suburbanites sprinkled, red-white-and-blue, along a two-mile stretch of road. But I have to return my concentration to the finale of an original called \\'Toxic.\\' Our set has built up to this moment, when my band must impeccably align the song\\'s final chords.E minor. Crash! G major. Crash! D diminished. We nail the final hit, and a chorus of \\'whoops\\' erupts from the crowd.Before I can feel relief, though, a wave of nervousness consumes me. Our repertoire is exhausted, yet at least a quarter mile remains in the parade, and the caravan of floats in front of us is at a standstill. \\'What do we do now?\\' I look anxiously at Adam, our guitarist. Even thirteen years of playing Chopin and Joplin and Liszt can\\'t prepare you for the moment you\\'re standing in front of thousands of spectators and are out of songs.I distinctly remember feeling the same pit in my stomach on the release day of my second mobile game, Duskfall. I had labored for months designing, programming, crafting graphics, and composing music. I had negotiated with seven game publishers before one finally responded \\'yes.\\'But then, just four hours before release time, my publisher Skyped with urgent news: many of the game\\'s files had been accidentally deleted from the latest version. I scrambled to reassemble the lost files, relying on my intuition and experience to recreate artwork and reprogram features. I finished the last graphic with twenty minutes left and uploaded the new version in time for Duskfall to be featured on the App Store across the world, from Germany to Ghana. I actually improved the game in those last hours\\\\u2014cleaner graphics, more efficient code\\\\u2014when I was forced to improvise under pressure.With these thoughts, I realize my band has prepared for this panicked moment. Every time we jammed to warm up or ad libbed a solo, we were preparing for this moment. Fortified, I turn to my bandmates. \\'Let\\'s wing it!\\' I shout. \\'Improvise in A.\\'I hear the drum sticks calling out \\'one-two-three-four,\\' and we dive in, with guitar, keyboard, bass, and drums all responding to each other like good friends. Our instruments are more in sync than ever, and we manage to end the improvisation on the exact same beat, without even glancing at each other.Improvisation is sometimes necessary to overcome a challenge, and once in a while, that spontaneity produces surprising innovation. As I learned, although improvisation can\\'t be planned for, it can be prepared for\\\\u2014whether by practicing an instrument or honing programming skills\\\\u2014and relied on to handle an unexpected obstacle. In college, I plan to study computer science or applied math, as well as music. As I combine my artistic and technical interests in new ways, as I have done through game development, I will continue to value improvisation, and the power of a little duct tape.Only two weeks remained, and it hadn\\'t even moved.I\\'ll be honest: we were a rookie team; we had no idea what we were doing. As lead programmer, I had taught myself Java and written the code that would make our robot operate. But I had a problem: when I ran my code on the robot, an error message appeared. The chassis remained lifeless.Solving computer bugs can be tedious. But to me, there is something enticing about them, and the more stubborn the bug, the better. After attempting increasingly convoluted fixes for three weeks, however, I still hadn\\'t found a solution. One day, a mentor advised me to think simpler, a counterintuitive idea at the time. That insight pointed me toward the obvious-in-hindsight answer: I had to turn off my laptop\\'s Wi-Fi for the USB connection to work.That a mistake so simple can cause such a frustrating bug shows that the devil really is in the details. While developing my video game FlyFall, a bug causing the player to die spontaneously puzzled me for a week. The solution? Discovering a deleted quotation mark.After finally getting our robot driving, our mechanical lead, David, a good friend and a genius robot designer, congratulated me and motioned me to where he was welding a metal box designed to collect and score game pieces. \\'What do you think?\\' David inquired. \\'Other teams may laugh at how basic it is,\\' I chuckled. \\'But it might just work.\\'A week later at our inaugural competition, I was about to receive a definitive answer to David\\'s question. Everything was grander than I had imagined: the field was enormous; there were dozens of teams; and all those other robots\\\\u2014they were works of art, each replete with painted metal, intricate logos, and more motors and pneumatic pistons than I could count. Envious of the complexity of our rival robots, I prepared for the worst: if we manage to win one or two matches out of twelve, we\\'ll call it a success.But after our first match, I glanced upward at the scoreboard. Somehow, we had emerged victorious. Throughout the competition, we kept on winning, and I began to realize that our robot\\'s success was not in spite of its simplicity, but because of it. When other robots malfunctioned, ours persisted unfazed. As computer bugs disrupted other robots, my no-frills codebase never produced an error. While other drivers struggled to control their numerous mechanisms, we could focus on deftly maneuvering around obstacles. And because our bot was so lightweight, it was the speediest machine on the field. These advantages propelled us to the championship in our first-ever competition.In the next competition, a second-place seed and several awards advanced us to the State Championship, a feat nobody expected. Even more stunning, our team qualified for the World Championship in Houston, a rare achievement for any team, much less a rookie. Just as the solution to a computer bug is often the simplest, my team\\'s simple yet effective robot was a force to be reckoned with.There is a reason that mathematics pursues the shortest proof possible, that philosophy endeavors to explain our existence at the most fundamental level, and that efficient computer code is prized. In today\\'s complex world, a seemingly simple idea can have transformative impact; at the same time, a few minute errors can compound into vast problems. As our surprisingly successful rookie season taught me, designing systems with simplicity in mind is essential to prevent such snowball effects, a lesson I will carry forward into college and career. When addressing complex challenges, it is often better to just think simpler.\"}, {\"index\": 83, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Standing on the gray gate of the lower basement of San Francisco Marriott, I gazed at the large, loud hallway scattered with hundreds of people as their murmuring voices echoed inside my head.

The excitement stoked me enough to perform a little dance in front of my beanbag workstation.I immediately called up Devansh and said, \\'Hey man! Remember that showcase to which we\\'d submitted MicroGiant? It looks like they loved it! They\\'ve invited us to San Francisco on a sponsored trip!\\'He seemed as thrilled as I was. It was astonishing to find that only four teams from India had made it to the conference, the other three being professional game development studios! We were just two teenagers who picked video game development as a pastime last summer, and it had provided us with this golden opportunity.The development process wasn\\'t an easy ride. It was especially challenging to agree on little things mutually. What should be the color of the character\\'s hat? Devansh suggested deep crimson red, but I thought that vivid cardinal red would make a better choice. What to do now? In times like these, we made the process simpler by seeking advice from our gamer friends. After some quick researching and crunching opinion data, we came to a decision.\\'Wow, it can grow and shrink! Relativizing time and size is a genius idea!\\' \\'That character looks awfully cute. Did you guys design it yourselves?\\'As I demonstrated MicroGiant to a bunch of developers who had surrounded our stall, I remembered the movie scene when Steve Jobs presented the first Mac. The act of starting with a blank screen and spending hours designing, prototyping, and programming to create something admirable and worth appreciation by a game development community is one I cherish. But the real fruit of this toil was not just a video game which required an intangible character to grow, shrink and dodge obstacles. It was gaining a deeper knowledge of computer science and comprehending the value of teamwork. Attending this conference made me push past self-perceived barriers and experience personal freedom in an exotic locale. When I see a crowded room now, I pull back my shoulders and lift my chin up as a voice in my head says, \\'Bring it on!\\'Taking a metro and walking for 15 minutes through narrow zigzag alleys got me to my destination - a small rural school in South Delhi. The classrooms weren\\'t like regular ones. Students from different grades assembled in groups of five or six on floor mats and greeted me with a vibrant \\'Good Morning Sir!\\' when I first stepped into the room.I started working with Pratham, India\\'s largest NGO, in November \\'14 after I wanted to use my programming skills to give back to the society. I created a framework to digitize books and recorded my voice to bring life to the characters in the storybooks. Pratham publishes high-quality storybooks that reach far through collaborative efforts, yet children in remote locations cannot access the physical library. But these kids are connected to the world by a mode of global communication, namely, the Internet.Getting these kids to surround me, I showcased them the elements of the app - multilingual stories with interactive text, in-narrative quizzes and fascinating details about people and objects in the story. Every tap on the screen surprised them and even simple things like swiping to turn the pages left them filled with awe. I realized these children have never had access to technology. To them it was magical, and I was the magician performing this act. At one center, a group of little ladies decided to reciprocate by writing a story which featured me as the protagonist - a brave warrior prince. However minor an incident, it was one of the events I will never forget. These kids learned new facts from the app, but I learned a lot more. The most important of them was appreciating every small thing in life. These children thank God and their Parents for every day they can go to school, every new thing they learn, and every book they can read. It is one thing I could never have learned in school or any textbook. That\\'s how I started my journey with Pratham Books; something that I never thought could change my perspective of the world around me.I was inducted into the Exun Clan, the school\\'s computer club, in freshman year of high school.\\'We, Not I.\\'This three syllable phrase, which seemed humorous to me at that time, was the motto of the club. It was absurd that a computer club would have such a slogan; it was not even a little bit related to technology! I dismissed it with only a fleeting thought. Little did I know that this same three syllable phrase would shape my opinion, introduce in me: grit, passion, and hone my intellectual vitality.As I began representing Exun in competitions, I spent plenty of time thinking about what made me look the best in the club. I was seen at the team\\'s wins, but I subtly shied away from taking ownership of the team\\'s losses. However, my association with seniors in Exun slowly helped me discover the secret of the club\\'s success: every member of the club stuck to this motto, putting \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018We\\' instead of \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018I\\' in each and everything. \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018We\\' celebrated success and graciously admitted defeat. \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018We\\' won quizzes and swept global hackathons. \\'We\\' solved problems and brought glory to our school. Everything we did took place under the name of \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Exun,\\' and not under any particular member\\'s name. It was this unity that bound us. In the best and the worst of times, it brought us all closer and made us a large 75 member plus family. I gradually began to realize the significance of this phrase, which was the very foundation of the Clan. We could accomplish nearly anything set in front of us.Four years later, as the President of Exun, I can proudly say that I was part of something grand, something marvelous. I have had the honor to interact with a legacy of remarkably gifted, stellar, and motivated people. This association is something that sets me apart. At the risk of seeming too dramatic, I\\'d like to say that all this could not have been possible without the incredibly humbling words, which I now live by: \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018We, not I.\\'It was a warm summer day - the perfect time to go roller skating in the community ring, but no one was interested in the weather. Instead, the family huddled around Grandma who lay on the ground, unable to move. She breathed with short, harsh sounding gasps while her face pinched as she lay on her back. Unshed tears clenched to her eyes as she struggled to speak and all that came out of her mouth were unclear words.We lovingly called Grandma as \\'Ma.\\' It was a regular morning when Ma started her day with daily chores. Suddenly, she lost consciousness and fell. We hurried to her and knew from her face that it was bad. That was when I realized what just happened. Her condition spurred me into action. First aid lessons taught in school came to my mind, and I knew what to do. I took a deep breath and calmed down myself. I told my brother to call 102 and request an ambulance immediately. I turned Ma on her side in a supported position while I directed my sister to cover her with a warm blanket to prevent heat loss from her body. After ensuring Ma was in a safe posture, we lifted her up and transferred her to bed. As we patiently waited for help to show up, the severity of the moment sunk in. I acted calmly under pressure and made sure Ma was a little more comfortable.Tackling this situation is one of the most significant challenges I have ever faced. I liked feeling skilled enough to help Ma. I learned to value the gift of life and every person around me. I learned to accept things which are not under my control and adore every moment. Academically, It motivated me to make the best of every single course that I took. In an attempt to recover, Ma is undergoing physical therapy these days. Seeing her trying to balance herself on her legs brings a grin on my face as I cheer for her, \\'Come on, Ma! You can do it!\\'Standing on the gray gate of the lower basement of San Francisco Marriott, I gazed at the large, loud hallway scattered with hundreds of people as their murmuring voices echoed inside my head. Looking at these many people sent chills down my spine. Will any of them even like what we\\'d made? I reassured myself with the fact that I shared a little hobby with these people.I spotted six display boards, sprinted up to each of them and hurriedly moved down my finger below the engraved names on these radiant surfaces. On the third one, I found the name of the game that my friend Devansh and I had developed. As I walked up to our booth, Number 86, with Devansh, our neighbor, Yuliya, greeted us.\\'What\\'s your game called, boys?\\' Yuliya asked. \\'MicroGiant,\\' I replied. Representing the Ukraine, Yuliya was a gritty woman who exuded immense passion while showcasing her game The Lost Bubble and critically analyzing the creations of other video-game fanatics around. The Lost Bubble was about guiding a bubble back home by switching between the states of water. We felt a profound connection between our creations because the fundamental ideas behind our games were the same. In fact, whenever someone was attracted to MicroGiant, we\\'d lead them to Yuliya\\'s booth first. I had spent the summer of my senior year interning at a tech-startup which turned selfies into humorous digital bobblehead stickers.

Printed in bright orange Crayola marker on freckled skin, the message read, \\'Merry Christmas Ms. Deeny!\\' The \\'card\\' was adorned with a charmingly messy sketch of a tree and my misspelled name. As Lauren raised her arm, I laughed. \\'How am I going to keep this?\\' She pouted. \\'Can\\'t you take me to your house?\\' That\\'s Lauren for you. Then there\\'s Kevin, who refuses to sit on the carpet in order to keep his pants clean; Chloe, who wears frilly dresses and crosses her ankles; Maddie and Lily, who are \\'sisters, not twins\\'; and Benjamin, whose glasses can\\'t stay on his face. They are some of the lovely students who make up my favorite day of the week.As a member of Blackhawk Church\\'s Children\\'s Ministries team, I leave my house at 10:35 every Sunday morning, exactly half an hour before we open the ministry doors. I set up my group\\'s stand and double check my supplies: Bibles in the green drawer, craft supplies in the blue, emergency kit in the red. Volunteers huddle for prayer at 10:55, and then we return to our large activity room to welcome the children. When the kids arrive, everything turns into disarray. The room is suddenly filled with flurries of surprises. \\'Katy has a football down her shirt!\\' \\'Benjamin is chewing on the pom-poms!\\' \\'Where did the rest of your kids go?\\' And my favorite, \\'Deney, where did that dog come from?\\' I\\'m used to the chaos by now. But when I first joined Children\\'s Ministries in 9th grade, I was continually startled by unanticipated circumstances. Many eight year olds, I discovered, were not very good at following directions. Exhaustive arrangements for activities crumbled when kids conceived their sudden games of \\'Follow-the-Leader,\\' or \\'Chase-Jimmy,\\' or simply, \\'Scream.\\' I often stood at the sidelines, amid multicolored Lego bricks and towers of Dominoes, unsure of what to do. My meticulously thought-out lesson plans were supposed to be my support, my crutch. But amidst the lists of details, the plans never explained how to quiet yelling students, or remove Elmer\\'s glue from hair, or catch a bouncing service dog. In those first few weeks, I realized the lesson could not account for all the possible difficulties that might arise. Slowly, I learned to think on my feet. I organized spontaneous scavenger hunts for misplaced supplies and led lessons by a bathroom so I could stay near a sick student without abandoning my group. I gave a piggyback ride down the stairs to a student with a knee injury and scrubbed orange Crayola marker off a young girl\\'s arms (and legs and hands) \\\\u2014although her Christmas message was quite heartwarming. When needed, I played the role of an older sister, a guardian, a teacher, a cheerleader. The lesson plan was no longer a checklist I needed to adhere to; instead, it became a general guideline for the potential of my lessons and my interactions with students.Through my life, I have faced countless adversities. But like boat sails that adjust to ever-changing winds, I mustn\\'t dwell on obstacles that lay in front of me, and instead, adapt and move forward. Although I continue to plan ahead for Children\\'s Ministries, my weekly schedules, family vacations, and other upcoming affairs, I\\'ve learned to take detours when my plans don\\'t cater to ever-changing circumstances. I\\'ll think and act outside the limitations of an agenda. Now, I look at my students\\' quirky and impromptu behavior with fondness. Their fiery energy taught me that life may stray from my prior arrangements, but with a little flexibility and creativity, I am able to face, and surmount, any difficulty. \"}, {\"index\": 85, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Will DeLorean-esque time machines ever roam the universe, traversing time and space at 88 miles-per-hour? Will wrinkled, blanket-clad aliens actually fit snugly into bicycle baskets? Will my mother\\'s Honda Pilot ever join an army of vehicles that metamorphose into giant, destructive robots? Such questions blossomed in my brain almost immediately when I recently learned that the atomic bomb, space travel, and the moon landing\\\\u2014among other scientific advancements\\\\u2014had all been prefigured in science fiction novels, some even centuries old.I used to believe that science fiction is perhaps just as far away as you could get from actual science. As a literary genre most frequently associated with paranormal abilities and nuclear armageddon, science fiction would seem an unlikely source of predictions about the future of legitimate scientific research. Nevertheless, history actually does show that some of the surrealistic fabrications of science fiction may one day emerge as scientific fact.Thus, I thought to myself: Would some light sci-fi reading help facilitate the arduous, sometimes decades-long, process of amassing traditional scientific research? After all, every scientist knows that failure is endemic to the scientific process. Even the slightest mishap\\\\u2014measurements off by .0001 mm, solutions a tad too diluted, or samples contaminated by a single speck of dust\\\\u2014can completely ruin an experiment, prolonging the process of data collection by years. With failure always looming in the background, perhaps scientists should question the biases of conventional science and consider the unlikely to produce desirable results.On top of their susceptibility to failure, scientists are taught to be skeptics, to only accept theories validated by a hefty amount of evidence. Indeed, as an aspiring scientist, I have long attempted to adopt this same mindset. Though skepticism is key in science, I have found that scientists occasionally become overly dismissive of every bold idea that arises. Perhaps scientists should take note from the likes of the fictional Dr. Emmett Brown of \\\\u200bBack to the Future fame, who has incited my fascination in science\\'s limitless bounds with his distinct disregard of the conventionally impossible. Scientists ought to consider and investigate the absurd, and allow the scientific method to identify the impossible initiative.This phenomenon between what was previously considered impossible and what was not has propelled me to consider monumental scientific discoveries that were completely discarded for lack of widespread support in the scientific community. The narrative is familiar: a brilliant but \\'blasphemous\\' theory is proposed\\\\u2014heliocentrism, the atom, evolution\\\\u2014and effectively tossed in the scientific garbage can for decades, if not longer. Consider what would have happened if longstanding theories had never been challenged with ideas that were considered nonsensical. Would pilots cross the Atlantic in straight lines under the belief that the globe is flat? Would NASA send scientists into space to monitor the Sun\\'s orbit around the Earth?However, science fiction itself is not capable of kindling the eureka moment of discovery. Though the theoretical creativity present in science fiction should be emulated in the actual world, science fiction itself cannot possibly take part in the grueling labor of scientific experimentation. However brilliant or novel an idea might be, its validity cannot be affirmed by mere words on a page; only a thorough application of the scientific method can establish the truth, as I have discerned myself through conducting experiments of my own.Thus, perhaps the most sensible resolution to the apparent conflict between science and science fiction is to integrate the most valuable aspects of both disciplines- the strict, exacting practice of the scientific method interlaced with the unrestricted theoretical speculation of science fiction. And so, as I embark on my academic and professional career, I will arm myself with knowledge not only of cell structures, but also of sci-fi history and trivia. After all, my groundbreaking discovery might surface from microscope slides or even page 94 of the latest science fiction bestseller.\"}, {\"index\": 86, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Out of the blue one lunchtime, my friend punched me.\\'Ow, Kristie, abs of steel?\\' She recoiled, shaking out her knuckles. The circle of people standing around us tittered.\\'Plastic,\\' I corrected. Part of me wanted to disappear into the ground. On the other hand, I was basically the Man of Steel in real life. I laughed along instead.I was a hard(y) fourth grader\\\\u2014literally. When I was nine, my doctor told me I had scoliosis and put me in a thick plastic brace that stiffly bound my upper body. \\'Wear it 23 hours a day every day for the next five years,\\' he warned, \\'or risk open-back surgery.\\' I had no choice but to drop out of dance and sit out of class activities. Throughout middle school, I waddled when I ran, and couldn\\'t even bend over to pick up a pencil. It embarrassed me to be so conspicuously clumsy and different in my plastic-encased world.I realized, even at my young age, that conquering my new world required more than just positive thinking. In order to stay sane and to keep up, I had to make a choice. I could stay stuck, deprived of my former life, or I could pursue new interests in the broader world around me. If dancing was no longer an option for me, I could dedicate my efforts to the art studio instead. If I couldn\\'t swim, I could teach myself interface design. And in the time I spent sitting out of class activities, I wrote a petition. In 2016, I urged my state governor to prioritize early scoliosis intervention and reinstate mandated screenings in elementary schools. The petition garnered almost 10,000 signatures and inspired hundreds of stories and comments by readers.As my growth slowed, my plastic brace was relegated to the back of my closet, but even today I feel its effects on my attitude, mindset, and thinking. It taught me to be forward-thinking and pragmatic, rather than burying myself in negativity. It taught me that I could be proactive in adapting to difficulties. And it taught me to have no fear of taking risks and trying new things in tough situations. So when my fashion business venture was running out of money and time, I drastically revamped our marketing strategy from social media to affiliate partnerships. When my school\\'s creative magazine was nearly shut down, I was willing to try free, online distribution. My venture now maintains relationships with large international retailers, and the creative magazine receives three times the submissions and has a hundredfold more readers than before.As much as I disliked it growing up, my brace (which now collects dust under my socks cubby) taught me to keep adapting, especially in times when I felt like I couldn\\'t. Some might call it optimistic; others call it sensible. I\\'ve learned to roll with whatever difficulty I encounter\\\\u2014just like the Man of Steel\\\\u2014with or without my plastic brace.I\\'ve learned that a successful leader has to be willing to take risks. So, like any good editor-in-chief, I arrived at school on recruitment day as a walking billboard, dressed in a red tutu, a sandwich board, and black stilettos. Why? Pandora\\'s Box Creative Magazine was a failing club. After twenty years, our school\\'s only magazine was threatened with shutdown for lack of membership. As an officer sophomore year, I knew the problem was the exclusionary, cliquish environment established by previous leadership. When I was elected Editor-in-Chief the next year, and in the wake of a campus suicide, I set out to cultivate a different sort of club environment and reputation. Recruitment day, I knew, would set the tone for the year. I gave my twelve officers free rein over my outfit for the day; the only requirement was flamboyance. For the rest of the year, I strove to make our meetings equally as fun and welcoming.In the meantime, I endeavored to improve the magazine\\'s accessibility to the entire school community. After some roundtable debate, I decided to make distribution free and digital. This was risky; it was unprecedented in the magazine\\'s history and we were already low on budget. Logistical and financial difficulties riddled production of our first issue, but we were met with a hundredfold increase in readership and an overwhelming welcome from the student body.For the second issue, we focused on inclusivity, incorporating as much student work as possible. Our layout team eventually assembled 99 pages of submissions, the most Pandora\\'s Box had ever published. Because the first issue had been so widely distributed and welcomed, many students felt more comfortable sharing personal, sensitive topics in our magazine. I\\'m proud of the work my team and I did to create a safe space in my school community. Leadership, I learned, isn\\'t just about delegating duties\\\\u2014it\\'s being willing to look beyond logistics, inspiring my team to invest in a vision, and doing whatever is necessary to help those around me succeed. Sometimes, it\\'s turning up in a red tutu and stilettos, if that\\'s what it takes.From the age of four, I believed I was destined to become an oil painter. I was essentially fostered for twelve years in a small, unventilated art studio, and trained myself to approach artistic problems from multiple angles\\\\u2014imagining results, testing, making choices, and revising.At the dinner table, my father, my younger brother, and I frequently talked tech, discussing topics such as the parallels between cryptocurrency and the Dutch tulip mania. I was especially curious about product design and development, but while I had many years training as an artist, I had no programming experience. I decided to spend eight weeks of my sophomore-year summer at the Make School Summer Academy, learning to develop and design apps.The constant creative decision-making of product development made it feel a lot like making art\\\\u2014except with an incredibly powerful and flexible added functionality. I later teamed up with one of my peers to build and co-found a weather-based fashion app and business venture. For months, we immersed ourselves in a cycle: brainstorm, design, develop, repeat. The next summer, I attended the UPenn Management & Technology Summer Institute, where I learned about business principles such as hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship, lean startups, and design thinking. Just as I had improved my paintings by learning to draw, with every new piece of knowledge I became better at making creative decisions, whether it was financials or the development timeline.When, for example, we needed to revamp our venture\\'s marketing strategy, I studied the problem from various perspectives and considered options, imagining how each might work. Ultimately, we chose to cut our advertising campaign and pursued affiliate partnerships instead. We now maintain relationships with retail giants Garage Clothing and Dynamite Clothing. My twelve years of artistic training have taught me to always consider new perspectives and to problem-solve creatively. I am prepared to navigate any technical, artistic, or social challenge, no matter how ambiguous or complex the problem. Though I may no longer intend to spend my life in an art studio, I know the skills I learned there will be present in everything I do.When I attended the Yale Young Global Scholars program, what I found most fascinating was how current international affairs and domestic industries were increasingly intertwined. As I devised a policy proposal for the recent Sino-American trade war, for example, I began by examining its repercussions on American industries\\\\u2014particularly agriculture. But after researching the issue, I realized the conflict\\'s effect on American farmers led me directly to the effects on farmers in South America and the European Union, who were able to undermine the United States\\' influence on Chinese agricultural imports. When it came to trade, I discovered, national boundaries didn\\'t mean much. Such issues could only be understood from a global perspective.At my third Model UN conference, the most pressing problem we faced wasn\\'t climate change or poverty; just as in the real world, it was deadlock. During debate about ocean preservation, for example, each country voted exclusively to forward their national agendas, no matter the cost to global relations or the planet. Landlocked Afghanistan, for instance, didn\\'t care about the same issues that countries like multi-coastal Canada worked on so diligently, so each and every proposed motion failed to achieve majority vote.I realized, however, that this predicament wasn\\'t so much about the specific problem being discussed as it was a structural issue; majorities were never achieved because the individual countries shared little common ground. Evaluating the issue from a more global standpoint, I proposed the implementation of subcommittees based on geographic location and shared interests. The idea was adopted nearly unanimously, \\'unlocked\\' the deadlock, and recatalyzed the collaborative energy in the room. We were able to start resolving issues and moving on to others.In this increasingly interconnected world, I realized, virtually all issues are global issues. To be a powerful agent of change, I\\'ll need to grasp the intricate links\\\\u2014economic, political, scientific, climatic\\\\u2014that tie together all nations and systems. Whatever I choose to study, I know I\\'ll have to understand every issue and solution in the context of the world, and I will bring this global perspective to share with my community at my UC school.Out of the blue one lunchtime, my friend punched me. \\'Ow, Kristie, abs of steel?\\' She recoiled, shaking out her knuckles. The circle of people standing around us tittered.\\'Plastic,\\' I corrected. Part of me wanted to disappear into the ground; part of me wanted to claim I was the Man of Steel in disguise.I was a hard(y) fourth grader\\\\u2014literally.

My thoughts were always fully formed, but the words would get stuck. The harder I tried to force them out, the more they would jam up, like train cars going off a track. Sometimes kids would laugh or make fun of my stutter, but mostly they just ignored me. They had better things to do than wait to hear my ideas, so they assumed I had none worth hearing. Eventually, I gave up talking to people entirely. They thought I was stupid, and soon enough, I thought so too.My parents signed me up to play soccer in the hopes that being part of a team would help me make friends. I wasn\\'t particularly athletic, and I could barely kick a ball. But soccer is a game anyone can play. On the field, my stutter didn\\'t matter. I discovered that I could lead, quietly, through action rather than words. Eventually, speech therapy resolved my stutter, but it was on the soccer field that I learned how to be me. One of my teammates had a brother with Down Syndrome. Every season, he came to our games to watch from the sidelines. He had cleats and a ball that he kicked around by himself, but because he also had an intellectual disability, there was no room for him on our team or anywhere else. I realized that although soccer is a sport for everyone, not everyone is included in the sport.I understood the pain of being excluded simply because of an inability to communicate. So, in February of 2015, I launched GOALS (Giving Opportunities to All who Love Soccer), a unified soccer program for kids with and without special needs. GOALS partners youth athletes who have intellectual disabilities with neurotypical peer buddies. The athletes and buddies play together, as unified pairs, in small-sided, non-competitive scrimmages. The first GOALS program had just nine participants. Today, we hold GOALS events twice a month for fifty players of all abilities. GOALS has impacted over 400 kids and is now an official partner of Special Olympics Arizona. But I don\\'t measure the success of GOALS by the numbers. Success comes in the form of an athlete like Micah, who came reluctantly to his first GOALS event, having never tried sports before, preferring instead to play video games by himself. Micah was surprised to find that he loves soccer, and he looks forward to playing with his friends at every GOALS event, where his diagnosis of autism doesn\\'t define him.What makes GOALS special is that it is not a community service program for kids with intellectual disabilities. GOALS is a program that serves the entire community, understanding that our community includes people of all abilities. GOALS champions people for what they bring to the community, rather than defining them by what they take. GOALS breaks down the barriers that separate kids with special needs from their neurotypical peers, creating intentional connections that allow true friendships to develop. For many kids, GOALS is the first time they experience genuine acceptance. Through sports, we have the capacity to create something better than tolerance. Tolerance is for summer heat, visits to the doctor\\'s office, and lines at the bank. People, though, deserve more than tolerance. People deserve acceptance. So often, kids with intellectual disabilities are isolated socially, for no other reason than that kids pass them by. But special needs kids can be incredibly smart and talented. We just need to slow down long enough to get to know them. Some need more time to turn their ideas into words, but we can afford to have those slower conversations. That is why, for me, unified sports will be a lifelong passion. Through sports, anyone can communicate that each of us is valued, each of us is a part of the team, and each of us is a friend worth having.\"}, {\"index\": 88, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Every time I place an order at Starbucks, I change my name. Placing an order with a new name gives me a rush of adrenaline, something to spice up my monotonous daily routine. Instead of just being Mumba, I could be anyone.

Unbeknownst to me, I was distancing myself from my culture and origins, erasing all ties to the country my parents immigrated from. After ordering a grande green tea frappuccino under the name \\'Rihanna\\', I further ruminated why I tended to hide my culture, including telling others that I\\'m from South Africa instead of Zambia. I used fake identities as a defense mechanism to compensate for the shame I felt about my cultural origins. I constantly felt uncomfortable in my own skin, itching to shed it and don a new one, with the hope of blending in with everyone around me. However, no matter how hard I tried, I never blended in. In elementary school, kids would poke and prod at my unusual name. After a particularly rough day of fourth grade, I remember crying to my father, imploring why he would curse me with an unusual name. He began to tell me tales of his friends and family, but mostly focused on my grandmother, whom I was named after but never had the chance to meet. My dad\\'s face immediately lit up\\\\u2014 his expressions and gestures became more and more animated as his accounts of my grandmother continued on. In his stories he would paint her as the heroine who slayed the dragon, a woman of such strength and tenacity. She was always portrayed as someone who was both courageous and audacious, compassionate yet fierce. I then realized that these were qualities my dad desired me to inherit. Working as a housekeeper and earning barely livable wages, my grandmother toiled for hours every single day to care for her five children. Her ambition to pursue higher education while balancing menial jobs and give her children a better life than she herself had is what motivated her to wake up every morning and repeat her grueling routine. Her ambition inspires me to defy the odds, much like she did, and defy stereotypes about what I can and cannot achieve.By bestowing me with a name that holds such valiant qualities, my dad\\'s only intention was to pass down these virtuous traits to me so that I could face life as a heroine equipped with the proper tools to tackle any challenge I encounter. My seemingly simple 5-letter, 2-syllable name is instilled with much more power than I had ever imagined. Rather than being burdened with a curse, I was blessed with a name; redolent of qualities that I aspire to inherit to further my personal growth and development.For most of my life, I subscribed to the label \\'artistically challenged.\\' I had always written myself off as not only lacking in artistic ability, but also creativity. Until I signed up for graphic design solely to fulfill my art requirement to graduate, I had always perceived artists as people who are hidden behind easels, slaving away at canvases meticulously graced by acrylic paint. My graphic design class was the last place I expected to find fascination, but as the course progressed I found myself growing more and more engrossed in the subject matter. I began evolving into an artist myself; the very thing I dissociated myself from. Instead of an easel, I found myself tucked away behind a computer screen, diligently crafting my latest project. I began to develop a new approach to assignments both in graphic design and outside the classroom (or computer lab). I tackle each challenge I encounter with newfound persistence and determination that sprouted from my recently developed creative thought process. Digital paint brushes enable me to express my thoughts, ideas, and perspectives through a medium void of our typical means of communication- words. Graphic design opened my eyes not only to the aesthetic side of art, but allowed me to view art as a form of communication. Through this class, I began to understand and appreciate how art is able to transcend language barriers and evoke human emotion. I quickly why visual art is a mandatory class; learning about art and the creative process allows students to open their minds to a different style of thinking, and draw out their creative sides. While graphic design is not a field that I envision myself pursuing, I believe there is tremendous value in continuing to learn more about the form. As someone who aims to pursue a career with an international focus, language barriers pose a threat to mutual understanding. The ability to clearly express ideas to the entire world regardless of language, gender, and cultural barriers is an advantageous skill in our increasingly global world. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.Every February, members of my community and over half of my school gather on the football field in order to participate in our annual cancer fundraiser, Walk for Life. Braving the chill of California\\'s 67-degree winter, students, faculty, and local residents assemble to commemorate those who have lost their battles to cancer and recognize those who are still tirelessly fighting.I\\'ve participated in Walk for Life since eighth grade,and it is an experience near and dear to me, due to its immense impact in my community. Even though I\\'m not rewarded with any class credit or service hours, year after year I still choose to serve as an ambassador for the cause. The fundraiser not only involves students and local residents, but teachers and local businesses who all come together to enact change not only in our community, but in the lives of cancer patients, survivors, and their families across Southern California. As an ambassador, I contact local businesses to participate in our cause and recruit students to share their experiences with cancer. I also search for hairdressers to help with hair donations and hunt down purple roses (which are surprisingly difficult to find) for the somber yet emotional rose ceremony honoring cancer victims. As someone who has fortunately never experienced the tragedy of losing a loved one to cancer, I find it strange how deeply I connect with the fundraiser. The impact of hosting a fundraiser that specifically supports pediatric cancer patients and their families is what motivates me to continue serving as an ambassador for Walk for Life. Last year, I had the opportunity to visit those who were directly impacted by the money we had raised. I spent an entire day talking, playing, and laughing with kids in the Pediatric Cancer Center of City of Hope. Being able to actually interact with the kids whose lives were improved by the fundraiser we held was an eye-opening experience. Even though I am just one person, I still have the power to enact change, no matter how small, in my community and beyond.Every time I place an order at Starbucks, I change my name. Instead of just being Mumba, I could be anyone. In an instant I could evolve into a character from the latest book I was reading; I could be an astronaut, a celebrity, or even the president. As I waited in line one afternoon, contemplating who I wanted to be that day, I started to question why I was so eager to change my name. Why waste time meticulously spelling out \\'Mumba\\' and enunciating each letter only for the barista to still butcher my simple 5-letter, 2-syllable name and mistakenly call out \\'Matthew!\\' when my drink is ready?

The smell of cumin, saut\\\\u00e9ed garlic and onions overpowers my senses. We are ready. It\\'s time. Game on. The game is Rummikub, a board game played with domino-like tiles. Each player draws 14 tiles to place on a rack. The object is to put down all your tiles by either forming ladders of the same color, or pairs of different colors. The first to do so claims victory and yells Rummikub. While the premise is simple, victory is not.I assemble my tiles and see almost no correlation, making the task of winning seem daunting. As my family begins dropping tiles, I sense my window closing. I need to form something out of nothing. I stay calm; I\\'ve been here before. I remember this past January when I found scraps of wood in my yard deemed for the junkyard. With no experience, I decided to build my 13-year-old dachshund, Milo, a state-of-the-art doghouse with a sunroof and memory foam. Three weeks and countless hours later, Milo hated it. I was crushed, yet still felt accomplished. \\'You got this,\\' I tell myself. After my grandmother yells \\'no m\\\\u00e0s,\\' I see a possibility and drop a few tiles. Ten tiles remain. I visualize my moves and create an elaborate series of movements that will take six tiles off my rack. My plan is perfect, until my grandmother steps in, shuffles the tiles and leaves me with nothing. I throw her a scowl, and she throws one right back. I refuse to let her ruin my play. I recall my junior year when I was determined to start on my Varsity tennis team. Five games in, I had yet to see playing time. I was devastated. Instead of wallowing on the bench, I embraced it. If all the action I was going to get was setting out the water bottles, snacks and keeping track of score, then I was going to make sure I was the best water boy the team ever had. During my time on the bench, I\\'m proud to say not one player fainted from dehydration or malnourishment. With that same mindset, I remain enthusiastic. I glance once more at my tiles, reset my perspective and move forward. Six tiles remain.Six! My lucky number. I just need one or two good moves to win. Now is the time to unleash my secret weapon, the joker. The joker is the most valuable tile in the game and can be substituted for any tile come crunch time. In life, I\\'d like to think of myself as a special joker. Am I a great dancer? No. Do I excel in every subject? No, but I try. Do I make the best omelets west of the Mississippi? You betcha! I also bring something unique to the table. I am the youngest of three, a hiking enthusiast, a proud member of a Cuban and Puerto Rican family, a loud talker, a fan of 2-in-1 shampoo, a decent tennis player, and a great ping-pong player. I\\'ve learned to embrace my individuality and use it to my advantage in the game of life. More than just a game, Rummikub represents quality time with family, friends and a fondness for competition. Whether it is memorizing patterns, devising strategies or perfecting the art of patience, this game has nurtured my love of numbers and allowed me to excel in mathematics. It\\'s a game about life and the choices we make. Success is not always about winning, but rather how we compete. With that in mind, I glance at my joker, and then my grandmother. I know how much winning means to her, so I pass. Moments later, she shouts \\'Rummikub!\\'\"}, {\"index\": 90, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'What? You don\\'t use Windows? Not even a Mac?!\\' At this point, at the risk of sounding like an evangelist, I explain that I am using Linux, a free and libre operating system, unlike Windows and macOS, the 2 other more well-known operating systems on the market today.My decision to leap into the world of Linux began when Microsoft was rolling out its newest edition of Windows, Windows 10. The upgrade initially had me excited - who doesn\\'t love the newest and greatest? Yet, as I read more about this upgrade, alarm bells started to ring. It tracked your computer usage extensively and reported it back to Microsoft in the form of \\'analytics\\' that couldn\\'t be turned off. Some users reported that it was changing their default browser to Microsoft Edge. It even had ads baked into it in the form of notifications!Our personal data - what you spend on, who you talk to, when you open up Outlook to start doing work - has turned into a commodity, and I wanted to be no part of the harvest. Linux has a reputation for strong privacy protection and is also known for being an extremely powerful operating system to use. Now, the time seemed ripe to check out what all the fuss is about and even move to Linux for good.Perhaps the toughest challenge is that when things go wrong, there is no support hotline you can call and send in your computer to have it magically fixed. You could put up a question on a forum and hope someone who knows exactly what is going on reads it and answers your question. I became self-sufficient instead. I fixed my issues by poking around, researching them extensively on the internet, and trying out solutions that made sense.This troubleshooting process got me hooked. It sounds a bit masochistic to put it in words, but I actually relished discovering problems in my computer, just so I had an excuse for myself to go explore the system\\'s deepest, most forsaken depths. It\\'s not unlike opening up a wristwatch to admire and learn how each gear, each axle, and each motor interact in an intricate dance to display the time in order to find the one malfunctioning part. I loved reading up on scary Greek sounding topics such as daemons and finding out where its place in the overall architecture is. I loved making the smallest tweaks all over the place so the computer ran that little bit faster, smoother, and more efficiently. I loved that Linux trusted me enough to give me total control and absolute say on how I run my own computer.Without realising it, this understanding of Linux put me in good stead for CDDC, a national cyber defence competition. I was put in charge of securing the Linux server our team was defending while the remainder went out in pursuit of more offensive objectives. Intuitively, I could foresee where the weak spots were and what needed hardening as a result. By poking around in our server, I was able to find security holes planted by the organisers such as SSH misconfigurations and fix them before they could be exploited. Our server held out and was never breached, and we emerged as champions in CDDC.When I first made the move from Windows to Linux, I could never have thought it would be so much more than just a migration. It taught me how to be self-sufficient, how to teach myself, and how to persevere and think through tough problems systematically.As part of the 1.7% of the global population who uses Linux, I am proud of my unique choice of operating system and have never turned back. As long as Linux continues to align with my philosophy of liberty and flexibility, I don\\'t think I ever will make another migration again.\"}, {\"index\": 91, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Heavy cream and powdered sugar. With the 8:1 ratio that I had experimented to fit my preferences, these simple ingredients form the recipe for whipped cream. Attempting to soothe my persistent craving for sugar, I was determined to follow my adapted strawberry layer cake recipe\\\\u2014excluding the strawberries and cake. Admittedly, I was whisking together an entire bowl of cream for myself.As dense cream gushed into the bowl, the dust of sugar powder sifted through my sieve, blanketing the cream in a soft snow. Beating the two components together using my trusty handheld mixer, I grew mesmerized by the creamy combination churning thick. Captivated, I let the sweet sight last too long.A concoction of mistakes cooked up one unfortunate disaster. My extensive whisking reduced the silky mixture to a milky liquid with yellow chunks resembling scrambled eggs. Excited splashes hit my sweatshirt, the floor, and my face. My mom gawked, horrified, but I remained optimistic. I figured I had either spoiled my ingredients or created something different.After numerous Google searches, I discovered that I had actually churned butter by rupturing the membranes of milk fat. The fat globules aggregated, joining with air bubbles to form a network of foam, and the foam leaked when surface-active phospholipids and lipoproteins were destabilized through the coalescence of air bubbles. Hugging the bowl, I felt as if I had made butter for the first time in the history of the world. It dawned on me that the mistakes I made provided an experience that gave me insight into the science behind food processes (not to mention buttermilk for making pancakes and sweetened butter for spreading on toast later).Though my sweet tooth was not satisfied that evening, it\\'s experiences like these that have altered my mindset to embrace my mishaps. Extending into the classroom, my answer for my chemistry teacher\\'s question regarding how many elements exist, to which I blurted \\'an infinite!\\', incited some polite chuckles. Although 118 was the accepted answer, I remained hopeful. Reminded by how my biology teacher would always say that hypotheses could never be proven, only disproven, I was determined to find broader answers\\\\u2014ones that could challenge what I read in textbooks. To my surprise, my research brought me to the limitations caused by the stability of nuclei to theories inclusive of the vast universe, and I began to see the nuances of modern science. If even the Miller-Urey experiment could be discredited after being regarded for decades as the single theory of abiogenesis, there could definitely be more than 118 elements that exist: the validity of our claims is dependent on how we can support our hypotheses with evidence.Mistakes can be perceived as embarrassing or silly, but just like being given the potential to extract rich butter from heavy cream, they have become an aspect of my life that I cherish for the opportunity to investigate beyond the surface level. The typical cliche\\\\u0301 of \\'learn from your mistakes\\' has become more than simply avoiding those same mistakes in the future: inside every misstep is now seen as a chance to explore and build upon that experience.Whether it\\'s churning butter by ruining heavy cream, creating a background out of a paint smudge on the side of my painting in my artistic aspirations, or transitioning into an emotional dance improvisation after falling out of a pirouette during a dance showcase, my ability to reshape my adversities has become core to my identity.Moving forward, I will continue mixing and creating, whisking across the stage, stirring into my interest in biological research with an open mind. With one part optimism and one part curiosity, my new recipe for approaching mistakes has become the cream of the crop in my life.As the youngest in my dance family for most of high school, I had countless older siblings who inspired me with their use of dance for fun, catharsis, and communicating ideas. When I explored the passions of my older sisters in their dances, I was motivated to choreograph, teach, rehearse, and perform my own Passion pieces, battling Squirtle as Bulbasaur in Pok\\\\u00e9mon fights and fighting racial oppression by connecting Maya Angelou\\'s spoken word with our movements that gradually joined in unity. The trust between us grew through collaboration while we caught and lifted those that leaped into our arms. Laughter spread contagiously among our slip-ups, and explosive cheers erupted from our backstage chants before each performance. However, when 90% of our dancers left last year after graduating, my familiar group suddenly disappeared, leaving me holding the torch singlehandedly as the oldest dancer left. I was terrified for my dance community, yet a quiet crowd of new dancers emerged. Tackling my responsibilities head on, I helped strengthen the technical skills of my teammates leading APAC dance team rehearsals, running through and improving the main dance routine as well as hosting conditioning sessions including flexibility training and core workouts. I also started hosting Dance Society workshops for our entire high school, fostering the love of dance and expanding the community. Aspiring to rekindle the love and spirit that brought our previous team together, I planned out activities outside of dance with our dance team. Beginning in team dinners, we transitioned into sleepovers and are currently raving over Secret Santa even with APAC already over and Christmas still a month away. Our combined cheer when someone spins a quadruple pirouette, our simultaneous scream after watching our APAC video for the first time, and our combined passion on stage brings me so much joy in knowing that each of us brought our own passionate energy to add to our routine. Our final performance was not only technically outstanding\\\\u2014we danced in synchronization, bonding as one. As the older sister, I stand proudly as our unified spirit filled the air once again.A few years ago, amidst an afternoon where I wasn\\'t feeling my best self, I took a walk in my neighborhood to reflect upon my stresses. Suddenly, a small caramel pug raced across my path, and I braced myself for an impending attack. The puppy, full tongue out, tail wagging, started licking my shin and jumping up on me. My cheeks warmed and a smile spread across my face. Sometimes, it\\'s small moments like these that become genuinely memorable. In awe of the pug\\'s infectious happiness, I asked my best friend whether animals could sense others\\' emotions, and he shared a story of a cat who tried to cheer up its owner by eating all its food upon seeing how happy it made the owner. Grateful for the pug that cheered me up, I began to see the life reflected inside animals. I started creating artwork raising awareness of underrepresented forms of animal cruelty, sharing my ideas by exhibiting my pieces around school.In one of my creations, I tackle the reason we are unable to truly comprehend the cruelty in animal slaughter: the meat we consume is unrecognizable from it\\'s animal form, making meat consumption a casual cruelty. Using a narrative style, I painted a pork bun filled with a live pig glaring at the viewer, impelling them to come to terms with their actions, before the pig is eaten by a human overshadowing the bun. Taking the idiom \\'when pigs fly\\', two other pigs that absurdly fly away from consumption are characterized as a teaser of how their freedom from humans still remains a fantasy. Further, I have explored the impact of plastic pollution on a dissected fish, the effect of pesticides on colony collapse disorder in bees, and the comparative anatomy of humans and animals to strengthen the foundation of my arguments in showing the animal inside humans and more in separate creations. Through abstract imagery, my audience is pushed to analyze each concept. What\\'s most rewarding is when people tell me how my artwork resonates with them and makes them rethink how we should treat animals. As I finally biked downslope with the wind tossing back my hair, a feeling of thrilling gratification overcame me. It was only that morning during sophomore year that I had struggled to even start pedaling, immediately losing balance every time I climbed onto the bike seat. As this was during a school trip, my classmates had already biked out of sight while I was stuck going up the first hill with the teachers in a truck staying right behind me. Though the teachers offered me seat on the truck to excuse me of my struggles, I was determined to relearn the skill of biking that I had left off nine years ago, living in a city where everything was a thirty minute car ride away. Tottering left to right, each foot switching between the pedal and the ground to maintain balance, I started rockily up the incline. On what seemed like the hundredth push, my balance steadied and I trudged forward solidly. At last, the teacher truck could move forward at a constant speed.My ability to persevere through challenges has allowed me to improve inside the classroom as well. At the start of junior year, the biggest academic challenge I faced were writing rhetorical analysis essays in AP English Language and Composition, specifically with pinpointing the author\\'s purpose and communicating the effect of specific rhetorical devices. Informed of my weaknesses, I took the initiative to schedule meetings with my teacher during breaks and lunches to reflect on previous tests and improve my skills. Through these meetings, she gave me practice on analyzing and writing about sample excerpts and helped me foster the habit of asking \\'why\\' in gaining a deeper understanding of each excerpt. At home, I read student essays from previous rhetorical analysis tests, recognizing their strengths and weaknesses to apply what I learned. Paralleling my biking experience, my performance in rhetorical analysis gradually improved through my grit and dedication. As I pedaled faster, I proceeded up the hill with confidence.My response for my chemistry teacher\\'s question regarding how many elements exist, to which I blurted \\'an infinite!\\', incited some polite chuckles. When 118 was concluded as the acceptable answer, I felt my cheeks turn pink at my unexpected lack of prudence. However, reminded of my mother\\'s radiant and contagious admiration of Marie Curie, the revolutionary female scientist who discovered Radium and Polonium, I remained hopeful in my original answer. As my biology teacher would always say that hypotheses could never be proven, only disproven, I was determined to find innovative answers\\\\u2014ones that could challenge what I read in textbooks. To my surprise, my discussions and research brought me to the limitations caused by the stability of nuclei to theories inclusive of the vast universe, and I began to see the nuances of modern science. If even the Miller-Urey experiment could be discredited after being regarded for decades as the single theory of abiogenesis, there could definitely be more than 118 elements that exist: the validity of our claims is dependent on how we can support our hypotheses with evidence.Although these types of experiences can initially be perceived as embarrassing or silly, I\\'ve learned to embrace my unique slip-ups as they provide different perspectives and new possibilities. Whether it\\'s creating a background out of a paint smudge on the side of my painting in my artistic aspirations or transitioning into an emotional dance improvisation after falling out of a pirouette during a dance showcase, my ability to adapt to adversities has become core to my identity. Just as I took on the opportunity to extract knowledge from my own unconventional answer, I will continue to question and be curious, even for concrete and factual topics such as science. Moving forward, I will continue creating art, leaping across the stage, and engaging into my interest in biological research with an open mind. With one part optimism and one part curiosity, my formula for approaching mistakes has been improved. Perhaps I will use this formula to become the new Marie Curie one day.\"}, {\"index\": 92, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'7:38\\' blazes in hazy green lines from the grease-smeared oven clock. It\\'s time. The oven is off-limits, but the microwave\\'s all mine. My heart thumps hard against my chest as I press my face into its door, an eager eight-year-old with the urgent need to get in on the action.Inside, whatever concoction has sprung into my mind\\\\u2014too-thick potato slices attempting to fry in a bowl of Canola oil, chocolate chips melting for ganache, the doughy batter of a soon-to-be three-tier cake, you name it\\\\u2014 glow under the orange haze, obscured by a rising cloud of steam.When Mama emerges from saying goodnight to my sister, I hope that my gummy, underbaked, off-tasting creation will be at the forefront of her mind, rather than the sink full of dishes and flour-coated counter. The couch trembles with the impatient bouncing of my leg as I wait for her, so that she can see my masterpiece in all of its glory.In third grade, I blasted my carefully-packed tortellini in the school cafeteria microwave for a full seven minutes. Its softness fled, its remains blistering my taste buds as I dared to take a bite. I thought I knew the ways of the microwave; I convinced myself that I could do it alone. Failure at such a simple task crushed me. If I couldn\\'t properly use a microwave, could I do anything at all? But these were just the thoughts of my eight-year-old brain. Only a few years later, not only had I mastered the microwave, but I had finally unlocked the realm of true freedom: the kitchen.As I grew older, the kitchen became my domain. I started to make dinner, at first a giddy twelve-year-old spending hours to mix, shape, and boil fresh pasta, still leaning on my trusted microwave to warm jarred marinara. By my sixteenth birthday, the wafting smell of fresh pita would fill the house on a Tuesday night as a pot of boiling chickpeas set to become hummus babbled quietly to itself in the background.I left the microwave to grow cold in its lonely corner, despite occasionally turning to it to melt butter or steam mochi. My mind swirled with limitless possibility: passion fruit vinegar splashed on pomegranate seeds, spring parsnips topped with toasted hazelnuts, bitter dark chocolate swirled with tahini.As my access to the kitchen expanded, even if only a few square feet more, a new world opened up. At a spice store in New York, the absence of Aleppo peppers led to a conversation with the owner about the conflict in Syria. I feed my sourdough starter, which I\\'ve named Marija, and wonder about the way we tame cultures and form our own, and about how most of bread\\'s bubbles are really just one, connected through narrow, winding openings.\\'This one tastes kind of like charcoal,\\' I say to my mother as she dubiously eyes the black lava salt I sprinkle over a batch of cookies. \\'Here, try it.\\'She questions why there are six different types of salt scattered across the counter, why cookies should even be topped with them in the first place, and I smile.Now that I can use the big knives, roast whole cauliflowers at 500\\\\u00ba, reach the high cabinets without standing on a stool on tippy-toes, I have no reason to await the wonders I once found in the microwave.The air fills with the intoxicating scent of sugar caramelizing, nectarine slices gently melting into the surface of the rich, custardy batter.

I realized that my job in that moment was not to just understand this subject, but to understand it so well that I could deconstruct it into fundamental concepts and explain it to someone who didn\\'t. I was teaching her the language of mathematics. And it wasn\\'t enough to know it; In order to teach it, I had to master it.18 months ago, I started working as an instructor at Mathnasium Learning Center in Castle Rock. What started as a way for me to make some extra money would quickly become the job that would change my life. This experience was meaningful to me because from it, I realized two things: First, I want to become fluent in the language of mathematics, and second, I definitely want to teach it.In thatmoment, I could tell that my young student wanted to surrender. We had been learning and reviewing graphs for weeks. A concept that I took for granted, she dreaded each lesson. She asked why graphs have negative values and why some values have a zero in them. I realized that the problem was not her ability to understand. The problem was my ability to translate.In order to be effective, I had to recognize that math isn\\'t just numbers and equations, nor is it simply lines, symbols, and facts. Math is pictures. Math is words. Math is motion. Math is shapes and three dimensions. In order to explain graphing to this particular student, I had to go back reconsider explaining it in a way she could understand. How can I translate it so that it makes more sense?I needed a new approach. I reminded myselfthis student is a visual learner. She needs colors and shapes to help her visualize concepts. So I grabbed paper, markers, and colored pencils, and began to draw a picture for my student. I sketched a graph with a farm, and she was in the middle. There were vegetables in the ground, birds and clouds in the sky, and plants on the x-axis. These objects I drew would help her put the meaning of areas of the graph into context. It was a language she understood.I started showing her what the values of the coordinate pairs meant in this situation. I asked her about the coordinate (2,-6). Would it make sense for this point to be a cloud or a potato? What part of the coordinate tells gives you a blue?We continued discussions like these and I could see the change in her attitude towards graphing because of the look in her eyes. She was finally starting to understand. It was such a good feeling for the both of us. By translating this idea into tangible and simple ideas, I was able to help her make that crucial connection.For the following months, my focus in teaching shifted. My number one priority was finding an approach for each and every student that engaged them. This was a challenge, but it was also exciting for me. I taught myself to look at mathematics in abstract ways. I developedways to translate multiplication, fractions, ratios, algebra, and even calculus. Developing new and innovativeways of explaining this language helped my students to be more successful in math.I enjoy working at Mathnasium because I never run out of topics and ideas to teach. I believe that one of the most important parts about mastering the language of mathematics is the ability to explore fundamentals from a new perspective, and to be open to exploring a concept in a variety of ways. This work experience impacted my perception of mathematics, and inspired me to pursue it professionally.Challenge accepted.\"}, {\"index\": 94, \"new_personal_statement\": \"We are the ones we have been waiting for.The day the Mandra floods occurred in Greece, I was sitting in the comfort of my History of Social Sciences class. As the ideas of Plato, Schopenhauer, and Kant filled our morning, our teacher stopped abruptly to inform us of the news. One of my country\\'s poorest communities, one that has been chronically struggling with societal inequalities, was now left with almost nothing. That same afternoon, we assembled a small group and decided to collect donations for the victims.As we went from class to class to encourage students to contribute to our charitable drive, it was clear that my community lacked two things: awareness and activism. Our pathsas Pierce graduates should be inscribed with the vision of \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Non Ministrare, Sed Ministrare\\' \\\\u2013 To serve, not to be served \\\\u2013 the very vision that guided our community in the wake of the Smyrna genocide almost a century ago. Yet barely any understanding of thiscommunal spirit could be conjured in the classrooms we walked into. Growing up in a country defined by the socioeconomic obstacles it faces, I am no stranger to this mindset. Volunteering appears to be a true luxury in the face of many problems.An interest thus sparked within me to develop an initiative that promotes exactly what is missing from the Greek community: active citizenship to address the most pressing problems of our society. Recognizing the disunity that exists between the members of my school community, as it celebrates more than 5,000 members, I decided to take this idea a step further. It came together in the form of the American College of Greece Human Rights Club. The details seemed to flood my head as the pieces of ACGHRC came together- we would dedicate each month to a different human right, promoting activism opportunities, connecting student groups all across the American College of Greece family. The ACGHRC quickly developed from a scratch book idea to the center of my purpose as an ACG student.With my club plan in hand, I quietly approached my school principal\\'s office. He sat and shifted, frowned and exhaled as I explained the idea to him; he asked a myriad questions, about funding, operation hours, our use of the school name. I went on and on, reassuring each and every one of his worries- I could have never given up easily. With a halfhearted smile and hesitating glance, he offered me a place on the school club list, setting forth restrictions like to meet only once a week, all of which I gladly accepted- mere timetable restrictions could never stand in the way of a purpose so greater than ourselves.Weeks went on, and the only thing we seemed to be doing was putting up posters, inviting people, sending out emails, and launching drives. Students approached us hesitantly at first, but by the end of the first month, the result resembled a supernova: out of thinair, hundreds of students had joined us in our efforts, bringing in novel ideas, glowing with a feeling of impact.Support is truly to be found anywhere, as long as one seeks for it. Motivation is omnipresent, and even when hidden under layers of insecurity and uncertainty, it is a powerful and unstoppable driving force. Looking into my future, I envision never stopping, always igniting that spark in my immediate community- even if it requires that extramile. Creating ACGHRC has instilled within me the value of civic engagement, responsible citizenship, and social justice, developing my capacity and appreciation for genuine and impactful teamwork with my peers.As I see my group collecting community contributions and proudly representing our cause, I cannot help but smile and silently recite June Jordan\\'s Poem for South African Women-And what will join this standing up and the oneswho stood without sweet company will sing and sing back into the mountains and if necessary even under the seaWe are the ones we have been waiting for.Harmony. The harmony that dominates our existence has been one of the wonders which have fascinated me from a very young age. Life is characterized by it in each and every aspect; all cells, all tissues, all organs working in an absolute harmony inside each individual, creating the euphony of existence. This is exactly what drew me to science, the way the entirety of the universe seems to be drawn into parallel with all of its aspects. The complexity of it all, whether it was in terms of chemical reactions or electrical circuits, has been decisive for their existence, and has surely been the basis of my passion for engineering. Engineering offers a perfect platform to manipulate this scientific harmony, the very seed of my intellectual curiosity. I am in awe of the possibility of combining my interest in the diverse scientific fields of physics, biology, and mathematics in creating cutting edge healthcare applications. From the moment I first stepped into a biotechnology lab, I was utterly amazed by the possibilities biomedical engineering presents to our world. It is so much more than simply securing better healthcare- it can prospectively allow us to reshape our approach to agriculture, medicine, and everything in between.In my pursuit of understanding the complex phenomena that formulate our world, I participated in the International Summer School for Young Physicists at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, in Canada. My participation allowed me to study modern physics topics and to conduct my own research, focusing on quantum computing as applied to biochemical simulations, and error correction in quantum data. I also worked with University of Waterloo\\'s Institute of Quantum Computing and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNOLAB), experiences which allowed me to take up scientific challenges, hands-on. Working with international researchers has taught me to work as part of a team, approach each difficulty with courage, and apply my commitment to excellence to my scientific pursuits and all areas of my life.My journey in Engineering continued with my participation in F1 in Schools, through which I conducted aerodynamics and hydrodynamic testing research at the aerodynamics lab of the National Technical University of Athens. Specifically, I worked on new models of hydrodynamic testing and the development of systems of correlation for Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD) - lab water tunnel testing. Furthermore, I attended a Genetic Engineering class at the Phillips Exeter Academy Summer School in the US, where I completed bioengineering lab work and closely studied restriction enzyme technology. I also received 2nd Place in the National EU Science Olympiad and was a National Finalist in the World Robot Olympiad. Such experiences have enriched my scientific thinking and understanding of the problems I will be called to solve as an engineer.My dedication to my school community can be reflected in my six years of participation and leadership in Student Council. As an elected member, I advocate ideas of my classmates and organize fundraising projects. Such responsibilities have taught me leadership, selflessness, and dedication. Also, as an avid politics enthusiast, I have participated in over ten Model United Nations conferences. As a chair, I have completed extensive study guides on complex sociopolitical issues, developing this way my analytical thinking and writing skills. I am pursuing a degree in the UK because, as a powerhouse of international development and innovation, it will offer me unparalleled research and industrial experience opportunities. Studying among scholars yielding from every corner of the world will also expand my horizons, academic and social alike.In overall, I believe biomedical engineering to be a field that perfectly combines my interests in multidisciplinary research, entrepreneurship, and analytical problem-solving, and thus I truly cannot see myself being anything but an engineer.\"}, {\"index\": 95, \"new_personal_statement\": \"On Witherspoon, wedged between a pub and a bank is the typical humdrum bakery-cafe. Brick walls against black canopy. Aged window panes.

Rich waves hi from the counter, and I wave back as I slide into my regular seat by the window. My finger instantly goes to the crook on the underside of the table\\\\u2014a tiny constant that\\'s oddly comforting. The faint whirring of the cappuccino machine underlays the delicate clinks of plates in the sink, the murmurs of coffeehouse chatter, enveloping everything in a rhythmic lull.An old lady wrapped in a poncho glances up from her soup as a couple passes by, tripping over their Spanish syllables. The clean-cut man in a business suit taps his foot in line despite it being Sunday afternoon. At the table across, a toddler the color of cookies and cream jumps up and down, begging his preoccupied mother to try a sip of coffee. When she shushes him, saying it doesn\\'t even taste good, he retorts by asking why she drinks it everyday. My lips tug slightly upwards.A space-dyed sweater fills my field of vision, and I refocus to my friend as she pulls out the chair across from me. \\'Hey, sorry for being late...\\' I wave it off, telling her not to worry, and instantly feel the dimple forming, that \\'small pocket\\' in my left cheek that she teases me so often about. Shaking off her layers, a reserved grin suggesting the same anticipation for one of our sessions appears. \\'Guess what happened to my hair. Oh! Wait, wait how did the presentation go?\\'Suddenly, we\\'re talking about my embarrassing mispronouncing of Socrates as So-crates (blame Bill & Ted), and concocting a plan (only half-jokingly) to break the world record for largest pom-pom. We\\'re talking about her hair turning orange as Garfield a few hours after the salon, and how funny it would\\'ve been if her mom hadn\\'t gotten upset. We\\'re talking about everything from middle school art projects, to Whole Earth aisles working better than her mom\\'s therapy, and the way light showers a certain corner of our school if it snows just right.There\\'s the breathless staccatos of laughter, the hushed, introspective exchanges, interwoven with the whole- noted pauses that only radiate warmth. And slowly, in between the sips of hot cider and headlights traversing across glass, the space transforms.As I look around and listen to the stories that permeate the cafe, my perspective shifts. The layers and dimensions that make up the weary voice calling customer names, the strands still tinted orange under dim lights start to become apparent, and beautiful...A sense of awe for the vastness captured in this tiny microcosm settles over me. Yet there\\'s a fragility shaped by the same seen and unseen forces simultaneously interconnecting us all.

Stumbling through the street trying to politely contain our laughter, we nearly run into that cheesy sign with that chalk-drawn smiley by the door. I almost tilt my head to briefly smile back. The restaurant lights splaying onto the sidewalks, the cool breeze grazing against my cheeks, these\\\\u2014are the infinite, intangible moments I carry with me wherever I go.\"}, {\"index\": 96, \"new_personal_statement\": \"There are many things I appreciate about my Korean culture. Whether it be the delicious food or wearing my hanbok on New Year\\'s Day, I\\'ve always loved celebrating the rich heritage that I represent. But, like every culture, Korean has its disadvantages. Never wise enough, experienced enough, or mature enough, my youth has never been a desirable state in traditional Korean culture but rather a restrictive limitation\\\\u2014an obstacle. In my house, I was simply \\'too young to know anything,\\' and, as I came to believe the claims of my culture, I dutifully accepted a life of obedience and silence. My acceptance of a silent life met a barrier that forced me to reconsider my beliefs when I visited a childhood friend, Erica. Erica and I separated because the location of our houses dictated that we should attend different high schools. As I walked around her campus for the first time, absorbing and catching every detail around me, I felt confused. How could a school just one town over appear so different from my own? Instead of basketball courts, there were lines hand-drawn with chalk. Instead of a library, there were only a few shelves of worn-out books. Confronted with the startling discrepancies between my privilege and her unfair disadvantage, I was utterly shocked. I wished I could do something greater and more meaningful to help the school, but at that moment, I felt powerless. All I could do was give Erica a hug and say \\'I\\'m sorry\\'\\\\u2014for I was still a student, and more importantly, a Korean student who was still \\'too young to have a voice.\\' But I was wrong. In the following weeks, I felt the beginnings of change stir deep within me; the awakening of a voice that had been silent for years. I gathered people to volunteer with me at lower socioeconomic schools; thinking that if they couldn\\'t have extracurricular activities because of monetary restraints, I could be the one to change that. Together with my volunteers, I organized school activities such as basketball tournaments and various science labs for the students. And while I found some excitement in having successfully implemented extracurricular programs, true success came from watching the students, one by one, find their passion.I was inspired by each student\\'s individual achievement, and began working even harder, hoping to ensure that more needs were met. So when one of the boys, Daniel, came to me with an interest in coding, I pushed myself to understand. Despite having no knowledge of the subject whatsoever, I helped him set up a Java program on his outdated but still-working computer. Together, we learned and taught each other basic codes, working hard every day until, finally, he was able to code a game. As I gave him a hug, and said, \\'We did it!,\\' I was reminded of that day when I sat with Erica, feeling vulnerable and powerless; a feeling that seemed so distant now. With newfound might, I looked at Daniel and saw a growth that ultimately represented a sense of growth in me as well. I could no longer be silenced.I eventually took these matters to bigger heights and began attending conferences to speak about the problems that exist within our education system. I talked to California legislators and state officials, and created proposals promoting bills\\\\u2014all in an attempt to narrow the equality issues that exist in California, and to bring more attention to schools, such as my friend\\'s, that are too often overlooked. Administrators were shocked, like I was, when they found out about what students were going through in these unfamiliar areas. But what was most shocking to me was the undivided attention adults gave to a student\\'s voice. While I do come from a culture that idolizes \\'respectful silence,\\' I now realize that there are some things we can only change if we use our voice. What is it about the California weather that everyone seems to love?It is comfortably warm, blindingly shiny, and there is never a season. Growing up in Los Angeles, this weather pattern was normal. As I entered my first year at University of Southern California, everyday, I woke up to the rays of sunshine caressing my body and the warm breeze fondling against my face. Everyone loved the weather and constantly talked about how nice it was. Though I loved to read outside on my picnic blanket and enjoyed a round of skateboarding from time to time, I began to realize I was not content. I didn\\'t like being comfortable. Growing up in Los Angeles, I have adapted many of its cultural elements. My current university also carries some of these elements being that it is located in Los Angeles. However, due to this, I feel that the people I meet and interact with generally have similar views on life and the world. Even speaking with many international students and non-natives of Los Angeles, I did not feel a struggle to have to adapt my cultural behaviors in order to converse with them. If anything, they wanted to fit in to my culture -- the \\'LA\\' culture. They would tell me about the difficulties in trying to adapt to a setting much different than their homeland. And I craved that experience. I wanted to be culturally challenged and learn to adapt to people much different than me. And despite the differences, I wanted to have a genuine, intellectual conversation about life and the world. During my first semester, I took a course on Eco-Theatre. I found this class particularly interesting because it was something I had never thought about. There were so many creative ways in raising awareness for a certain topic; and, many writers had incorporated their passions for saving the environment and wrote plays about them. I was intrigued. I wanted to talk about it. But the 12 people that were in my class were enrolled solely to fulfill their requirements. I joined eco-friendly clubs on campus and participated in local volunteer events at Venice Beach, but the in-depth level of conversation was never fulfilled. Even this semester, after my Gender and Social Justice class, I am so inspired by all the points discussed in the class. How do we appeal to the systems of power for female needs without appearing vulnerable or carrying the stereotypes of being \\'female\\'? Or is it better to utilize those stereotypes of being \\'female\\' and appeal to that particular trait? How do we establish a system in which helps people dying in prisons now but also looks at complete abolishment of prisons in the future? As I am going back home for the weekend, I ramble on about what I have learned to my mother. She is interested in listening to what I have to say but she just nods. As do the friends I have made in college. It is nice to know there are people who want to listen to me, but I want something more. I want to be challenged. I want my ideas to feel threatened. I want to feel uncomfortable in such discussions. Because through that, I grow. I develop stronger opinions but also open space for more ideas. Yes, I am weird. I ask \\'random\\' questions. I like being uncomfortable. I like having a missing piece in my puzzle that I have to struggle to find. My drive for something more has been a part of me throughout my college experience. There is a bigger world out there than just Los Angeles. There are rainy days, snowy days, and humid days. Growing up in the shining sun was good, but now it is too comfortable and I want a change. \"}, {\"index\": 97, \"new_personal_statement\": \"My legs dangled precariously over the step\\'s edge. I longingly watched as everyone else weaved around the playground, shrieking and giggling. Leaving the comfortable environment of my home where every conversation was in Vietnamese, I entered preschool with just the two English words my mom taught me that morning: hello and bathroom. Overcome by a lack of familiarity, I felt tears rolling down my face. At home, I was a naturally talkative toddler, but here the echoes of foreign sounds enveloped me. I was overwhelmed and silent.Looking up with tear-stained cheeks, I saw Mrs. Diana. She took me into her arms, wiping away my tears. From her, I learned words, phrases, and more importantly, patience and kindness. As I found my English voice, I adapted to preschool and was once again the talkative toddler I was at home. Her guidance inspired me in a way I could not have anticipated; it shaped me to seek inclusivity and create harmony around me.All throughout elementary and middle school, I was enrolled in every after school program. Very much like those first days at preschool, I found myself constantly in new environments. However, this time my past experiences allowed me to thrive. I enthusiastically lived the idiom, \\'the more the merrier,\\'\\\\u2014insisting on organizing unimaginably large matches of handball and adding colored pencils to games of Spoons so that anyone who wanted to play could. I always invited over any kids sitting alone to join. Since then, I strive to give back to and create a community I had so much fun growing up in.For twelve years, I carved out my place in the Los Alamitos community. I realized that behind the camps, carnivals, and parades that defined my childhood were committed high schoolers and adults who shared my love for the community. As a high schooler, I went from tossing the bean bag to handing out the prize, from getting my face painted to painting faces, and from watching the parade to tossing candy to the packed sides of Main Street.Along with continuing many community traditions, I created some of my own. Sophomore year, I helped to launch elementary school science nights throughout the district. Today, I research experiments for hours and meticulously balance the budget, scouring Amazon for deals, because I love guiding kids through the baking soda vinegar balloon and hearing their screams when it suddenly inflates. I get excited seeing them eagerly inch closer to the magic show stage before the elephant toothpaste explodes. As each night comes to an end, the volunteers and I are laughing at each others\\' food coloring stained hands while painstakingly cleaning cornstarch off carpets with wet wipes. Together, we have taken our local science nights and, this year, shared it with an underprivileged district nearby, extending our community to those around us.With the larger events, I keep \\'the more the merrier\\' in mind walking down the hallways and sitting in my classes everyday. Risking the occasional weird looks, I approach random students in the hallways to say, \\'Hey! I\\'m taking pictures for yearbook. Can I get one of you guys?\\' It is worth it to see their faces light up and to capture genuine moments of the entire student body. Other times, I simply open up my circle to the girl I see alone on her phone, so she can join our lively debate over the best pen.Simply put, I love my community, the people, and the memories we create together. From that first day in preschool to this exact moment now, I am actively involved in shaping a community that welcomes everyone, has fun together, and ultimately fosters an extended family. My community is not just defined by the city lines of Los Alamitos, instead it is this vibrant spirit I will continue to bring with me and strive to create wherever life takes me.\\'Cuantos anos tienes?\\' After four years of Spanish, I found myself using it in a context other than singing along to a song on the radio. I, with about 45 other Los Alamitos high schoolers, had taken over Bryant Elementary School for the night, bringing with us a Halloween \\'magic\\' show and interactive science experiments. Two years ago, I helped launch district wide elementary school science nights. Today, I spend hours researching experiments and meticulously balancing the budget, scouring Amazon for deals, because I love hearing kids scream when the baking soda vinegar balloon I guide them through inflates. I get excited for the kids as they eagerly inch closer to the magic show stage before the elephant toothpaste explodes. It has been rewarding to see this project grow each year and create such memorable nights for the community.To start this school year, we decided to bring our science night to an underprivileged elementary school outside of the district. Bryant is attended by many students where English is not spoken at home. The majority of students come from Hispanic or Vietnamese households. Working at the registration table, I guided each student through the process, switching to the different languages to better communicate. Throughout the night, I traveled from room to room, making sure the event leaders had everything they needed and that the experiments were running smoothly--helping to explain experiments that seemed unclear and even creating an impromptu lava lamp experiment using the leftover materials for a K/1 room. While as a high school, we may not be in the same district or community as Bryant, we achieved our goal that night seeing the kids run to their parents, proudly showing off their experiments. We currently have several science nights lined up this year and will now also keep in mind the elementary schools in the neighboring areas who may also appreciate an experience like this. My community is not just defined by Los Alamitos, instead it is this vibrant spirit I bring and will continue to bring with me and strive to create wherever life takes me.For the past two summers, I have spent long hot sweaty summers on campus preparing for orientation because I enjoy welcoming freshmen to the new community, sharing advice, and starting off their high school experience positively. During the intensive training camps, we learn activities and methods to open up the freshmen and create group costumes for the annual contest. On the day of orientation, my partner and I walked in, super excited to meet our freshmen. The twenty of us sat in a circle and started introducing ourselves. With each game and activity, the group opened up more and more, and by the end, everyone felt relaxed. We no longer felt like strangers as we joked around and shared stories; the three hours of activities went by quickly. In each group of incoming freshmen, there are always a couple shy ones in the group. I always make sure to partner up with them because I know how scary it was entering high school. Leading the group around the campus, we point out where all their classrooms were, the snack carts with the fastest lines, and the cleanest bathroom. From an awkward, uncomfortable twenty strangers, we become a group of colorful Hydro Flasks parading through the halls for the costume contest that goes along with orientation. When we pulled out the costumes, they knew instantly from the bottle cap hats. They were pumped to put on the costumes and it was a great way to introduce them to the fun school spirit that is always present at our school. Being a part of Link Crew for the past two years, I have met many amazing freshmen and have helped make the transition into high school a smoother one. The shared memories created between the freshmen that day are something they can take with them as they walk in on the first day of school. I love seeing my freshmen again and catching up with them in the hallways throughout the years. I look forward to being a campus ambassador in college and continuing to welcome incoming students into the community.Sophomore year, I decided to take AP Physics because I was driven to learn something completely new. The class was so different from the others that I have taken since it was much lab based and self-driven. Because I went into this class with no prior physics experience, I did not understand a lot of the concepts initially. I remember being so confused coming to class each day, not fully understanding the concepts when the teacher talked about them. There were some days I felt that maybe I was in over my head--that I should just drop the class for something easier. I persisted and tried even harder in the class to grasp the material. Though I was not always successful, the material became easier and fascinated me with the high level of applicability that it had. I was excited to come into class each day because I soon found the material very interesting. It is not a class I regret taking. I have always enjoyed math, but as I progressed over the years, it was losing its practical applicability. AP Physics taught me how to apply it in a way where I could anticipate events and control actions. I will never forget my lab group and I nervously watching our ball roll off the table and screaming with joy when it landed in the cup on the ground during a mechanical energy lab where we had to anticipate the ball\\'s trajectory using just paper and a pencil. I saw how valuable math could be and how physics was the medium through which I could apply it to solve real life problems.Though the class was challenging (I may have shed a tear or two), it was a class I encourage everyone who asks me to take because it pushed me to be a better problem solver and a more independent thinker. The skills I learned ultimately helped me succeed in many of my other classes. I was first introduced to history reading the Little House on the Prairie series in second grade. Wagons, calico dresses, and log cabins filled my imagination. The image of Laura and her sister squeezing molasses candy on pans of snow to the time Pa tries Almanzo\\'s warm, fluffy pancakes soaked in syrup on a wintery afternoon are forever imprinted into my mind. The vivid descriptions of food were not the only things I took away from the series. I experienced daily life on the west--the struggles of raising crops, the poverty with being so far away from the hub of the country, and that, despite all the obstacles, the normalcy of life back then like going to school on weekdays and enjoying town fairs. At home, I began scrolling through Wikipedia pages titled Laura Ingalls Wilder, Almanzo Wilder, and American Pioneer. The honest narrative of life on the frontier captivated me. As a young girl, I connected and grew up with her as she chased the west. Taking AP U.S. History, I learned the about the inherent bias in the storytelling quality of history, allowing us to form our own educated opinions, debating the morals and perspectives of past events. An academic approach to history allowed me to see the structures of history and patterns of events throughout time.On most Saturday nights, I turn on the Smithsonian Channel to watch a documentary or scroll through Netflix to find a new docu-series. Through documentaries, the words in my textbook come to life and spark my curiosity about events not taught in class. From history, I can learn how people have lived, the problems they have faced, and the ways they have tried to solve them. I learn about the origins of many present day ideologies and the events that have shaped the world to its current point today. History, for me, inspires change, that beliefs are not set in stone. Though I do not plan to study history, I know I will continue to indulge the history nerd within me. \"}, {\"index\": 98, \"new_personal_statement\": \"A row of worn-down cement shacks populated one side, and straw houses sparsely filled the other with green rice paddies. I was playing games on my dad\\'s new iPhone 4. I didn\\'t want to get out of the van, but I had no choice. Before my uncle even stopped the engine, all my father\\'s relatives flooded around the car welcoming our arrival, knee-deep in mud, even those I had never seen before.My relatives saw this visit as a chance for me to understand my ancestral roots, lifestyle, and traditions that have been ongoing for generations. Although I knew they lived just a few hours from China\\'s economic capital, Shanghai, I was immediately dumbstruck that they lacked the basic necessities of running water and electricity. Where water streamed from my faucets, they pumped it out of wells; where my house was lighted by electricity, gas lamps were the norm for them. In the midst of reflecting upon how hard their lives were, my uncles were gathering piles of cow dung to fuel the cooking fire. I felt as if I should do something to help them with the laborious effort put into dinner, only to be interrupted by the hospitality of my other relatives.After catching up with them, it was time to visit one of my dad\\'s uncles, who lived a few kilometers off on the other side of the dirt road. As we drove, the road narrowed, and our van slowed to walking speed. Bits of the road began crumbling into the dugout rice paddies from the wheels. A twenty minute journey seemed to take hours and when we arrived, my father\\'s uncle came out of his doorless straw hut. It was the first time I\\'d met him. He seemed to be in his seventies, walking with a cane, waving and smiling slowly at all of us. But the first thing my dad said out of the car was wishing him a healthy one-hundredth birthday. I was speechless. He then showed us the inside of his life-long, hand-built straw house , the rice paddy he worked in and the animals he raised. We invited him back to Grandpa\\'s house for dinner. Despite the festivities and exotic food served, I couldn\\'t eat as my mind was thinking about the everyday difficulties they face that I take for granted, yet it seemed they were all much more content with their lives than I was. The rain finally cleared, and the sun began to set as we gave our farewells. Staring at the back of the car, the village faded away. I told my dad, \\'When I have money, I want to modernize this town.\\' But he responded indifferently, comforting me, \\'Don\\'t. I miss some of the old values I had when I was young. Keeping things the way they have been is what keeps them happy.\\' The village silhouette disappeared below the horizon. It was the first time I met many of them, and for some, the last time. Returning home, I quickly began to see how the lessons learned from my father\\'s village could be applied to my home in Silicon Valley. While social media and technology have improved our abilities to network and connect with others, they have only further alienated those who need support in our society, threatening their sense of belonging. This inspired me to join the Youth Advisory Committee and Mayor\\'s Council of my hometown where I can make the greatest local impact on those who need it. In these organizations, our main goal was to better unify the community through public events and outreach programs to vulnerable groups. From these experiences, happiness took on a new meaning for me: it no longer resonated from the luxuries in life, but from appreciating and supporting the solace and sense of belonging every individual finds in their journey. When I entered high school, all freshmen were mandated to partake in a daily twenty-minute seminar called the Freshman Mentor Program (FMP), where upperclassmen led us in social and academic activities to smoothen the transition from middle school. This was one of the most enriching experiences of my freshman year, as my mentors shaped my academic endeavors. Seeing how much FMP had shaped me, I wanted to do the same for others.On the first day of junior year, I, along with four others, were ready to advise thirty new similar yet diverse freshman. It was my goal to get to know each individual on a one-to-one basis and to help them with whatever they needed. Despite my initial ambivalence of the challenge I would be undertaking, I soon found myself able to connect with most students within these twenty minutes through brief but meaningful conversations. My favorite memory as a mentor was changing a student who actively participated in FMP yet was very timid and shy outside the classroom. If I didn\\'t notice him eating lunch by himself one day, I would never have had discovered his reserved side.After one week, I decided to check in with him. To my surprise, he said he felt insecure from those who once bullied him in his grade and upperclassmen who seemed intimidating. I worked closely with him, introducing him to my friends and student leaders around campus. Step by step, he began to find a sense of belonging at school by proactively taking on leadership through student-run organizations. What felt most heartwarming at the end of the year was that he also wanted to become a mentor to help those in similar predicaments as him. As a second year mentor, it has been a rewarding journey to see the freshmen I\\'ve mentored develop in their sophomore year. They have all grown so much from their freshmen selves into mature and confident leaders around campus. Now, I have a new cycle of freshmen, and from last year\\'s experience, I hope to utilize it to further enhance the freshman experience. Capturing the glimmering stars under the Mars-like American southwest or San Francisco\\'s skyline silhouette, landscape photography has allowed me to see the eloquence in nature. Mindfully capturing nature\\'s bounties, mountains and rivers come to life dancing in their raw forms. Even everyday experiences become wonders as they highlight the small things we often take for granted or overlook. But what I love the most about landscape photography is the artistic memorabilia they create for me; hanging around my bedroom walls, I often revisit the experiences of those expeditions.Growing up in a STEM-oriented environment, opportunities to express my creativity were rare. I always thought that everything was either right or wrong. But once I picked up my father\\'s camera, everything changed. The potential of my creativity finally began to unleash.What made me first pick up photography was when I discovered how mechanized this creative process could be. All photography involved was selecting a scene, setting the camera\\'s shutter speed and aperture parameters, and then pressing the shutter button. Yet, only one combination of these parameters yields the best photo. This made me think about the parallel between photography to science: we\\'re given the basic principles and laws of the natural world, but we must figure out that one method of piecing everything together that allows them to function most cohesively as one collective body.Capturing and appreciating landscape photography has given me a new perspective in problem solving and creativity. From rearranging my bedroom so that it\\'s more aesthetically pleasing to evaluating problems more holistically, this hobby has focused my attention to the little but significant details I once overlooked. These details are what sometimes determines the difference between success and failure, especially in programming when a small error such as missing a semicolon can cause your entire program to crash. But what\\'s most important to me was the realization I had that science didn\\'t always have a binary answer. Just like photography, it was finding that perfect combination that mattered. After having taken Principles of Engineering, a Project Lead the Way engineering and computer science course at my high school in sophomore year, I became captivated by the fields of electrical engineering and computer science. Seeing the following summer as an opportunity to enrich my understanding of these fields, I participated in Carnegie Mellon\\'s Pre-College Program, where I took two intensive courses: Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and Principles of Computing. Introduction to ECE offered me a hands-on experience of what being an electrical engineer is like. From understanding the theory behind electronic components to circuit analysis to prototyping, it was humbling to finally begin to piece together the tremendous efforts needed to build the computers that exist today. By the end of the course, building circuits became a new hobby for me. It\\'s just like playing with Legos, except with batteries, integrated circuits, and other components: anything is possible, it just depends on how you arrange the pieces together.Principles of Computing gave me a novel perspective on computer science. A field that I once thought was only about creating programs quickly turned into mathematical reasoning as we delved into proving algorithms and using mathematical techniques to model physical systems. Despite the course\\'s steep learning curve, its challenges only welcomed my interests in computer science. Fascinated by how mathematics drove all processes in computers, I became fascinated by how it is applied in subjects such as machine learning and data mining.Upon leaving Carnegie Mellon, my interests became well-defined in these two fields. With more questions about them than I came in with, my desires for further exploration only became stronger. Thanks to the concrete foundations I developed, not only was it easier for me to learn new concepts by myself, but to also read and understand research in these fields. From modeling biological cells with electronic components to conducting research in machine learning, the fundamentals I have learned from these courses have inspired me to pursue a degree in computer science to one day push the frontiers of tomorrow\\'s computing. \\'It\\'s lit! The microprocessor\\'s light is blinking! But why? Microprocessors are pieces of metal and clearly can\\'t understand English!\\'. Though a minor comical celebration, this sparked my curiosity in computer science. I soon became entangled with code to understand why these chips worked the way they did, and how we tricked semiconductors into machines. My interests quickly ravaged from hardware components to applets to machine learning, where I became faced with a new challenge: understanding the mathematical implications behind neural networks. My interests in computer science were well-defined in the summer of 2017 where I conducted research at UCSB through the Research Mentorship Program. I looked into modifying neural network architectures used in artificial intelligence to optimize image denoising. Throughout this research period, my passion for this field only intensified, and from the foundations this project gave me in machine learning, I took on the challenge of conducting independent research, where I looked at improving early lung cancer diagnosis using medical imaging and artificial intelligence. I was humbled that my work was validated by scientists in this field, as it was recognized by the Siemens Competition as a semifinalist project. At school, I look at how I can integrate computer science into my STEM courses such as modeling biochemical systems. But what I love most about computer science is how it can drastically reduce the time needed to complete a repetitive task. For example, as an officer of California Scholarship Federation, a large merit-based service organization at my school, one of my duties include reviewing applications. Using techniques such as handwriting recognition and sorting algorithms have allowed me to completely automate the review process in a fraction of the amount of time it would have taken me if I had done so manually. At home, using spare electronic components, I have created a fully autonomous lighting system based on the time of day and ambient brightness. For me, computer science not only is a tool to automate tasks from day to day life, but also serves as a robust utility for unveiling and understanding phenomena of the natural world. \"}, {\"index\": 99, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Growing up, my tongue was my worst enemy. To make normal sounds meant contorting it into seemingly foreign shapes, the effort of which often made my tongue weary. My R\\'s become W\\'s, my S\\'s slurred; when I became excited and spoke fast, I might as well have been speaking in another language. I loathed the incomprehensible sounds that came out of my mouth, but, looking back, it was not the words that flowed through my lips that I detested, but the ones that never had the chance to come out.Freshman year was around the time I realized the impact of these missing words from my childhood, and, coincidentally, the time I began delving into languages, particularly Korean. At the time, I was unaware that this endeavor would uncover a voice within myself whose existence I had been ignorant of for years.As I learned to introduce myself using Korean, starting from \\'hello\\', I was introduced to my father through the return address of a letter. In one quick Google search, I realized that the father I grew up knowing - the Private Investigator who would disappear for months for work - was a complete stranger. My real father had a return address from the Ohio Correctional Facility, where he had been for the last two years on a felony drug charge. Questions I had always held inside me, questions I was too afraid to even consider, rose to my lips, but by then my tongue had grown weary from the weight of these unspoken words.Instead, I learned how to ask these questions in a second language. Why did you leave? Where did you go? I could express these in Korean, but it was not until the Google search that I discovered the answers. Along with this discovery, the fragments of prior events \\\\u2014 fragments I had never tried to make sense of\\\\u2014 melded together to form a conclusion I never thought to reach. Heavy boots waking me from my slumber, red and blue lights flashing outside my window; the \\'criminal\\' the police were looking for when I was eight suddenly had a name. The \\'convict\\' these same police had scrounged our small apartment for when I was ten was my father.Fast forward seven years, and I\\'m standing in a classroom in South Korea. I had just given a speech in my Korean language class about my family, only fumbling over a few words. While my peers gave detailed accounts of the origin of their grandparents, I could only tell the story of my mother, who immigrated alone from a life of abuse in Jamaica to live a hard-working life in America. Because of this, I realized that despite the huge question mark that existed throughout my early life, this did not mean my future had to be a mystery. While I have never been able to gain clarity from my father and have yet to learn all the answers, I am at least learning the answer to \\'what\\'; what my mother\\'s sacrifices mean to me and what I am meant to do with my life.Despite how my tongue had discouraged me in the past, and how lack of communication had stripped clarity from my youth, rather than shying away from using my voice, I flourish when expressing myself in different dialects. My tongue may still become tangled at times, but it is no longer my enemy; instead, it has become my best companion and how I take my experiences and translate them to something meaningful. Now that I have the ability to speak up, I want to help those who are unable to communicate at all where it\\'s most important. I want to become a voice for those who are sick or in need and whose language may not be of the majority, and a voice that calls out for the betterment of generations to come.\"}, {\"index\": 100, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Wow, Katia, that looks great. Now paint the whole thing black.\\' Lucas pointed at the widest paintbrush in the jar and signaled for me to take it. I had just finished a painting, and now I had to destroy it. I had no idea what Lucas thought I would learn from this.\\'So then what am I going to show my mom next week? I\\'m going to tell her I learned how to paint a canvas like a wall?\\' I was appalled at the thought. He was asking me to destroy my own artwork. \\'If you don\\'t do it, I will. And believe me, that\\'ll be much worse for you.\\'He squeezed the tube, and the black paint oozed out onto the palette. \\'Katia, it\\'s just a painting.\\'The paintbrush was about to become an eraser. I slashed the canvas with the brush. I stared into the blackness. It stared directly back at me. I made another stroke. The monster was growing, swallowing my rich reds, blues, and violets. All the colors were disappearing under the thin but potent layer of black. Suddenly, I was staring at a painting, but there wasn\\'t anything there. If I closed my eyes, I would still see the same color: black. Lucas wanted it to feel liberating, but it didn\\'t. All I wanted to do was scratch off the black paint and reveal my artwork underneath. \\'Do you understand? Death chaperones growth. Learning how to destroy your artwork is part of becoming an artist. You need to learn how to let go of your composition and allow its destiny to be out of your control. You have to learn this lesson, even if you don\\'t understand it yet. Let\\'s try this again.\\' I didn\\'t want to understand, and I didn\\'t want to learn about how to let go of my composition. I was learning how to develop as an artist, not how to paint an endless stack of black canvases. But still, Lucas handed me another canvas. This time, it was of a painting he had done: a still life of fruit intertwined with vintage jewelry. Just like before, Lucas handed me the widest paintbrush. \\'It should be easy this time, you\\'ve already done it once,\\' Lucas said.But I felt even worse. I was about to destroy a painting that had not been created by me. All I could imagine were the countless hours of tireless work that would disappear under a thin layer of black paint. I slashed the canvas. This time, it was with more intention. I sectioned off the painting into triangles, destroying the composition piece by piece. It was then that I understood what Lucas was trying to teach me: destroying art forces me to decide what I am going to create before I actually create it. When I choose to paint in a specific way, I am destroying all the other possibilities that I have yet to discover. Through these choices, I let the art create me. I didn\\'t need Lucas to tell me what I had just understood. All he said was, \\'Now, let\\'s begin making art.\\'\"}, {\"index\": 101, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'You guys have helped me grow in more ways than you can imagine. I\\'ll remember this day and each one of youforever. This is your win,\\' I say as I lift the trophy for the Best House. Tears run down my face, but I\\'m notembarrassed, not anymore, not in front of my house-mates.House captaincy wasn\\'t my first student council position, nor has it been the most challenging leadership rolesince. However, that role taught me more than any other leadership experience.I distinctly remember election day. It was suddenly preponed, and extreme nervousness coursed through me whenwe were asked to address the house impromptu. I spoke last, following two sophomores and a ninth-gradeclassmate. After a nervous beginning, the fear washed away and my passion took over. I was elated to see my victory margin eventually.My journey as house captain was full of challenges, but they only made me stronger. We had finished last for twoyears, in fourth position. The two biggest issues were the lack of house spirit and the ridiculously low participation.My priority was to overcome these. I instituted bonding games in house meetings. Every member was encouragedto trust one another and have each other\\'s back always, and demonstrate pride on being a member of the House.With our house master\\'s support, I pioneered a monthly intra-house sports event for our house in every fourthhouse meeting. This helped us identify each member\\'s strengths, thus ensuring that everyone participated in theinter-house events as per their interest. Our participation doubled that year.It took countless hours of practice and pep-talks to turn half-hearted attempts into strong performances. My sportscaptain helped me keep the squad motivated, practising repeatedly in the heat. The team\\'s hard work bore fruit aswe won event after event.These experiences didn\\'t just improve my public speaking and confidence levels, they taught me how to strengthenbonds, work as a team, improve productivity, make difficult decisions, and handle criticism. Being tagged as thebest house captain they could\\'ve had was icing on the cake.The high school I attended during freshman and sophomore years wasn\\'t too flexible with subject choices forIGCSE. I\\'ve enjoyed Economics from the time I was introduced to the basics of commerce in 8th Grade. Naturally, Iwanted to take classes in IGCSE too. However, my school allowed us to take either Physics or Economics. Certainthat I wanted to study both subjects, and that I couldn\\'t do Physics all on my own, I chose Economics as a selfstudy subject.Throughout 9th and 10th grade, I learnt Economics at home using online videos and textbooks. I tried to keep upwith my peers who attended classes in school. I gave semester exams in school to know where I stood, and to mysurprise, I topped every time. This provided me with that extra motivation and self-confidence to keep going.Although it proved challenging to balance the self-study with other school subjects, I planned ahead of time andmaintained a strict schedule to remain focused.My school did not offer Additional Mathematics at all. I only found out about the subject in 10th grade when Iattended an orientation at Singapore International School (SIS). They recommended that I take the subject if Iwanted to pursue Mathematics HL in IB. So, I self-studied Additional Mathematics for 4 months before taking theexam. I made it a point to take help from my Mathematics teacher at school whenever needed. The trick was tostay determined and not give up.Lastly, I was unable to take Computer Science classes in IGCSE. In fact, a primary reason for switching to SIS wasthat they had a good IB Computer Science program. Most students here had taken Computer Science in IGCSEand seemed to know a lot of the concepts already. Hence, the course progressed quickly. However, I worked hard,utilized my free periods to meet the teacher, and grabbed every resource available. Now, I consistently compete forthe top spot.It\\'s been a huge challenge overcoming my IGCSE school\\'s limitations, but I\\'ve tackled them successfully throughhard work, perseverance, and a positive attitude. My love for technology began at the age of eight when I first watched the movie Iron Man. I was in complete awe ofJ.A.R.V.I.S, the A.I. system Tony Stark built. The thought of creating this near perfect, life-like system, which, albeitabsent physically, could still perform unimaginable tasks was just astounding. What began as a fascination for J.A.R.V.I.S soon became a passion for computer science. I wanted to delvedeeper, but I had to start with basic programming. I started tinkering with QBASIC. As rudimentary as this was, itwas enough to expose me to the potential of computers.As time progressed, I taught myself basic C++ and Java. These languages made me feel uninhibited. So, whenIndia adopted a unified GST tax code, I secured an internship with a company that was developing a GST TaxEngine for large banks. The first summer, I primarily studied the indirect tax structure in India, the new tax code,the business need for the software and the proposed functionalities of the web-based application. This summer, Iwent straight from playing pickup games to the NBA! I was able to contribute to the back-end coding andrecommend improved screens for the application. Being a part of a professional software development team gaveme tremendous perspective and practical knowledge.When I visited a village school in India last summer, I identified an opportunity to use technology to transformstudents\\' lives. I created a mobile app to teach English to children in rural areas. The app has already beenadopted by the school and has made a huge impact on the students. It will soon be adopted by multiple schools in2 states.I\\'m known as the tech wizard in school. I\\'m the technology head for the first-ever TEDx event at school, and for mycomputer science internal assessment, I\\'ve developed a resource- management system for a client. ComputerScience isn\\'t just my deep passion. To me, it represents the infinite potential of a synergistic relationship betweenhumans and machines, one that I want to tap into to improve as many lives as possible. My mother hails from a small rural Indian town and although I was born and raised in California initially, I feel partof the rural Indian community. We moved to India when I was five and I live with my grandparents for a one montheach year during vacations.In the summer of 2015 when I was on my usual visit, I accompanied my grandfather to a village school where hewas invited to speak. I was in for an unexpected jolt. Despite being an English-medium school, the level of Englishthere was abysmal. Not just the students, even the teachers couldn\\'t speak passable English.Since colonisation, English has become the generally accepted business language in India. Most jobs todayrequire a proficiency in English, and our country\\'s progress depends on it. This played on my mind and I feltcompelled to do something to help.I spent that entire summer with the students, understanding their lifestyle. I learnt that there was no exposure toEnglish in their daily lives. That\\'s when my journey with the rural school began. Technology being my greatestpassion, I naturally turned to it for a solution. My first action was that of introducing an E-learning software, one thatI had customised for the rural need. I started the program for Grades 1-4.When I visited in 2017, small improvements were evident. I even saw a parent touch the principal\\'s feet, thankinghim for his child\\'s progress in English. Extremely motivated by this, I started developing a mobile app which wouldenable students to view the E-learning videos at home and share them with their families, whilst allowing teachersto access regular reports for each student\\'s activity on the application.The app was launched in the school this summer, and the District-Education-Officer commended my initiative atthe launch. The government will soon take the app state-wide in 2 states. What started as an attempt to improve afew lives has already impacted so many families. I now truly understand what it means to give back to society, andhow to become a catalyst for change.Growing up, the concept of service was forced upon me. At first by my parents, and then school. My parentsthought some service would turn me into a bona fide Mother Teresa. It began with a weekly clean-up of our localbeach, which was littered with more trash than sand. In school, they dangled the carrot of extra credits toencourage us. At the time, however, my malaise outweighed my desire to do things for others.In the summer of 2015, I was in a rural Indian town, visiting family. My grandfather was invited to speak at a villageschool and I accompanied him. I was in for an unexpected jolt. Forget the students or their parents, even teacherswere unable to speak English intelligibly. And this was an English medium school.Since colonization, instead of the many regional languages, English has come to be the generally acceptedbusiness language in India. Most jobs today require a proficiency in English. Our country\\'s progress depends on it,and so I failed to understand the reason for the abysmal levels of English that I was witnessing.Upon interacting with the principal, I realized that the root cause wasn\\'t the lack of effort, but rather the lack ofresources and environment. It was a vicious cycle, wherein teachers taught incorrect English, and their studentstaught the same way in the future.Maybe it was the shock, but I felt compelled to do something. I spent the rest of the summer with these students,understanding their lifestyle. The deeper I probed, the more I learnt that there was no exposure to English at homeand in their daily lives. I wanted to bring about a change.Technology being my greatest passion, I naturally turned to it for a solution. After a lot of discussions andresearch, I located an organisation with a specialized software to teach English through videos and teacherdependent activities, customized for rural India. The first stumbling block I hit was that the owners did not want thevideos circulated commercially. After repeated meetings though, I was able to convince them that the videoswould be used securely within the school and without any profits.I spent the rest of the year working on creating unit plans and segregating the videos class-wise. The followingsummer, I began sessions in the school. I trained the teachers and took their feedback to refine the system.When I visited in 2017, the small changes were evident. Students were conversing in broken English and theteachers welcomed me with open arms. This was indeed motivating. The next step was to provide a conduciveenvironment at home. I proposed a mobile app that could enable students to view the videos at home and sharethem with their families.The principal was thrilled by the idea. I spent the next year developing a mobile application. It gave studentsindividual logins and allowed them to view the videos unit-wise, as they learnt in school. Each time they viewed avideo, it would get recorded in a database. A weekly-report would get generated for each student and mailed tothe teacher.This year, the app was launched in the school. The District-Education-Officer attended the launch and was keen totake the app state-wide. The app now has a life of its own and will soon be implemented in multiple schools in 2states. My satisfaction didn\\'t come from the app, or the fact that I was involved in what was perceived as a bigservice project, but rather by seeing the difference it made to those kids and their families.In hindsight, I was perhaps the biggest beneficiary of the project.

The app now has a life of its own and will be taken state-wide, thanks to the DEO.

I did well in school, and I ended up going to the best junior high in the district. It wasn\\'t until then that I realized what thatC meant. The stark contrast in race (my middle school was mostly white), in people who didn\\'t eat school lunch, and in student behavior was clear - I had gone to a \\'bad\\' school. Middle school me wanted to move to Park Slope and be like every other kid who lived in a brownstone instead of acramped apartment like mine. When I moved on to attend one of NYC\\'s best public high schools, I realized going to a good school is a privilege because of the disparity between good schools and schools with minorities in funding, in resources, and, in turn, the environment. I learned that it was not possible to just up and move wherever was convenient,not then anyways. Everything I want, I would have to work for myself. I am a low-income, Asian female, and will-be first generation college student who comes from a long line of working class factory workers. An education means something different for everybody.

But I live for the heat mercilessly scorching my face and arms, leaving my skin pink and throbbing. I am vitalized by the blazing ball of white hot glass at the end of my blowpipe, calling forth fiery determination to pulse through my veins. The glass smiles brilliantly at me like a little sun, begging me to shape, pull, and stretch it before it loses its malleability. I move quickly with my crystalline blob to the workbench, where it is a race with the heat to swiftly alter the glass before its molten gleam dulls to an unyielding cherry tint. Some might peer into the glassworking furnace and call the flaming orb Hell, but that inferno is my Heaven.Glass is the most difficult medium with which I work, but it is my ardent favorite. A stiff cylinder of cold glass morphs gracefully into the ethereal shell of an amber purple turtle. An amorphous lump is blown, pinched, and tugged every which way to form an elegant, green vase with stripes like lace- the transformation awes me every time.Once when making a rainbow unicorn, I accidentally grazed the tip of my finger on a cooling hoof, and the glass immediately gripped and seared my flesh, puckering it before I pulled the hot glass off. For a long moment I stared dumbstruck at the pink divot where the glass had briefly kissed, like a lover trying to comprehend a betrayal. Yet the stench of burning skin aroused my mind with realization. Why would I jeopardize my body, safety, and sanity to create such tiny pieces of art? I then grasped the full power of this extraordinary medium- part of its beauty comes from the risk, which oddly invigorates and entices me. I have to be wholly present when I work with glass, to guard against any slip which could burn my skin clean off the bone. I live for the thrill, but also the immense danger of glassworking as they are perpetually interdependent. I am willing to risk everything for the wonder that strikes me every time I transform a hot, heavy glob into a sculpture of frozen light.\\'Can you see my inner energy\\\\u2026,\\' a glass prism hums, as it refracts seemingly white light into its true brilliant rainbow. I watch entropy in action: the glass seems smooth, clear, and flawless at first, but it feeds on light, distorting brightness until the output is gleaming flecks of beautiful chaos. I love the contradictory nature of glass\\\\u00ad- solid yet fluid, inertial yet so dynamic as it changes colors and shapes in shifting light. It\\'s a paradox: the crystalline curves haphazardly spew out radiance in such a systematic fashion. Glass reminds me how durable yet fragile we all are, how tough and weighty we appear in our bodies, but how easily shattered we actually are.I am a creator, and I wish to forge with a free mind and limitless imagination in college and beyond. Thinking about my glassmaking reminds me of the Latin phrase \\'ars longa, vita brevis\\'- art is long, life is short. To me, these words signify that art is forever, while life is fleeting. Even after my bodily self is gone, someone in the future will unearth one of my glass creations and behold my story and my creativity preserved in its icy depths. I want my art to endlessly inspire people well beyond my own lifetime. Art allows my imagination and ideas to withstand the test of time, and it is my way of combating the painful brevity of human life: art endures as our legacy even after mankind flickers out. Art is immortality, and we will be eternal through art.I met Mark Zuckerberg at a barbecue when I was a carefree tween just old enough to sign up for Facebook. I did not imagine that only 4 years later I would be contacting him as a potential business partner.For the past two summers, I worked as the youngest intern for a startup company called Jobcase, which runs a social media platform aimed at empowering and networking blue collar workers. I pursued this job because of my interest in social media and its power to create community. I was especially excited because Jobcase is uniquely focused on wage-workers, a demographic which has been excluded by Linkedin and other large job search companies. By giving blue collar workers a place to share experiences, information, and encouragement, Jobcase is improving the lives of its 72 million users.On our first day at work, the CEO of Jobcase announced to the summer interns, \\'This company takes inspiration from Facebook.\\' I was struck by the thought that Facebook could likewise be inspired by Jobcase, and decided to make that connecting the two companies my personal goal. With this budding personal project in mind, I joined a team that provided employment leads and advice to Jobcasers and integrated isolated workers into the platform. I was excited to quickly earn greater responsibility with independent projects. For my project to combat post-prison recidivism, I identified companies which would hire ex-prisoners and connected released prisoners to local reentry programs. I also created and moderated a group called \\'Childcare\\' where I led discussions about the care industry and assisted with job placement for childcare workers.Passion for \\'Project Facebook\\' drove me to the office early many mornings as the gears in my mind spun at top speed, propelling me towards my ambitious destination. Seeking to scale the Facebook wall, I researched Facebook\\'s initiatives as well as its CEO\\'s personal ventures, looking for toeholds to chisel so that I could pique Zuckerberg\\'s interest and advance our mutual goals. I focused on Facebook\\'s new venture called \\'Facebook at Work\\', as well as on the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative\\'s mission to improve individual opportunities through social media. With this vision in mind, I emailed Mark Zuckerberg one June morning with a request to meet and discuss how we could inspire each other. To my great surprise, Zuckerberg replied within a few hours expressing interest in Jobcase\\'s mission and inviting us to meet with Facebook\\'s top management in Silicon Valley later in the summer to discuss my ideas. This swift, affirmative reply jolted me into bellowing into the silence of the open office, \\'Zuck said yes!\\', an exclamation more evocative of a successful promposal. I tore out of my seat and hurtled triumphantly towards my boss, who looked both alarmed and amused, as electrifying excitement swept through the office.On the August day when I finally made my way to the Facebook headquarters, clutching a leather notebook crammed with my notes and aspirations, I harkened back to my feckless tween self meeting Mark Zuckerberg for the first time. I reflected on how high one can ascend with creativity, initiative, hard work, and audacity (and a little bit of luck). Bringing Jobcase, a startup with only 80 employees at the time, across the conference table from an industry giant like Facebook made me proud to have orchestrated such a seemingly impossible meeting. I am excited for Jobcase\\'s future and cannot wait to build on our fledgling venture with Facebook. Through this work experience, I learned that life should not just be about taking opportunities, but about boldly creating opportunities for oneself and for others. This lesson is one that I will never forget.I met Mark Zuckerberg at a barbecue when I was a carefree tween just old enough to sign up for Facebook. I did not imagine that only 4 years later I would be contacting him as a potential business partner. For the past two summers, I worked as the youngest intern for a startup company called Jobcase, which runs a social media platform aimed at empowering and networking blue collar workers. I pursued this job because of my interest in social media and its power to create community. I was especially excited because Jobcase is unique in its focus on service and trade workers, a demographic which has been ignored by Linkedin and other large job search companies. By giving wage-workers a place to share experiences, information, and encouragement, Jobcase is improving the lives of its 70 million users.On our first day at work, the CEO of Jobcase announced to the summer interns, \\'This company takes inspiration from Facebook.\\' I was struck by the thought that Facebook could likewise be inspired by Jobcase, and decided to make that my personal goal. With this budding personal project on the side, my duties were to showcase successful Jobcase users and build a stronger Jobcase community by integrating isolated workers into the platform. We even managed to get Jobcase on the Jumbotron at Fenway at a Red Sox game! Passion for \\'Project Facebook\\' drove me to the office early many mornings as the gears in my mind spun at top speed, propelling me towards my ambitious destination. Seeking to scale the Facebook wall, I researched Facebook\\'s initiatives as well as its CEO\\'s personal ventures, looking for toeholds to chisel so that I could pique Zuckerberg\\'s interest and advance our mutual goals. After identifying that both Facebook and Jobcase sought to enhance human potential and opportunity through building networks, I focused on Facebook\\'s workplace platforms as well as on the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative\\'s mission to improve individual opportunities through social media. With this vision in mind, I began crafting a request for a meeting to brainstorm how Jobcase and Facebook could inspire each other. I emailed Mark Zuckerberg one June morning, wondering how many days it would be courteous to wait before bugging him again. To my great surprise, he replied within a few hours expressing interest in my ideas and inviting us to meet in Silicon Valley for a discussion. His swift, affirmative reply jolted me into bellowing at the top of my lungs into the silence of the open office, \\'Zuck said yes!\\', an exclamation more evocative of a successful promposal. I tore out of my seat and hurtled triumphantly towards my boss, who looked both alarmed and amused, as electrifying excitement swept through the office. By the end of the week we had booked a meeting for later in the summer, and for the next month I continued to work on my internship responsibilities while also preparing for the meeting. On the August day when I finally made my way to the Facebook headquarters, clutching my leather notebook crammed with notes and aspirations, I harkened back to my feckless tween self meeting Mark Zuckerberg for the first time, and I reflected on how high one can ascend with creativity, initiative, hard work, and audacity. I cannot wait to return to Jobcase next summer to build on our fledgling venture with Facebook. Through my summer experience, I learned that life should not just be about taking opportunities, but about boldly creating opportunities for oneself and for others. It was fulfilling to have succeeded by taking a risk, and this lesson is one that I will bring with me to college and beyond. \"}, {\"index\": 104, \"new_personal_statement\": \"On the makeshift stage at the Siddhi Vinayak temple, deep in Central Mumbai, the spotlight illuminated me. I balanced, in Dhanupada, a posture embodying Lord Krishna, trembling as the fear of judgment clouded my otherwise confident sensibilities. Adorned with bold, expressive makeup, I danced my first solo at Mumbai\\'s largest Odissi performance, a celebration of Indian classical dance, in front of a sea of Indians from all strata. Sensing that the cameras would broadcast my every mistake, I froze, each droplet of sweat weighing me down.Onstage, I am Krishnaji, the mischievous blue-god, metaphorically tied to a tree, constrained by ropes. My guilty eyes ask, archly, should I be stationary as Ma Devaki, my mother desires, or should I escape my forest abode, by gracefully liberating myself from the rope\\'s hold, mirroring the fluidity with which the waters of Yamuna River, flowing beside me, find their own path\\\\u2026Just like the water, I charted my odyssey at the DAIS chemistry laboratory, which emerged alongside the Mithi River in the erstwhile Salsette forest. Here, I dipped my toes into what became my fiercest passion\\\\u2014 water chemistry. Here, I connected the dots between water hardness and kidney stones. And here, I regenerated the acid cation resins, ready to deep-dive into softening hard-water.My surroundings are rendered soft as the ripples of the melody flow through the auditorium, much like the metaphorical Yamuna River flowing alongside. The soft melody is as soothing as the seamless flow of water, yet my movements fail to mirror that fluidity. Struggling to identify the source of this obstacle blocking my flowing movements on stage, I seek inspiration in my sanctuary, the laboratory.At the lab table, I lithely, instinctively, attach the resin-filled burette to the clamp stand. To break such delicate glassware is tantamount to falling off the stage. The first water sample embarks on its smooth, silky journey through the funnel, down the burette, into the beaker waiting below. The beaker swallows the first drop, signaling the success of my methodology. I feel liberated. My heavy headgear no longer weighs me down. What was once inhibiting is now emancipating, empowering my footwork, even as the flair of my ocean-blue dhoti, harmoniously guides my torso to the rhythm. I feel emotions surge through me like water, drop by drop,as the hard-water traverses, finding its path through the resins. I wait for the moment the resins will cling onto the scale-forming calcium cations releasing sodium cations instead. The background noises crescendo \\\\u2013 I love the lab, my other auditorium. Awaiting the splash of the final droplet, I realize that my struggle to emote onstage can be paralleled to the droplet\\'s struggle of dodging misdirecting resins as it forges through the burette. The ropes tying me to the tree loosen. Guruji\\'s peremptory voice echoes, \\'Your body tells me one thing, but your face another. Make them one.\\' My internal turmoil, to dance \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018perfectly\\', heightens. I struggle to emote, to \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018be\\' Krishna.The ropes are looser now.The final droplet splashes.The ropes fall. Unfettered, I\\'ve induced my facial expressions to flow with my movements. I\\'ve overcome my fear of judgment as I strike my final pose. I\\'ve softened hard water, confirming my hypothesis. Is it possible for two distinct entities to be so unrelated yet so interconnected? Each time I dance before Yamuna River, I realize how scarce potable water truly is. Unlike the abundance that flows within my dancing self, I realize that it doesn\\'t flow through the taps of households. Water has become visceral to me, enabling me to embody it instead of feeling it \\\\u2013 in the auditorium of the lab, in the auditorium of the stage, at the stage of my life. That my groundbreaking observation can inspire future courses of treatment for kidney stones elates me. The end of my experiment and that of my dance performance indicate the start of another journey.The long-jump pit was raked ready. Diya, a third-grade Panther House contender, was up next, and fearful. She turned to me, her House Captain, for support.I knew that look. Not long ago, it was me who turned to my captains seeking comfort. Throughout my tenure I made it a point to personally get to know my House members. Having observed Diya at House events, I was reminded of her perennial spirit and evergreen smile, characteristics that embodied her identity. Every recess, Diya\\'s sonorous laughter would echo through the school\\'s nooks and crannies. This melody, coupled with her enthusiastic cheer, motivated her group of friends as they jump roped. She was truly a Panther.Now sporting dampened doe eyes, a scrunched nose, and a puckered mouth, Diya\\'s expression betrayed her vivacious nature. I could sense something amiss. This was my turning point. My role as House captain, previously limited to helping organise events and compiling participant lists, now extended to that of a mentor, of a friend, and of family. I noticed Diya\\'s eyes dart from senior-to-senior. The pool of high-school spectators made her nervous. Expectations inhibited her self-confidence. Determined to reignite her concealed fearlessness, I bent down, holding her gaze. I told her to liberate her inner caged-bird, to fly, to enjoy herself. Making long-jump a game for her, I asked, \\'Where do you want to land? Come on, let\\'s do this together! We can do it. We are the Panthers, one pack. We leap far.\\' With her newfound sense of purpose, Diya bounded past the now nebulous onlookers. Unknowingly, Diya inspired me to imbue the House-motto, \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Pride, Power, Perseverance\\', amongst fellow cubs. The Panther House community, my second family, surfaced the leader in me. Through personal interactions with every member, I fostered inclusivity throughout age groups. Now a close-knit family, we celebrate our victories and shoulder our losses; right from winning the House Championship to placing last in every sporting event. Today, my House has redefined happiness for me. It now stems from the ability to instill smiles amidst tears. Happiness, for me, is my House, my community.Guruji\\'s voice echoes, \\'Your body tells me one thing, but your face another. Make them one.\\' My inner turmoil, to dance \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018perfectly\\', to synchronize my torso to the beat, heightens. I struggle to emote\\\\u2014the essence of this Indian classical dance, Odissi. My mother has always pushed me to go \\'immerse myself in India\\'s exotic culture\\'. Now, with the innocence of a five-year-old, being urged to do something came the pressure to \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018impress\\'. Fast-forward six years, I found myself onstage at Mumbai\\'s iconic Siddhi Vinayak temple. The spotlight illuminated me. I balanced, trembling as the fear of judgment clouded my otherwise confident sensibilities. Adorned with bold makeup, I danced my first solo at Mumbai\\'s largest Odissi performance. Sensing that the cameras would broadcast my mistakes, I froze. It felt as if ropes constrained my every movement, rendering me motionless.With discomfort settling in my chest, my eyes frantically scanned the auditorium, desperate to seek Guruji\\'s comfort. Her eyes caught mine. Her expression was indescribable: akin to a reassuring smile laced with faith, but so much more. This was my turning point. While introspecting, I realised that I wasn\\'t dancing for anybody but myself. The ropes loosened.My heavy headgear no longer weighed me down. What was once inhibiting was now emancipating, years of effort finally bore fruit. Every strike of my foot elicited a surge of emotions. A stream of endless onlookers expectantly held my gaze. Unfettered, I had induced my facial expressions to flow with my movements. Odissi, in my eyes, was redefined.The ropes came undone. Their only remnant being the course red marks that kissed my wrists.Today, I wear these metaphorical \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018red bangles\\' with pride. They exemplify my desire to be a part of a culturally vibrant community, one that I actively work to give back to through my website \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Odissi Odyssey\\'. They symbolize the raw essence of my journey that delineated my talent. They are a reminder of the gratitude I harbor for my mother\\\\u2014what was initially a class she forced me to attend, is now one I find myself clearing my schedule for. In 2015 my sixty-eight year old grandmother was diagnosed with kidney-stones. While a fairly common condition, the pain she experienced can only be described as tormenting. As I reflected upon the cause of her condition, I saw that the March 9th, 2016 edition of The Guardian reported: \\'Number of kidney stone cases increases by 115% in 10 years.\\' What could be causing this increase?I turned to chemistry for solutions. Once my greatest weakness, this subject is now my defining strength. Under the guidance of Dr. Mariwala, founder of Scientific Precision, the fundamentals of water chemistry adopted the fourth dimension. He challenged me to re-evaluate my approach by connecting pre-existing research with original approaches.The result: investigating the correlation between kidney-stones and hard-water, simultaneously evaluating water softening techniques.Location one\\\\u2014 my study table. Laptop open, tabs overflowing. One question from Dr. Mariwala, \\'What is water?\\' had me re-evaluate all my research. This simple yet intrinsically complicated question demanded work.Location two\\\\u2014 the laboratory. Apparatus scattered, resins regenerated. I moved from station-to-station, measuring water\\'s hardness and alkalinity. Following the methodology was easy, but improvising it required a whole new skill set; one that required patience and multiple trials. Connecting the two, I asked myself, \\'How was the Langelier Saturation Index going to indicate whether my ceaseless efforts correlated to kidney-stones?\\' I was at the pinnacle. An empty document titled \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Conclusion and Evaluation\\' awaited my response. Post deep introspection, I completed my investigation.A weak, albeit positive correlation between hard-water and kidney-stones emerged. The thought of having validated a possible alternative treatment excites me. This drives my desire to unravel the water molecule\\'s intrinsic secret, fuelling my curiosity to learn. My eagerness to provide sufficient drinking-water to reduce the incidence of preventable diseases is motivated by my aspiration to be an environmentally and socially aware scientist whose impact transcends laboratory bounds.UCLA\\'s rigorously engaging curriculum allows me to interact with like-minded people. I hope to one day join SMACS, participate in the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Chemistry Bowl Competition\\', and discuss the evolution of artificial enzymes with Prof. Alexandrova, channeling my inner-chemist like never before.\\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Mo(ve)ment of Joy\\' (MOJ), a regional sports movement that aims to redefine sports and create opportunities for the less privileged, emanated from my love for football and squash. In leading the MOJ team, I brought together individuals from diverse backgrounds, with the common goal of creating an impact in our community through sports. We invited students from multiple non-profits, low-income schools, and the slums to participate in sporting endeavours against our school\\'s teams. Here, I saw the visually impaired throw Mumbai\\'s top judokas, the hearing-impaired beat our basketball team and slum-children outrace national athletes. Abled, skilled, and determined, I realized that they deserved opportunities that currently lay beyond their reach.Three-hundred municipal coaches were connected with sports aficionados on a common platform, building a network with renowned sports educators. Through \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Coach to Coach\\', we laid emphasis on the importance of a coach\\'s role in a sportsman\\'s journey. As a means to facilitate these opportunities, we persuaded sponsors to invest $22,000 through MOJ\\'s \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018National Squash Tournament\\' to support over a thousand sports-driven slum-dwellers to help them reach their potential. The teamwork and coordination skills we built while organizing this event\\\\u2014right from planning the social media layout to interacting with the Squash Racket Federation of India, from encouraging participation to organizing logistics\\\\u2014 challenged the scope of my leadership abilities.Throughout my journey, the experience of trying to persuade parents of low-income families to recognize how important sports are for a child\\'s development was perhaps my most satisfying accomplishment. This was my \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018moment of joy\\': discovering that sports have the potential to transcend socioeconomic, age and gender barriers.\"}, {\"index\": 105, \"new_personal_statement\": \"My junior year, creative problem solving took on a new meaning for me when my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. To help with the challenges arising from her chemotherapy, I found solutions with creativity and love.Chemotherapy killed my mom\\'s taste buds, and her once-favorite foods became difficult to swallow. I knew she needed her nutrition; I thought, if she were to try foods that she hasn\\'t eaten before, she would have no prior expectation of their flavor, so she wouldn\\'t be as disappointed. Every night, I would cook her different foods from different cuisines. I was ecstatic when she enjoyed them a lot more.However, another problem arose. A few hours after eating her meals, she would become nauseous and vomit her food, undigested. Her doctor told her this was normal. I knew vomiting was a side effect of chemotherapy, but I refused to accept that there was nothing I could do about it. Exercising, I thought, could be a possible solution. If she moved around, I thought, it could help my mom\\'s body actively digest food. I knew this wouldn\\'t solve the entire problem, but I hoped it would make a difference. So, I\\'d go on walks with my mom to encourage her to move around, and bought her new, comfortable shoes when her feet were swollen. As she had more chemo treatments, she became too tired to get out of bed. I created a workout for her to do in bed, consisting of leg lifts, crunches (with me holding down her legs), and arm circles \\\\u2014 all done without standing up. The exercise did help my mom\\'s digestion. It also helped her in ways I didn\\'t imagine: going on walks helped her calm her mind, and exercising together in bed gave us another way to bond together. An act of creativity not only brought a solution to a problem, but it also created happy memories.

As Sunja, the Korean protagonist, grappled with a forced marriage, I relived my own moments of captivity and coercion. As she became paralyzed with feelings of inadequacy, I retreated into a cycle of self-doubt and pain.For ten years, my mind had buried that traumatic hour. And yet, it took only a few pages of a book to bring back every minute of what had happened, first in a blur, then in horrible clarity. I tried to deny it until it couldn\\'t be denied any longer. That night, I stayed awake, unable to think.I tried to move on, rationalizing my silence. However, a few weeks after, the silence became unbearable. I was moderating a meeting circle for the young women\\'s professional mentorship program that I had co-founded a year prior. Each week, we would share our thoughts and experiences on a variety of topics. This week, I initiated the conversation with a question, \\'How has your past informed your ambitions?\\'The circle began normally enough. Hoa talked about receiving criticism for being the first in her family to go to college, Ngoc relayed a childhood moment, and Nga spoke about the sexist environment of her rural hometown. When it was my turn, I wanted to say something, tell someone. But I said nothing. The circle continued clockwise.Several turns later, Huyen spoke up: \\'My uncle assaulted me when I was ten. I struggled to think rationally about the assault for a long time.\\' Silence filled the room. I felt compelled to tell her she wasn\\'t alone her in pain. But it was Quynh-Anh who broke the silence: \\'My father abused me for two years.\\' As other group members offered their consolations to the two women, my compulsion to speak grew. Yet still, I couldn\\'t. The circle dispersed.Back home, I felt disappointed in myself. For over a year, I had been working to empower these women and emphasizing the importance of being vocal, yet in their most vulnerable moment, I was not brave enough to heed my own advice. My identity as an outspoken feminist felt fraudulent, my advocacy hollow.For some reason, I found myself reaching for the familiar pages of Pachinko. Though it brought back my trauma, I felt compelled to know what happened to Sunja.When I reached the novel\\'s powerful end, where Sunja rises above her oppression, I was struck by an overwhelming realization. Here was a work of fiction, set a century ago, in a culture foreign from my own \\\\u2014and yet it reached beyond all those barriers to leave a lasting impact on me. Every chapter moved me, every character resonated.I finally understood the power of narrative. To tell a story is to invite others to inhabit our memories, feel our pain, experience our trauma. It creates an empathetic link that brings survivors out of isolation. It combats ignorance. It sparks action.I wasn\\'t ready for the emotional strain of sharing my own experience before, but now I am ready to join Huyen and Quynh-Anh in our growing circle of support. I reached out to my teacher, my counselor, and now to you. With each telling, I gain more confidence to tell others, until, eventually, I face my family.No matter what the repercussions, I will remain a storyteller, not just retelling my own trauma but also transmitting to the community the urgent need to protect women. I see myself adding my voice to those of journalists and activists who have alerted the world to the sexually assaulted women Rohingya refugees, to the Indian rape survivors who live in inequity, to the confined, the marginalized, the neglected. By speaking out, we gain strength; by empowering others to speak, we step away from the pain of the past and move closer towards justice.\"}, {\"index\": 107, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Dear Shahzaib,You might not remember me. I don\\'t blame you, as I probably didn\\'t stand out much. But, I remember you, and I\\'vemade it my life\\'s mission to help people like you.I still remember, it was a muggy Friday afternoon when I walked to shop with my latest obsession withSchrodinger\\'s thought experiment stuck on my mind. Amid the cacophony of traffic, I heard the squeaky voice of ateen clad in an excuse of a shirt.\\'Please, spare me some change,\\' you said in a trivially childish voice. After a brief moral war, I handed you a 10rupee note and shot a question \\'Why don\\'t you go to school?\\' to which you answered \\'There is no school that myfather can afford. When that changes, I will go.\\' You said this with a practiced, nonchalant shrug - one thatmasked the weight of a tumultuous childhood.Problems are funny little gremlins; when they\\'re ours, problems are nothing but a hindrance - but, when theybelong to others, problems become an opportunity. They offer a chance at greatness. So, when I first met you, Irecognized that it was my time to rise above.I have problems of my own, too; like the time I had to take the reins and steer my family\\'s business after my dadsustained serious injuries in an accident leaving me with the option to work else family would starve. But overallexperience was very rich as I learned ethics of business and the value of mental fortitude. I thought my plight wasmiserable but after meeting you I realized kids like you had it worse.I spent countless hours thinking about what I could do for children like you and soon realized that I can at leastteach children like you.Soon, I started my own social venture TechSoCh, Technology for Social Change, with other motivated individualsfrom not only India but also from six other third world countries. We realized the problem was at a very basic level.Poverty cannot be averted by simply giving bookish knowledge but a lot of work needed to be done and the firstthing was to make people aware of government policies and their rights. Then there were challenges ofmalnutrition, employment generation, lack of basic infrastructure etc. We started working on all fronts likeengaging youths in skill development programs, distributing food in underprivileged areas, taking classes of smallchildren and encouraging them for studies, making women and other family members aware of all governmentpolicies and their rights to get those benefits etc.The State Government, after noticing our work, invited me to work on their child development projects andawarded me with a Certificate of Honour. I imagined you up on the dais being handed the award with me.Shahzaib, I want you to know that your efforts are not in vain - you are not unrecognized. I recognize that ourexistence is but a tiny speck in the wheel of time and that my efforts may never amount to anything significantgiven the scale of poverty, illiteracy, and unemployment within our country. Still, my stubborn heart remainsunconvinced, because I am steadfast.Our paths have not since crossed, but I hope that my efforts - and those of better men - have touched your lifethrough TechSoCH- an initiative to bring a positive change in the society with the help of science & technology.I imagine you in school, learning and growing to meet your full potential. I wonder if you\\'re now aware that yourname means \\'Crown of the King.\\' Shahzaib, I know it may be but a dream, but I hope you will join me. For, even ifwe fail, we will have devoted great effort to the greater good.I hope you will remember me as more than a stranger on the street.Abhinav.\"}, {\"index\": 108, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I\\'d always agreed with Mr. Butler during his frequent after-dinner political conversations with my father. As my dad, a staunch Republican, and Terry, a self-declared socialist, debated I would sit on my dad\\'s lap and defend every point he made. This blind acceptance was short-lived. The older I got, and the more I was exposed to other beliefs, my faith in my parents\\' politics was challenged. By Obama\\'s second term, I vigorously endorsed the \\'standard liberal position.\\' One evening, the topic was inequality in public education. Terry got up to refill his drink and said, \\'Not that you\\'d even look at their website, but The Atlantic had an article about how teachers\\' unions want nationalized standards in schools.\\' Predictably, my dad disagreed. He chuckled \\'You\\'re right I\\'d never look at that\\' then rebuked, \\'The mayor\\'s office has to get involved, the federal government\\'s overreach never helped anyone.\\' My dad\\'s point wasn\\'t a pillar of conservatism, but it hinged on decidedly conservative notions of self-sufficiency and small government.I had never been a shy person so, I jumped to counter his point, \\' That\\'s not actually\\\\u2026\\' I hesitated and trailed off.I\\'d assumed that by the time those words had left my mouth a plethora of appropriate responses based on the democratic party\\'s platform values would be on the tip of my tongue. I wasn\\'t prepared for a lack of a counterpoint.I began to realize that my dad was right, at least he was this time. I even found myself disagreeing with Terry\\'s more liberal solution for federal intervention. I\\'d never imagined that I would be in agreement with a card-carrying Republican, but there I was arguing against the most liberal man I knew with Republican logic. I was confused. It wasn\\'t the logic behind the argument that confused me. That made sense. It was that I\\'d never seen merit in a conservative stance, not one on economics or social policy or foreign affairs. It had been my understanding that the \\'standard liberal position\\' I\\'d always endorsed simply had the better answer.The idea that something so central to my belief system may have been untrue unnerved me, so I tried to correct this bias. I went out of my way to speak with the few vocal conservatives at my middle school and even asked if I could meet with a Republican city councilor. The common ground I found led me to see that no one party had the \\'right,\\' infallible solution all of the time and more importantly that even beliefs I\\'d assumed were 100% right had to be questioned. I realized the value in speaking to people with different beliefs, not to convince them of my own but to recognize the faults in my conclusions instead of listening to an echo chamber that constantly agreed with me. I still talked a lot, but now I was much more willing to have what I said be questioned.So the next time I turned around in the front seat of my mom\\'s car to tell my brother just why he was wrong about whatever stance he\\'d taken on our most recent argument, I bit my tongue and asked him to explain himself. This new attitude has allowed me to be more critical of my own thoughts and, after hearing how others saw the issue, better defend my points or change them if necessary. I could see the value in accepting the criticism that exposure to opposing views gave me instead of the comfort that an echo chamber provides. I used to think that the more evidence I had to support my ideas, the more right I was. I was wrong, incredibly so. It isn\\'t how many facts or figures or points I have to corroborate my ideas to justify my views, it\\'s how many opposing arguments I\\'ve been willing to hear.  My first camera was given to me by my godfather on my ninth birthday. The old Olympus OM-1 was dented and scratched, but I loved it. From that day on I was entranced by how the way a shot was framed or filtered could completely change the piece. Throughout high school, I pursued every photography course offered including Senior Thesis Photography. I knew the teacher, Mrs. Tanzman, well, but was nervous to be in a class that required an application and to be surrounded by peers who had made it through a similar vetting process.Our first assignment was a three-piece series and I spent hours perfecting it. Mrs. Tanzman\\'s feedback made it clear these efforts were in vain. She said that if I didn\\'t utilize the \\'rules\\' of the field, like the rule of thirds, then the quality of my work would stagnate. Her critiques came as a surprise, I\\'d never received such harsh feedback, and they felt like a challenge to my prior compositions. I began to question if photography could still be my stress reliever if improving meant following these guidelines, but I made the changes to my color balance and cropping anyway and the results proved Mrs.Tanzman right. What I\\'d once thought was a well-composed series was revealed to be disjointed and lacking a unifying theme. The idea that seemingly subjective art could be created by manipulating something as concrete as the rule of thirds fascinated me. I\\'d always seen photography as a fundamentally creative undertaking, but I\\'d never realized that the structure that the new concepts provided fostered innovative work rather than inhibiting it. I began to see every project as an opportunity to build off of the framework that these \\'new\\' rules provided rather than a blank canvas that would accept whatever I put onto it. This approach helped me learn to work with rather than against the rules not just during photography class. Upon choosing a sport to play my freshman year, I was immediately intrigued by lacrosse, but my relationship with lacrosse had a rocky start. I showed up to tryouts with a boys\\' stick instead of the smaller girls\\' stick, and only caught the ball twice, but I returned the next day with the same nervous enthusiasm. By some miracle, I made the varsity team. I\\'d never had a problem picking up a sport, but the weeks after tryouts were spent with my friends on the field during lunch desperately trying to catch just one pass. I went to every optional practice and early morning workout, but by the first game, I still couldn\\'t cradle the ball. This trend continued for the rest of the season. I\\'d always been a person who enjoyed pushing myself so, despite this my lack of skill, I enjoyed the challenge of a sport I couldn\\'t easily pick up. In the last game of the year, I managed to cradle the ball down the field successfully: a moment that won me the most improved award that year. Although I\\'m proud of how far I\\'ve come since freshman year, the persistence that propelled me to continue with lacrosse despite my less than stellar first season is the skill I\\'m most proud of gaining throughout this process. The persistence that led me to stick with lacrosse and eventually win a starting spot has served me well outside of practice and games as well, by keeping me on track while forming a thesis for an English essay and motivating me to check my citations for the fifth time for my research paper. It has been crucial in keeping me motivated in classes where I struggled and will come in handy during my college years. Going into my sophomore year, I was looking forward to taking my first AP course in U.S. History, but I had resigned myself to the fact that it was unlikely that Native North American history would be in the curriculum. This was a topic I\\'d been interested in for several years and that I had spent several weeks studying the summer before while visiting family on the Texas-Oklahoma border. While doing so, I became interested in investigating the ways that the maternalism of American suffragettes had influenced the seemingly unrelated field of Indian boarding school policy. So when during the second semester of that year I was presented with the opportunity to pursue an independent research project, I took the mandated introduction course, made it through the interview process and was lucky enough to be placed with an amazing mentor, Professor Goeman at UCLA. It was at that point that I began doing more thorough background research in the area I had started to look at the previous summer. In the two years that followed, I was exposed to the work of indigenous scholars I would never have had the opportunity to discover otherwise and learned how demanding yet rewarding the research process can be. Although the hours spent looking through online databases and squinting to read the faded handwriting on old documents were exhausting, finally finding that one source I needed was worth it. I am incredibly fortunate to have been able to enroll in the Honors Research program and thankful for what it has taught me. The program, which I had initially viewed as a way to infuse Native history into my high school curriculum, ended up introducing me to research at a level I never thought I\\'d have access to in high school. This year, I am shifting the focus of my research to the influence of the American Indian boarding school system on the gender relations of tribes in the southeastern U.S., a topic I hope to pursue as an undergraduate.Despite having two biochemistry majors for parents, I\\'d always been hopeless in science class: I broke countless beakers and set my polo on fire during a lab in 10th grade. That changed my junior year in classroom B204: my physics class. I remember learning about centripetal force and being amazed that the same force could affect a car making a sharp turn and control the orbit of a planet. The thought that two distant things in the universe could be connected by a similar force hadn\\'t occurred to me; I\\'d always assumed something like the motion of the planets had to be due to chance. What amazed me, even more, was that ideas that had once been considered scientific certainties could be proven wrong if questioned the right way. For instance, Newtonian physics, which had long been considered a cornerstone of the field, was superseded by relativistic physics in the early 1900s. This newfound passion prompted me to take AP Physics as a senior to further my knowledge. My fascination with physics manifested outside of class in the form of co-founding the S.T.A.R. club with several of my friends so we could spend more time discussing the topics that we didn\\'t have time for in class, like how astronomy and physics were intertwined or how exactly electrons moved to different energy levels. However, this newfound interest wasn\\'t limited to physics. The way physics made me look at the world, with a relentless skepticism and curiosity, made me more willing to question things that I would have blindly accepted at an earlier point, whether that be the play a teammate called during lacrosse or a classmate\\'s interpretation of a quote during English class. Although I\\'m not sure what form it will take, I hope to further my interest in physics in college. Regardless of how I choose to focus my studies, my tendency to question every fact that is presented to me will help me to be a valuable participant in any area of study and in the research opportunities I hope to take advantage of in college. \"}, {\"index\": 109, \"new_personal_statement\": \"A window into the soul.For most people, this would be the eyes. The eyes cannot lie; they often tell more about a person\\'s emotions than their words. What distinguishes a fake smile from a genuine one? The eyes. What shows sadness? The eyes. What gives away a liar? The eyes.But are the eyes the only window into the soul?Recently, I began painting with watercolors. With watercolors, there is no turning back: if one section is too dark, it is nearly impossible to lighten the area again. Every stroke must be done purposefully, every color mixed to its exact value.I laid my materials before me, preparing myself for the worst. I checked my list of supplies, making sure my setup was perfect.I wet my brush, dipped it into some yellow ochre, and dabbed off the excess paint. Too little water on my brush. I dipped my brush back into my trusty water jar; the colors swirled beautifully, forming an abstract art piece before my eyes. \\\\u2014It\\'s a shame that I couldn\\'t appreciate it.I continued mixing colors to their exact value. More alizarin crimson. More water. More yellow ochre. Less water. More phthalo blue. The cycle continued. Eventually, I was satisfied. The colors looked good, there was enough contrast between facial features, and the watercolors stayed inside the lines.Craving feedback, I posted my art to Snapchat. I got a few messages such as \\'wow\\' and \\'pretty,\\' but one message stood out. \\'You were anxious with this one, huh? Anyways, love the hair!\\'I was caught off guard. Was it a lucky guess? Did they know something I didn\\'t? I immediately responded: \\'Haha, how could you tell?\\' No response.What I didn\\'t know at the time was that my response would come a few months later while babysitting. Since the girl I was babysitting loved art, I took out some Crayola watercolors and some watercolor paper for her to play with. After I went to the bathroom and came back, the watercolors were doused with water. \\'You were impatient with this one, huh? Anyways, love the little dog you drew!\\'The little girl looked up at me, confused. \\'How could you tell?\\' \\'You used a lot of water for a brighter color, but you couldn\\'t wait for it to slowly soak in.\\'\\'Oh.\\'Now, I would be lying if I said I realized the connection between the two events immediately.Instead, I made the connection when I decided to sit down one day and objectively critique my art. The piece that I once loved now seemed like a nervous wreck: the paper was overworked, the brushstrokes were undecided, the facial features blended together, and each drop of water was bound inside the lines as if it was a prisoner in a cage.From then on, I started noticing pieces of personality in additional creations surrounding me: website designs, solutions to math problems, code written for class, and even the preparation of a meal.When I peer around at people\\'s projects during Code Club, I notice the clear differences between their code. Some people break it up by commenting in every possible section. Others breeze through the project, not caring to comment or organize their code. I could also see clear differences in personalities when our club members began coding the Arduino for the first time. Some followed the tutorials to the letter, while others immediately started experimenting with different colored LEDs and ways of wiring the circuit.It became clear to me that, as humans, we leave pieces of our souls in everything we do, more than we intend to. If we entertain this thought, perhaps the key to better understanding others around us is simply noticing the subtler clues under our noses?Perhaps there are endless windows to the soul, and we simply need to peer through them. I shakily rose my hand. \\'We should create workshops of our own,\\' I suggested.I got a few strange looks. \\'It\\'s a good idea, but it\\'s too much work.\\' \\'We just don\\'t have enough free time to make it work.\\' \\'Maybe we could, but I don\\'t know how to make workshops.\\' My suggestion was shot down. I shuffled in my seat. \\'I could make them.\\' A few people stared at me in disbelief. I glanced over at the club advisor, Mr. C, nervous to hear his response.\\'If you\\'re willing to take on the work, we can try it.\\' Mr. C replied. And so I embarked on my quest. I researched different workshops on the internet, learning the information myself at first. Then, I transitioned into creating workshops of my own, making sure that the information was easy to understand for even a beginner. I was exhausted; my first workshop took 16 cumulative hours to create. Yet, I didn\\'t realize that my role in the club wouldn\\'t end there. Someone had to lead the workshops, and as the person that made them, I was the only one fit for the role.I walked up to the front of the room, turned on the smartboard, took a deep breath, and greeted the club. \\'Hi everyone! Today I\\'ll be teaching you all the basics of web development.\\' I smiled nervously, waiting for a reaction on the students\\' faces. Nothing. I kept smiling while my hands trembled, and I did my best to finish teaching the workshop. First times are never easy.After a few more times of repeating the routine, I got comfortable running the workshops. Once I proved that my idea of creating our own workshops was viable, other board members started volunteering to help me with the workshops.Now, all of our workshops at Code Club are made by members of the club, something that we\\'re all extremely proud of.Seeing students learn from your hard work is one of the most rewarding feelings I\\'ve ever experienced.How do you encapsulate a person\\'s likeness?Is it a science of lines, forms, and proportions? Or is it something beyond the scope of science: is it just a feeling?I take my pencil to the page, creating lines with great precision. As I make additional strokes to the page, I continuously glance over to the photo sitting next to me.Stroke, erase. Stroke, stroke, stroke, erase. Erase more. The process repeats until I am satisfied with the overall structure.However, this is only the beginning of the process: I have yet to fill in the facial features: the eyes, nose, and mouth. After finishing the drawing portion, I lay out my watercolors before me; this is the part which I enjoy most and the part where I get to showcase my creativity. I have many options to choose from: realistic skin tone, unrealistic skin tone, positive space for the hair, negative space for the hair, white background, colored background, patterned background, neat painting, loose painting\\\\u2026 the possibilities seem endless. I carefully decide what colors and techniques to use in order to bring out the person\\'s likeness. Do they seem like a serious person? Maybe I should be precise with my strokes. Are they a silly, go-with-the-flow type of person? Maybe I should be more loose with my strokes, not caring if I splatter the page. As of recently, painting watercolor portraits isn\\'t my only creative outlet. When I first learned HTML and CSS, I was amazed by the beautiful websites created by people. Immediately, I learned all the CSS I possibly could, aiming to make a beautiful website myself. Now, I enjoy creating different website designs in my spare time and figuring out how to implement them. This process can often take days, or even weeks. When I finally finish writing the code for a visually-appealing website, I take a moment to pause and admire my work. It doesn\\'t take long, however, before I start creating a new one.Watercolor painting and website designing are the two main ways in which I love to showcase my creativity.I stared in awe at the website before me: flashing lights, moving images, audio playing in the background, and a custom cursor. How could I recreate this?I went to Google, hoping for an answer. The first results that popped up were wix.com, blogspot.com, and weebly.com; however, none of them had a template for the type of website I desired. I would have to use code.What is code? How do you use code? How could I get started? I had an idea: the Intro to Java course at the high school.You could imagine my disappointment once I realized we weren\\'t creating websites. However, I kept taking the class.Each project was a mini-puzzle, a problem waiting to be solved. Except, unlike the traditional puzzles I did when I was little, the results did more than look pretty. We created projects with a purpose: hangman, madlibs, calculators, and interactive stories; the possibilities seemed endless. My teacher at the time, Mrs. DiPietro, saw my interest in the class and pushed me into the world of computer science. When I finished projects early, she would let me go around the room and help others with their projects. If I needed help, she would let me stay after school.Her support, however, didn\\'t end there: she encouraged me to take more computer science courses. When I left her class, she encouraged me from behind the scenes, telling me about women-specific opportunities such as Built By Girls, Girls Who Code, and Kode with Klossy. Apart from the opportunities Mrs. DiPietro gave to me, I\\'ve created my own opportunities. Every week, I create workshops for our school\\'s Code Club, curating a curriculum in HTML and CSS that someone with no coding background can understand.Every month, I volunteer at the Bryant Library to teach middle schoolers the basics of coding through Scratch Jr.Currently, I\\'m also part of an organizing team for a hackathon that took place on September 29th and will also take place in the fall.I have no doubt that I want to continue studying computer science when I enter college. I silently watched the kid as he got out of his chair and danced in front of the class. \\'Oh no,\\' another counselor cried out. The face of the teacher turned red with anger. \\'Sarah, take him for a walk. Now.\\' I immediately obliged. When we got to the hallway, I asked the kid, \\'Why did you do that?\\'\\'I was bored,\\' he replied. \\'You couldn\\'t wait until gym?\\'\\'Nope.\\'This repeated many times: the kid would get out of his seat, disrupt class, and I would take him for a walk.\\'Why do you find class boring?\\' I asked him one day.\\'We don\\'t do anything. We just sit there and listen.\\'\\'What would you want to do in class, then?\\'\\'I dunno, read books, watch movies, and play games?\\' \\'Huh.\\'When walking to lunch later in the day, I pulled aside the teacher. \\'Excuse me, but do you think I could help you plan the lessons from now on?\\' I asked nervously. \\'Really? That would be great!\\'From then on, I did my best to suggest ways to make the class more fun: games like 24, puzzles like sudoku and kenken, and documentaries on topics that we were currently talking about in class.Seeing the excitement on the kids\\' faces when we first started playing games is a moment I\\'ll never forget. They squealed and bet with their friends on who would win. This was a moment that convinced me that maybe I could make a difference in the summer experience. However, I knew that I could do more to help these kids.During the day, I would come over to students individually, ask them if they needed help, crack a few jokes, and leave them be. During lunch, (when I wasn\\'t helping the teacher with lesson plans), I would make an active effort to sit with people who looked lonely. When the kid that I used to walk in the hallway said his thanks to me at the end of summer school, I knew I had achieved what I set out to do.\"}, {\"index\": 110, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I live in two different worlds.One is the world of Newton and Galileo, of Calculus and Physics, of molecules and hydrogen bonds, of differential equations and integrals--the objective realm.

The Grand Canyon\\'s colors are a collection of light energy interacting with the molecules of the rocks, eventually reflecting to the retina and processed as an image by the occipital lobe.Emotion is simply the work of neurotransmitters.

Thank your limbic system for the waterworks.The universe isn\\'t nearly that straightforward, though. That\\'s where the second world comes into play.This is the world of Shakespeare and Hemingway, of love and fear, of Dickens and Dickinson, of poetry and prose--the subjective sphere. This world explains why we do crazy things for love, why your heart swells after reading Of Mice and Men and why you buy an HBO subscription just to watch Game of Thrones.In this world, a Beethoven symphony is eloquent, sound waves aside. The Grand Canyon is a thing of beauty, regardless of light energy.I am torn between these two schools of thought, day in and day out. I love the order of a physics equation and the logic of calculus. At the same time, the cold reasoning of science did not console my broken heart after my girlfriend broke up with me, A Farewell to Arms did.I\\'ve explored both science and the humanities. My poetry and writing won numerous Scholastic Arts awards; I scored an 800 on my Math II subject test and a 36 on ACT math. By the end of high school, I\\'ll have taken nearly equal numbers of AP classes in the humanities and in STEM (five and six, respectively). Outside of the classroom, I read Don Quixote for fun, and then I read The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, a book about clinical neurology, for fun. I helped found my school\\'s political union; I am also a proud member of my school\\'s varsity math team. On Tuesdays, I volunteer as a writing mentor for my peers. On Thursdays, I tutor underprivileged kids in math.I oftentimes feel torn between the subjective and the objective. Am I like Switzerland, refusing to choose a side? At worst, I am a double agent. At best, I am a Renaissance man.I can see two parallel futures playing out. In one, I am a professor of classical literature, giving lectures about Dostoevsky and Steinbeck in a pair of tortoiseshell glasses. In the other, I am a neurologist, reading an EEG in a white lab coat. Maybe my future isn\\'t completely binary. One of my inspirations, Dr. Paul Kalanithi, bridged the gap between these two dissonant worlds. Though his life was cut short by cancer, he managed to be both a leading neurosurgeon and a prominent writer, a graduate of Stanford Med and a New York Times bestselling author.To be honest, I\\'m not sure where I will be in four years. I could say I\\'m leaning towards neurobiology, but I\\'m not going to declare a major. Instead, I\\'m simply going to declare a thirst to learn and an eagerness to further explore both the worlds of science and the humanities. \"}, {\"index\": 111, \"new_personal_statement\": \"When I was born 9 weeks early and two pounds lighter than average, the only family present was my mom. And that\\'s how it has always been, in our small family with the same makeup as a hydrogen atom \\\\u2013 a mother nucleus and daughter electron. My childhood was one filled with exploration, in our tiny apartment overflowing with books. My mom helped me go at my own pace, so I read chapter books at 3\\\\u00bd. Questions, no matter how strange, were permitted and encouraged, leading me to sit in the bathroom at eight reading the Economist, calling out down the hall asking who this person was, what this word meant, because I refused to wait until I was done. New books were constantly appearing, so new questions always arose. I thought my mother was an endless vessel of information, and was shocked when she didn\\'t contain the answer I wanted. But I loved when we subsequently crowded around a computer screen, or scoured the local library for the answer, where my little fingers would write it down in the \\'Question Notebook\\' we had purchased because I loved its cover of cats. Now, more bookshelves line the tiny apartment. Old favourites have been packed away in boxes and put in storage. But for me the world keeps expanding with facts and possibilities. The Economist is still read, but understood more. Wired and Scientific American have joined it. Now, as I learn things, I search for connections. Reading about technology has led to coding courses, fashion to sewing courses, and political affairs to Model United Nations. Now my mother comes to me with questions.Home has become a kind of constitutional monarchy \\\\u2013 the Momarch has the final word, but democracy exists, for efficiency\\'s sake. Disagreements are rare. There is no alternative but communication. There is no other parent for me to run to, no sibling to support my side of the argument, only the judge and the defendant self-representing. We talk. Sure, there are still typical teen-parent spats, with \\'you don\\'t get it!\\' and \\'put your phone down right now!\\' But mostly, it is a peaceful existence, a unity of parasitism and mutualism in one place, the electron orbiting the nucleus.It will not be long before everything changes. The small apartment will be much quieter. The orbiting daughter electron will become a free electron, and the nucleus will be alone; the end of hydrogen. To the nucleus, it will quickly become too quiet. There will be no one to drive around, to tell her about Star Wars theories, about what the 9th graders did this time, about what book she has to read. And the free electron? For the first little while, she\\'ll enjoy being Riannon-the-university-student, going to bed when she wants to, buying and eating an entire cake if she feels like it. Missing mom won\\'t arrive until the 3rd week at the earliest, depending on how much we talk. Initially, she\\'ll be the one calling, ensuring I\\'m arriving to class on time, that I\\'m not eating just bread for lunch because I don\\'t want to cook. But then I\\'ll be calling her. No one will yet be able to understand my light-speed rate of speaking. I won\\'t know who will likely know the answer to strange questions on-the-go, who probably knows what the word on the tip of my tongue is. And I\\'ll realize, I miss her. But, I\\'ll be okay. I know how to be on my own. I know my mother fostered my creative and knowledge-seeking spirit; my search for knowledge will be lifelong. I won\\'t be limited by the extent of my experiences, but made stronger by them. All those books about the adventures of others let me know it is my turn.

This is a drum major uniform, meant to set me apart from the rest of the marching band as I conduct them. I practice a few gestures; a crescendo, a cutoff, enjoying the feeling of the grey fabric, reveling in the wide-eyed stares of freshmen, knowing that soon all attention will be on me as I control the music with motions of my white-gloved hands. Brimming with pride, I cannot wait to perform. Three months later, I stand in the award ceremony at the end of the band season, reeling as someone asks if my gloves are meant to be grey. They used to be white, I whisper as my heart drops into my stomach, and I turn my hands over and over, comparing them to the clean, crisp grey of my uniform jacket, criticizing the creases, the stretched and broken seams, the holes patched with tape, the worked-in brown smudges, the black grease marks, the sweat stains, the tiny drips of blood that all smear together into a tainted, disgraceful grey. But, looking closer, I realize that the hole on my thumb was ripped while unloading marimbas and drums. The brown dirt worked into the fingertips is the dirt of Littleton, Colorado, where I folded up and pinned every band member\\'s pant legs to proper length. The black smears are grease from the props, where I perfected the angle right before the show started. The seams are stretched from helping a freshman up after he tripped. And the grey, grey dust is from the parking lot just outside this stadium, where I picked up the hundred water bottles I handed to band members - taking one for myself only after everyone else - and carried the trash half a mile to a dumpster. I am a leader, set apart in grey, but the grey of my gloves is a different grey than that of my uniform. My uniform is a flat hue purchased with donated dollars. My gloves are a patina of black, brown, white, and grey, a color bought with sweat and service. I love this stinky, sweaty grey. I have loved every second I spent earning it. The laughter shared while I fixed comically long pants, the self deprecating smile of the clumsy freshman (and the relief in his eyes when we laughed it off together), the grateful nods of band members when I handed them a water bottle: I would not sacrifice a moment to have a pair of clean gloves. A thousand tiny moments of my season, of my community, of my band family, of my love, of my life, are woven into the very fabric on my hands.I have grown into the uniform and the position as it has molded to me. Though I do enjoy the showmanship that comes with my position, I love to see my band strive and succeed, and I am most grateful for the chance to help them in any way that I can. My leadership is not about the attention I receive; it is about the passion in the performance, the devotion to the art, the fervent humanity of the people. To lead is to give, so I give everything that I can to them. In the final award ceremony, our band is called, and I step forward and salute the stadium. I do not salute because I am proud of what I have done; I salute for my friends, for my band, for the hard work and dedication they have poured forth. And I salute with grey-gloved fingertips.  \\'I thought you were just white,\\' my classmate declares when I show him a picture of my family: white father, Chinese mother, and two children somewhere in the racial middle. And yet a few weeks later, the same classmate derides the A on my geometry test, \\'It\\'s only because you\\'re \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Asian,\\'\\' he hisses as he flips his paper over to hide his grade and his racism. I have been assigned two mutually exclusive stereotypes: I am a collector of stereotypes, and I must exist within these contradictory roles. I am not \\'just white,\\' but it certainly seems that way. Born in America, I\\'ve known only the white suburbs of Ann Arbor and Denver. When people look at me, the first thing they see is the paleness of my skin. And I ache. I am half white American, half Chinese, but the world wishes only to see my whiteness. In particular, I struggle with the word \\'just.\\' My whiteness is not untrue; in culture and in color I am quite white. But I look at my Chinese mother, smell the rice porridge permeating the walls of our home, and know that this cannot be my whole truth. I have come to realize that my Asian heritage, while bestowed upon me freely, cannot be realized without my effort. I choose Chinese over Latin despite everyone\\'s advice, I search my reflection for the hints of Chinese in my face, finding solace in my low nose and almost-monolids, I write my middle name over and over until I find beauty in its curves and sharp corners, until \\\\u4f69\\\\u5a77 stops meaning a collection of Chinese sounds and starts meaning me. I make an effort to protect that part of myself, the part of me that would be smudged away by those who see \\'just white,\\' because now I cannot afford to lose that part of my identity. Now, I do more than simply exist in an awkward halfness: I love the beauty of being mixed. I revel in about how my Asian mother made me take off my shoes off but my dad couldn\\'t care less, or how the Asian side of the family always made the best food except on Thanksgiving (on Thanksgiving I want American turkey). Each element of my existence is incomplete without the other, so the dichotomy is essential to my identity. Since I have come to accept my own complex place in society, I want to share that with others. Everyone, no matter their racial background, has had the experience of not quite belonging to one group or another, so I want to build a community that recognizes the complicated nature of identity, racial and otherwise. And I want this community to do more than recognize it: I want to celebrate the complexity of an interconnected society that begets an uncompartmentalizable identity. For as I have learned that nuance makes identity valuable and unique, I have learned that being half makes me whole.\"}, {\"index\": 113, \"new_personal_statement\": \"A large part of my life was a complete lie to most people I knew until I reached high school. \\'So, whose house am I dropping you off at?\\'The harmless question invited a sharp pang of anxiety in my stomach that came every time someone asked me about my family. This time, I was 12, and my friend\\'s dad was driving us home from a bat mitzvah in Coney Island.Without lifting my firm gaze from the floor of the car, I shakily explained that it was my mom\\'s house; my parents were divorced and my brother lived in Philadelphia with my dad and his wife. This was far from the truth, and I hoped that my voice wouldn\\'t betray me. The familiar, agonizing guilt settled in. I quickly reassured myself that I would never have to see this father again, that the guilt was better than facing the dreadful reaction I had conjured up in my head. When I lied similarly to close friends, I knew it was wrong. But, I felt protected.In reality, I was raised by five gay parents: my mom, two dads, and two other moms. They have filled my life with nonstop support and an admiration of all things unconventional, something I took for granted. At seven, I perched on my dad\\'s shoulders at a pride parade in D.C., eagerly looking out at a sea of rainbow flags in the hands of impassioned queer people and feeling a surge of delirium that I had never experienced before. At 11, I witnessed my moms crying and shouting \\'We won!!\\' the day New York State passed the marriage equality law. These moments were miraculous to me, but I trapped them inside.Growing up, I felt painfully abnormal. My moms and dads encouraged me to bravely explore the Barbie section at Target and celebrated that I wanted to dress up as Snow White on Halloween; they never questioned why I didn\\'t hang out with other boys. But, as I got older, peers started to point out these trivial differences, taunting me about my feminine mannerisms and my unapologetic joy. I developed an internalized homophobia that deeply influenced my perception of my family and myself. I did not want people to know about my parents because I thought it would reveal that I was gay, something I deemed the epitome of otherness.As I slowly grasped what it did to me, my interaction with this hidden part of my identity, my avoidance of who I truly was, has propelled me to care deeply about my communities. Now, as a 17 year old, I have grown to reject shame and embrace pride.I am drawn to people who are authentically and proudly themselves. I find solace in interacting with different groups at school\\\\u2014Rainbow Club, Diversity Initiative, Bollywood Club\\\\u2014formed by people who are proud of their identities and want to share them. They taught me to do the same. I am involved with the DI because I want to help create the inclusive and supportive community at my school that I lacked before.Outside of school, I harness the power of images to further express internalized facets of my self. The spring of my junior year, I spent numerous hours a week in the International Center of Photography\\'s color darkroom, printing portraits of my parents. For the final exhibition of my photo intensive, I put them and the courage I\\'ve gained on display, exploring my family\\'s construct and my identity. This meaningful, personal endeavor represented four years of self-directed change.My understanding of my personal truth is in flux. Yet, calibrating these two sides of my life has yielded a newfound self-liberation, enabling me to act, speak, and live empathetically.

Thanks to my mother\\'s devotion, he eventually showed great progress in walking, but then he was diagnosed with epilepsy. My father began to consume alcohol and abuse my mother, leading to their divorce. When that was over, my sister was diagnosed with rheumatism and my mother with sciatica, bringing sleepless nights and uncountable visits to the hospital. In turn, my other sister developed depression and even attempted suicide. Following that, my older brother became addicted to drugs. My eldest brother, despite graduating from college, is unemployed with no intention of getting a job, and my mother cried on a near daily basis.As you can imagine, those times were a disaster. To be honest, even I do not know precisely how I made it through. I know however, that whenever I considered giving up, my mother\\'s face popped into my head. She needed me and looked to me hopefully to achieve what my other siblings did not, like getting into a prestigious college, graduating, being a productive part of society, and a pillar supporting our family.My upbringing developed a peculiar mix of pessimism and optimism in my character. I became addicted to inspirational quotes and comedy shows, both of which brought me solace. In middle school, I discovered Anime, which was the source of a quote I cherished very much. I still remember that quote: \\'You can\\'t live because you are not strong? Wrong! Only living shows your strength.\\' That quote, coupled with my mother\\'s image in my head were what propelled me forward, and propel me it did.I remember at 5 when my brother was diagnosed with epilepsy, how I had to adapt to the sight of my twin brother getting seizures, how I learned determination and compassion out of my mother\\'s dedication to teaching him, and how I started sketching to play with him. I remember at 11 when my mother was first diagnosed with sciatica, how I had to take over and handle cooking and cleaning, how I learned that you should never look at onions when you cut them, and not use too much dish soap or bubbles will come out of the sink. I remember at 13 when my sister was diagnosed with rheumatism, how I had to learn how to administer physical therapy, and occasionally, how to braid someone\\'s hair for her. I remember at 15 when my other sister showed signs of depression and even attempted suicide, how I taught her sketching to express her feelings, how she in turn taught me basic knitting, and how we both collaborated to make a dress as a gift for my mother.Fortunately, my life is not a roller coaster anymore. My mother and sister are doing great through physical therapy. My dad stopped consuming alcohol and I am actually currently living with him. My other sister and older brother are doing great through therapy. In fact, both are currently pursuing degrees in humanities, and my twin brother, despite his impairments, became the top student in his graduating class.Despite the darkness of those times, I don\\'t regret experiencing them. For only darkness lets you see light, and instead of remaining in darkness, I became a light that shone on my family.How do you start solving a science/math problem?Most might suggest writing variables or equations, citing units, and all that jazz. But me, being a rebel, choose to sketch a diagram. Funny how that physics and math, epitomes of experimental sciences, actually incorporated some artistic qualities to me.It all started when I was 5; I was sad on my first day at preschool and missing my mother. But when the arts period came, this sadness faded away. My first ever sketch was the cliche portrait of me, my brother, sister, and mother who was raising us on her own. This infatuation morphed into a passion, and sketching became my main hobby. At 10, I used to sketch in the sand pit at the park, and one time a crowd of people were all watching me sketch and cheering me on. Reading this essay might make you think I am a person more suited to the arts, and indeed, my main objective as a child was to grow up and become an artist. However, I found another source of passion growing up: the sciences. Everything from biology to math and physics intrigued me. Thanks to my hobby of sketching, I found geometry to be my favorite branch of math, a big reason why I started to consider pursuing engineering (fun fact, the word for \\'engineering\\' in Arabic is a synonym for \\'geometry\\').Engineering involved all my favorite elements: design, mathematics, and science. Some people express their creative side through writing or music, but I express mine by sketching mathematical and physics equations and problems.Hard pages, fresh ink odor, those were the characteristics of my 12th birthday gift. Throughout childhood, I was infatuated with science. Thinking back, I don\\'t quite remember how this infatuation came about. Was it my obsession with sci-fi films and TV shows? The reverence I somehow held in regards to scientists? I don\\'t know but my entire family knew of this infatuation. For that I got the 600 pages Science Encyclopedia as my birthday present.I spent the following days unraveling the different topics in this book, from the creation of radio to the development of volcanoes to the subtle differences between physics and math. I loved it. As simple as it was, I still consider that as the best birthday present to this day.That experience sparked an interest in me for reading science books, enough that I devoured the entire science section of my middle school\\'s library. This interest further morphed into something more. High school marked my transition from sheer reading to experimental sciences. The thought of wearing lab coats and doing experiments excited me, but to my disappointment, those were scarcely offered in my humble school. I had to find alternatives to quench this thirst for experimental science. That is why I started pursuing summer programs. I chose to take chemistry in my program at Harvard for the sole reason of their emphasis on lab work, I did the Future Doctors Program at King Saud University for the same reason, from developing electro-chemical powered car models to my experiments with microbiology and biochemistry. I further fell into this pit of experimental science. I am thrilled to explore the University of California\\'s advanced labs. I am particularly interested in chemical engineering and renewable energy, and would be honored to work with the distinguished faculty in there.Throughout high school I felt privileged to be bilingual in Arabic and English. While I used this knowledge to help my classmates with homework and such, I never really applied it on a large scale. That was, until my senior year in high school when I was approached by my teacher to become the main translator for the Afaaq Academic Future Program, which aims to introduce students to the different majors and courses at King Saud University.The position required me to stand in front of a large audience beside foreign faculty and translate their lectures. It was nerve wrecking to say the least. I barely presented in class. However, something made me feel at home in the college environment. I believe that was the excitement of learning new information, especially since they were STEM focused, and translating it for my classmates. That experience not only helped me hone my presentation skills, it also inspired my classmates to consider different majors they hadn\\'t before. My friend Alaa in particular, was aiming to major in medicine but was astonished to find out that pharmaceutics was a much better fit for him since he did not like anatomy. I also was guilty of such biases. I was so focused on mechanical engineering that I completely overlooked other branches of the field, but thankfully, I discovered the wondrous world of chemical engineering. I had only known a little about chemical engineering and was astonished to find the many different applications it had, namely renewable energy and sustainability.While I am proud of my efforts in the Afaaq Academic Future Program, I am aware that they were not nearly enough to help all my fellow classmates decide on a major. That is why I am still in touch with my teacher and plan to continue providing support to students, not only from my high school, but all over Saudi Arabia, and who knows, maybe this can extend to California and U.S. students or a wider community of international students here.Some people might say college would be their biggest challenge, but I say, bring it on! I have faced plenty of challenges, and I am not afraid.Despite being born to an upper middle-class family, we faced our fair share of setbacks. It got to the point where I started to wonder if I were somehow transported into a soap opera. Each time things started getting brighter, darkness struck out of nowhere.My twin brother was born with serious birth defects, one which cost him the ability to control his nerves. After showing great progress in walking and talking, he was diagnosed with epilepsy, which propelled my father to consume alcohol and start abusing my mother, leading to their divorce. When that was over, my sister got diagnosed with rheumatism and my mother with sciatica. Following that were uncountable visits to the hospital and sleepless nights. In turn, my other sister developed depression and even attempted suicide. After that, my older brother became addicted to drugs and almost abused my sisters.Fortunately, those nightmares are over. My mother and sister are going through physical therapy and their symptoms are improving. My other sister and brother started pursuing therapy and are now doing great; in fact, both are currently pursuing degrees in the humanities. Despite the harshness of those experiences, I did not leave them empty-handed. My twin brother\\'s disability taught me responsibility, compassion, and how to cook. My mother and sister\\'s illnesses made me learn how to provide therapeutic massages, and occasionally, how to braid someone\\'s hair. My other sister\\'s depression taught me how to provide emotional support and patience. But those experiences taught something even more important, only darkness lets you see light, and instead of becoming an empty presence in darkness I became light.Why is my brother so different from me, even though we are twins?That question haunted me at five years old. I came home from school each day to the typical sight of my twin brother playing silently on the floor with his toys. One time, however, he was not alone. Behind him stood my mother with an expression of heartbreak and anguish on her face, tears dripping down her cheeks. I confronted her the following morning. After some hesitation, she finally gave me the full story. She told me that while I came into the world easily, my brother was not as lucky.He was stuck inside the womb for 15 minutes, and those mere 15 minutes would change his life forever. The lack of oxygen during that time damaged his brain cells, specifically, the part of the brain responsible for physical growth. Doctors said he would not develop past the age of 5 at best.After hearing my mom\\'s story, I felt a sense of responsibility. I was the older brother, after all (even if by 15 minutes), and, I had not done enough to help him. I ended up deciding that he should go to preschool with me. Preschool, although annoying with the need to get up early in the morning, proved to be quite fun for me. It had colorful walls and small classes where we would sit down on the carpet to draw and play. The arts period was my personal favorite and I thought my brother would like it too.That day in preschool was one of my favorites. Despite my brother having difficulty communicating with others, we still had lots of fun. I ended up drawing the cliche family portrait of my mother, my brother, my sister, and me. My brother mimicked me and we both laughed about it.While my feelings toward my brother started out as empathy and responsibility, they evolved to sheer admiration as we got older. My mother took initiative and started teaching my brother to talk. At first it seemed pointless, but little by little my brother started talking, enough to even baffle the doctors at his annual examination. After that came the next stage of teaching him math and science, in which I played a part.A sense of responsibility followed me through the years. At 9, when I learned to cook basic meals, I always made extra for him. At 11, when I started my hobby of reading science books, I offered to read with him. He similarly loved playing console games and shared all his favorites with me. I remember the casual chatter we had every day after coming home from school and the satisfaction that ensued after finishing our homework.Are people just born smart? I\\'ve had this question in my mind for a while. It would not have been for my brother that I realized its answer. My brother, despite all his impairments, is now the top student in his 12th-grade class. Because he was born smart? No. Rather it was because the education he received unleashed his hidden potential. Much like what I am trying to do today and right now. Who knew we were so similar after all?\"}, {\"index\": 115, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Saturday 26th May 2001, I became a part of this world. My thoughts on how I crippled out my mother\\'s womb, sobbed like every regular infants would and put a jaunty smile on my face when taking in my first breast milk are just fantasies. I guess I was filled with exhilaration that made me not to realise I wasn\\'t bore on a silver spoon.On fateful september 2001, a tribal clash between the Northerners and other regions in Nigeria arose. A crisis that led to loss of hundreds-thousands of lives and properties. Unfortunately, my family were victims. My cousin\\'s two fingers with cut, my brother was given deep cuts in his left hand, our shop and all the properties we had were lost. After the paltry experience, we were left with no other choice than to leave for the village. This was doing us no good, my parents arranged to take us to the city. At the city, my father became a petite carpenter and my mother hawked just to cater for the family. My siblings had stopped school because my parents ain\\'t able to pay the fees. By God\\'s grace, my mother had gotten a shop so she had quit hawking. My father\\'s carpentry work wasn\\'t earning him enough which made him became a bike rider. I couldn\\'t bear seeing my father ride a motorbike for an income, but what could I do? I was still a lad. One day I was back from school, I saw my father covered with fatal injuries, bruises and deep cuts. Before asking what had happened, I cried so bitterly. What happened I asked with a croaky voice. He had a road accident. Most times when life is hopeless, you\\'ve got to create one for yourself. Due to the gruelling trials my dad has passed through, he became really pale of illness I still don\\'t know about. Some doctors would say stress, some said hypertension, diabetes, stroke and so on. My siblings and mum did all their best to gather some money and even seeked for public assistance to help treat his retarded health. Obnoxiously it got worser, he became paralysed. We had to take him from one place to another(even to use the restroom). He could seldom talk or even move his body. I never thought I would lose someone loving to me until an indelible day arrived. It was a sunny Thursday\"}, {\"index\": 116, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I will never forget the rush of satisfaction and success as I broke through the tape of the finish line at the acclaimed Simplot Games in Pocatello, Idaho. After stumbling off the track, doubled over and panting, my relay teammates rushed toward me, grabbing my hands and pulling me up, shouting, \\'we won, we won!\\' I will never forget my heart sinking to my toes faster than I could ever sprint as I caught view of the big screen flashing \\'Niwot \\\\u2013 disqualified.\\' I was in utter disbelief. I had just anchored a Colorado State Track and Field Championship 4x200m relay that should\\'ve placed third, and somehow my teammates and I were walking off the infield with nothing to show for our months of hard work. Gazing at my laptop, I felt torn about which of the preceding paragraphs was the better introduction to my college essay. Then I suddenly realized: Each story is equally as valuable. Both moments shaped me more than I could\\'ve guessed. I never would have stood atop the national-level podium during February in Pocatello if I hadn\\'t sat on the sidewalk and cried over a state meet disqualification nine months earlier. That failure lit a fire in me. Success in athletics has always come naturally to me, but the state relay disqualification was a slap in the face that I had become complacent. Failure sparked a drive and determination that allowed me to totally change my work ethic and focus on achieving my lofty goals. I learned that neither my failures nor my successes in my sport make me who I am, but rather, the unique combination of both defeat and achievement has caused immense personal growth in all areas of my life.In spite of the many, many successes and failures, what sticks out most to me is how much track and field has radically transformed my sense of self. Before track, I didn\\'t like being the one in charge. I have become comfortable directing a large group of peers during practice and meets, and I embrace my role as a leader. Before track, I didn\\'t mentally prepare for competition. I have learned the importance of goal setting, visualizing success, and having faith in myself. Before track, I would worry about how the competition might be better or stronger or faster than me. I have learned that the only things I can control are my work ethic, my attitude, and my effort. Before track, I dreaded getting called out for my mistakes. I have learned how to embrace criticism and how to handle getting yelled at. Before track, failure was crushing. I have learned how to deal with falling short. Before track, I didn\\'t have an appreciation for those I compete with and against. I have cultivated a genuine compassion for every athlete around me on the track or in the jump pit, as well as my classmates, teachers, coworkers, and even strangers. These transformations didn\\'t happen overnight. It took three years of my coach pushing me out of my comfort zone again and again for me to foster leadership, compassion, work ethic, and grit, and I continue to develop these qualities today. Track and field has given me endless gifts. I love that the effort and passion I put forth is paid back tenfold by this sport. I see results not just in times and distances, but also in all other aspects of my life \\\\u2013 how I eat and sleep, how I focus in school, how I hold myself with confidence, and how I treat others. I am so grateful that track has shaped my high school experience and opened up so many opportunities for my future. Even more powerful than my love of the sport itself is the happiness and pride I feel when I realize the overwhelming positive impact track and field has made on the person I am becoming.\"}, {\"index\": 117, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The Prime-ary Challenge\\'You will finish your classes later today,\\' announced my teacher as we heard the sound of sirens that pulled us to the windows.\\'Must be an official, has such a huge escort,\\' said my classmate, adding a flavor of curiosity to our perplexed emotions. To soothe the atmosphere, I added, \\'Yeah, one wrong word against them, they\\'ll take you away.\\' This is a common Armenian saying, forged during the dictatorial Soviet era that succeeded in oppressing the public opinion and eliminating free discourse so fundamentally that my joke still bore a spoonful of actuality.Asked to take our seats, we learned the identity of our guest only after he entered our classroom. An instant wave of surprise and discomfort made me feel the possible imminence of my conversation with him\\\\uff0dwith someone whose political views and those of mine are at odds\\\\uff0dwith the Prime Minister of Armenia. Luckily, my principal started presenting our school. But when we were asked to give questions to the Prime Minister, our teacher broke the proceeding unpleasant silence, \\'Mr. Prime Minister, we would like to know what the current situation on the Karabakh-Azerbaijani border is.\\' The Prime Minister reasserted of the relative calmness on the border, adding, \\'The new powerful weaponry from our primary ally, Russia, ensures strengthened security and...\\'An electric shock immediately passed through my body and evoked my fresh memories about the devastating war in April 2016 in Nagorno Karabakh where our \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018ally\\' has been actively intervening. And on top of this, Armenia\\'s (forceful?) joining an economic union, ruled by \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018our ally\\' and favored by the Prime Minister, underscores the cynicism of our political reality. But despite my desire to speak up, my inner voice bombarded me with questions: \\'Should I discard my own opinion? Should I counter the Prime Minister?\\' The Armenian joke revisited me, this time however not generating laughter, rather anger towards myself and others reluctant to voice their opinions. This made me overcome dubiety and act. I raised my hand.The Prime Minister stopped to take my question. \\'Mr. Prime Minister, but don\\'t you think we should reconsider our relations with Russia? For many years this country triggers war by supplying weaponry to both belligerent states, instead of being the pacifist liaison between the two. Would it not be fallacious to call that country our ally?\\'I was relieved. I challenged the Prime Minister\\'s and his supporters\\' views, but above all, myself and the Armenian identity that had been indoctrinated to unwaveringly accept ideas from \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018above\\'. Well, breaking the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018wall\\' certainly hurt. Yet upon realizing I stepped outside the box, I felt empowered, shouting to let the world know it is possible, albeit some \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018glances of disapproval\\'. One belonged to my principal who whispered to my teacher, \\'Does this kid know who he is talking to?\\'The Prime Minister\\'s answer proved me more. Listing several advantages of reinforcing our ties with Russia, some solid though not mind-altering, he concluded, \\'In any case, this is our only way.\\' This was when I realized that the Prime Minister conceded: we appeared on the same ground, one of discussion and mutual understanding. Looking back, I understand how powerful debate is and realize that I also challenged those who discourage political divergence and mock the opposition for \\'wasting time\\' confronting the government, thinking nothing can be reached, anyway. Well, they say when two things crash, both suffer. However, when two opposing ideas do, we see them collide, intertwine, spiral, and blossom. And it is beautiful to see how both benefit from the interchange of ideas and reach a compromise. Although my little chat with the Prime Minister was not an exemplar of a debate, it did prove eye-opening to me. They didn\\'t take me away\\\\u2026 I had a powerful weapon\\\\u2026 my willingness to discuss. Apparently, the Armenian joke lost its actuality.Having been exposed to the Armenian education system, based on traditional Soviet teaching methodologies and academic content, for many years, I only received extensive and deep theoretical knowledge but lacked practicality. Entering the IB Diploma Programme, however, opened a new door for me full of new kind of educational adventures and academic opportunities.Never having had an experience of actually applying my theoretical knowledge into the real life, I was granted with the opportunity to conduct a deep research in Economics as part of the core component of the programme, the 4000-word-long Extended Essay. In the framework of the latter, I explored the effect of the fall of the global oil price in 2014 on the money inflow from Russia to Armenia. In fact, I introduced an alternative to the widespread opinion that Armenia\\'s joining the Eurasian Economic Union was the most important reason behind the diminishing money inflow. The mere fact that I was able to weave my theoretical knowledge with the real-world phenomena and incorporate quantitative analysis into my research made me appreciate and feel the usefulness of the knowledge I gained in the programme. On top of this, the fact that I was able to challenge a popular opinion with my not widely discussed and previously not explored argument proved me that the programme could teach me to be an independent thinker and researcher who is able to make his small scientific contribution to the field he is passionate about.In addition to this, the programme also allowed me to further deepen my knowledge in Computer Science and turn it into a useful outcome through the application of my algorithmic thinking. Particularly, as part of my Computer Science course, I have created a computer programme that automatically creates the timetable of the subjects for each IB student which has so far every year been done manually and which has till now caused hardships to the school. Thus the opportunities that the IB programme provided me with allowed me to experience the power of the knowledge and enabled me to make practical contributions in what I love studying. Practising chess has shaped how I think and behave. It made me adopt the game\\'s mentality and has developed in me the skill of \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018chess thinking\\' based on several principles.Chess is all about calculations, which has come to shape how I perceive my own life. Every move in chess should be priorly assessed by considering the possible countermoves your opponent might respond with and all the probable continuations. This thinking has developed into a skill I use when dealing with challenges, even minor ones, like asking a question or starting a conversation. Every time before doing so I try to think of the possible answers I could receive and prepare responses to them, to be 3-4 steps ahead, just like in chess\\\\u2014prepared for any course of events.Besides, chess has made me take the \\'touch-move\\' rule seriously even in the reality. In chess, after touching a figure you cannot play with another. This rule clearly describes my nature of working that is driven by chess thinking. I always start my work only when I am sure that what I do will not change at the end. Even when working on this essay I spent several weeks on planning before starting the writing process since I refused to write my ideas immediately; I knew they would change. Hence, my chess thinking forces me to reach a perfect (for me, of course) notion of my outcome.But the most important component of my chess thinking skill that developed recently is challenging my own potential move by placing myself in another person\\'s shoes. In doing so, I think critically, understanding what the weaknesses of my move are and, what the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018opponent\\' can \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018play\\' in response. Constructive criticism is indeed a powerful tool for achieving improvement, but it is even stronger when directed toward yourself. Due to my chess thinking I never accept my initial ideas blindfoldedly, trying to analyze them by raising counterideas. Eventually, I create \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018perfected\\' knowledge which would be inaccessible to me were this skill not present. Thus, chess thinking is a fundamental skill of mine that I really value.There came a time when I had the desire to make a change in others the way the international programme I was studying in and the extracurricular activities I was involved in positively altered me as a person. This was when I decided to establish a TED-Ed Club at our school certified by TED, where students could discuss their ideas on topics of global significance and enhance their public speaking skills.At first, I viewed the club as a means of raising the awareness of students on a variety of topics. But besides focusing on the content of the club, I came to understand the importance of observing the interaction within the team and the role of the team leader in providing implicit psychological assistance to the team members. Due to this I could identify the barriers that hindered the comfort of some members who were timid to voice their opinion, and by encouraging them, achieved the creation of a true team where every individual freely contributes to group efforts.Among these achievements we recorded in the club, there was one I was extremely proud of. When the time came for the participants to create TED-style talks, one of the members wrote a message telling that she wants to quit the club because she was afraid of public speaking. During two hours of conversation I explained to her that her fears are baseless and that psychological barriers do not exist for themselves but are rather created by ourselves; hence, they can be destroyed by ourselves, too. To my delight, I could convince her to break through the barrier and do public speaking.I felt even a greater sense of pride and achievement when, she, after completing her club activity decided to run for a president of the Student Council, which involves campaigning and talking in front of the whole student body. This was a moment I would remember for a lifetime as I was able to change the course of and play a positive role in one\\'s life which was what I was dreaming of when becoming a club leader.Having studied at my school for seven years, I have always been eager to contribute to my school community and satisfied this desire by being socially active. This year, however, I made a much larger impact by being the President of Shirakatsy Parliament, a student-led body with nearly 70 members, aimed at discussing and finding solutions to the school problems.My first step toward making a positive change was identifying the problems present at our school and the creation of respective topics based on those to be discussed by the committees, the working groups, of the parliament. The topics included the poor involvement of students in voluntary pursuits, the absence of coordination of student-led clubs, and, most importantly, the insufficient impact of the school in its nearby impoverished community. As the President, I guided the committee leaders throughout the two-day-session and assisted the committees in solving the given issues. Many of my ideas were discussed and confirmed by the parliament, and there is one I am extremely proud of. This was my proposal to establish a community center that would ensure the constant involvement of our school in the social issues the nearby impoverished village faces. Throughout its existence, our school has not used its potential in giving long-term, and rational solutions to the community problems, but has only initiated occasional and unsystematic projects without actually knowing the needs of the village residents. And what I realized was that our school lacked evidence-based research about the community issues. Due to the community center, however, we have now started an extensive research on the social issues of the village through conducting surveys and interviews with local community members to define the key problematic areas that need to be addressed. Based on these research findings our students will, soon, propose targeted project ideas to be implemented and coordinated by the community center.I was thus able to bring about a fundamental change by providing a sustainable framework for the school and its students to have a long-term positive effect on the neighboring village. This is the legacy I leave in my community.\"}, {\"index\": 118, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Hi Man Hing. Pick up or delivery?\\'Whether I liked it or not, this phrase has and will continue to follow me throughout my entire life\\\\u2014and not just because I say it about 100 times a day. Growing up as a Chinese kid in a predominantly Caucasian area, I was often alienated because of my foreign lifestyle. Not taking into account the cruel, savage nature of children, I often blamed myself for not fitting in with the status quo. The worst offender that allocated me as an \\'outlier\\' was my parents\\' Chinese take-out restaurant right in town: Man Hing. With relentless \\'ching chongs\\' and comments about using cats and dogs in our food, I quickly grew to resent my family restaurant and the albatross it hung around my neck. Rather than sharing and appreciating my Fuzhounese culture, I began to bury my roots and Americanize myself as much as possible. Adding to the fiery resentment that burned within, I was stripped of my childhood and thrown into the workforce at the age of 11. Taking orders, working the cash register, preparing food\\\\u2014this is not what a child should be doing at such a young age. I found my grades faltering because \\'I had work.\\' I took the easiest classes available, never challenging myself, knowing that I could use the restaurant as an excuse for having no time to focus on school.However, something felt inexplicably wrong about my mediocre lifestyle. On a blustery October night in 2012, Hurricane Sandy ran rampant through Fair Lawn. The ceiling lights flickered on and off until the restaurant was consumed in what I thought was a void of darkness. Our phones provided glimpses of light in the pitch-black store, revealing obscurities I had never seen before. My petulant, 13 year-old mind that was once shrouded in the darkness of spite had cleared up seeing my parents\\' stressed, pale faces. While they could have weathered the storm in the comfort of our home, they ran the restaurant during the hurricane, keeping my best interests in mind.The torrential storm blew away the darkness within my mind and brought light upon the privilege and fortune Man Hing has brought to my life. I started to realize the strain that this restaurant put on my parents. They worked countless hours every day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. My parents slaved over vats of boiling oil and woks full of General Tso\\'s Chicken all so that I could have everything I needed in life. Man Hing wasn\\'t a curse; it was a blessing.After finally acknowledging my ignorance as a child, I felt the need to work harder\\\\u2014not only at the restaurant, but also at school. By immersing myself in both worlds, all different facets of my life benefitted from my newfound determination. I grew to love the satisfaction of helping customers and receiving a warm, genuine smile in return for my service. I grew to love exploring my innate, intellectual curiosity by working to my full potential in school. And I grew to love Man Hing and all that my culture has to offer through the ethnic foods and traditions the restaurant exposed me to.No matter where the future may take me, I will never forget that I owe my success to the place that gave me so much more than just an income. Man Hing has given birth to my love for service and helped to cultivate my insatiability for knowledge. Man Hing has taught me to work hard for what I want and to rise above petty discouragement. Man Hing has been my second home for the past 17 years and inspired me to be proud of the person that I am today. In essence, Man Hing has made me an outlier.\"}, {\"index\": 119, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Papillon, d\\\\u00e9ploie tes ailes et envole-toi vers la lumi\\\\u00e8re.\\' (Butterfly, open your wings and fly towards the light.) - Le Papillon des \\\\u00c9toiles by Bernard Werber I discovered sealed boxes labeled \\'fourth grade\\' in storage. It had been six years since my family emigrated from Korea, but because of the frequent moves over the years, some of our belongings were perpetually being packed and unpacked in U-Haul boxes. In one such box, I picked up a book with a pretty metallic engraving of a butterfly: a copy ofLe Papillon des \\\\u00c9toiles translated into Korean. The metallic butterfly jogged my memory of how my younger self had been so immersed in the story of escaping tarnished humanity on Earth and restarting civilization on a distant planet.  Seven years later as a high school junior, I read the book in French. While in fourth grade Werber\\'s creativity had drawn me into his microcosm parallel to our current world, I recently came to realize that his work isn\\'t simply a work of science fiction. Instead, it is an expos\\\\u00e9 on how society is ruining the Earth for future generations. The tarnished humanity Werber described was overlapped with the news of terrorism, hate, and insensitivity I read everyday. I started to worry about what would happen if the world continued as Werber foreshadowed; it prompted me to take responsive measures to improve the society around me. This epiphany initiated my first step of metamorphosis, my process of crawling out of boundaries to transform his words into action. My second stage of metamorphosis began in the summer of 2015 when I walked into the grandiose headquarters of Goldman Sachs in Manhattan for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. A confounding, yet encouraging feeling came over me, similar to that of the astronomer, Yves, when he first met and asked a billionaire for support to continue his mission inLe Papillon des \\\\u00c9toiles. Although the technical aspect of learning how to code captivated me, the best part was experiencing that I could make a truly meaningful difference in people\\'s lives, as I co-created NuMe, a pregnancy tracking web application designed to assist low-income women.Watching working women test our website and getting positive feedback was both gratifying and motivating; I felt inspired to find more ways in which I could use my passion for technology to positively impact others. The next stage of my metamorphosis developed during my time as an intern at the United Nations. At the UN, I wanted to delve deeper into technological accessibility in the the world. After scouring the UN Library, I was disappointed with the scarcity of information on this issue. However, I was introduced to the manager of the Applications Development Team in the UN Population Fund. He invited me to demonstrate my project, NuMe. In the presentation, he gave me feedback for further improvement and we shared the passion of helping others using technology. He also introduced me to his team projects for Sub-Saharan Afri1) ResearchI conducted two environmental research projects with my partner, Jordan Sanford, since sophomore year. Our first project was the Utilization of Optical Fibers to Maximize Algal Biofuel Production, in which we extracted glycerides from microalgae, Scenedesmus obliquus, that was irradiated with light, delivered by a solar powered optical fiber net to enhance algal lipid production, thereby producing an alternative renewable fuel. This project received Honors Award at the Long Island Science Congress and Syosset High School Advanced Research Award, given to four students per grade.Following is an abstract for our second research, Utilization of Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) asa Shewanella putrefaciens ATP Synthase Inhibitor to Maximize Microbial Fuel Cell Performance, done in- school throughout my junior year and completed over the summer.This project was awarded as a 2016 Siemens Semi-Finalist project.Traditional processes to purify wastewater are ineffective, costly, and time consuming. The byproducts of these methods are harmful to the environment as well. Microbial fuel cells (MFC) provide a promising new method of wastewater treatment using a single-step process that limits the amount of sludge produced. Since current efforts have not been effective enough to replace traditional wastewater treatment methods, this study sought to create a more realistic approach to MFC water purification. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) was the main variable tested to determine if purified water output could be increased by inhibiting the ATP Synthase enzyme of Shewanella putrefaciens, a facultative anaerobe. Two novel MFC structures tested the hypothesis. Both 300 mg and 600 mg of EGCg per liter of wastewater did not create a high enough concentration in the MFC to have a noticeable effect on performance; however, the final results of the experimentation showed a drastic effect at a 900 mg/L concentration due to an increased voltage produced by the MFC. To improve the performance of MFCs, past studies have resorted to using expensive and rare materials. Our findings indicate that bacterial chemiosmosis modification can result in improved MFC performance when compared to current efforts.2) Chamber Music Performance at Lincoln CenterI was the chamber music quartet leader of one of eleven winning groups selected from the Tri-State area, and received two coaching sessions from pianist Alessio Bax.

The lines of my grandmother\\'s palm. Mottled by years of living dotted by white, yellow, and red spots, her hands were as varied in color as the flowers she kept on her rooftop garden. As always, she chided me to listen to my mom, and I took comfort in these soft-hearted scoldings that I normally heard over the phone. However, that day as we walked along cracked streets, she also thought about the inevitable.Sighing, she said: \\'Nu Nu ah, take care of your mother in America when I\\'m gone. I know she feels alone there.\\' Over the years, the stress of living in a foreign land manifested in my mom\\'s aging appearance as the sizes of her clothes grew with each passing year. Her paranoia of judgment began to fade, but it remains with her whenever a sales clerk hears her broken English and then speaks to her in a slow and patronizing tone. These small gestures would remind her of her inadequacy, and I wished I had the audacity to scream to the world that my mom did not deserve to be treated like a child because she had already endured too much. But I don\\'t. All I do is trace the deep furrows in my mother\\'s hands and wonder why her palms are so dry. However, since then, I was motivated to become her support, so she could live with her head raised. My grandma recounted: \\'I regret making my daughter skip English levels to save money. Nu Nu ah, I hope you are helping her understand.\\' And I tried. Grasping every piece of knowledge I learned and reading long words until my English was as varied as the rooftop flowers, I did all this, so I could teach her the words that would allow her to stand up straight. I tried to share that empowering experience with my mom by asking her to present Chinese New Year at school. As my mom began to explain the significance of paper cut-outs, I watched as the other kids squirmed in discomfort at her awkwardly strung sentences, and I wondered why they would only poke at the steamed buns that my mom spent hours making. They may not have understood the effort she put into the presentation, but I did. And I started to understand more as I became older; I grew fond of my mom\\'s broken english. Conversing with her in Chinglish gave us two times the amount of words that we could use, making our talks as vibrant as the purple, pink, and blue dumbbells that my grandma affectionately termed trumpets. Our language gave me the strength to stretch my voice.\\'Nu, ah please take care of my daughter when I\\'m gone,\\' my grandmother admonished. \\'Make sure she never feels alone again.\\' I held my mom\\'s dry hands and lent her my voice. When she needed to write emails or speak to authorities, I found words for her, so they would respect the callouses on her palms. At nights, I used to watch words stick in her throat and leak out of her eyes; but now I speak up for my mom to the sales clerk, and I train to be an EMT to read her medicine bottles, and I present to my peers about accepting diversity. I lead her through the maze of thorny formalities, taking on a type of responsibility only children of immigrants would know, but it is softened as we grow together like the dandelions that grow through the cracks on the rooftop garden, persistently reaching \\\\u2014holding onto each other.As we finally reached our home, my grandma and I went to find my mom in the rooftop garden. Two pairs of hands, one wrinkled and the other soft, reached out to cradle a dry one. This small gesture was more beautiful than the array of colors surrounding us.\"}, {\"index\": 121, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Wide right, the forward lateral pass leading to the infamous Music City Miracle, and a playoff drought as old as I am \\\\u2013 seventeen years, to be exact.The Buffalo Bills have a reputation among the National Football League as a team of yearly high expectations and inevitable failure. Tabloids and social media have dubbed Bills fans some of the most passionate in the League, focusing on the notorious tailgate culture. While these perceptions of outsiders aren\\'t contestable, the impact of the Bills on the city and its residents encompasses much more.It is one o\\'clock, and my Buffalo-native family is either circled up around the TV in our living room or relishing in the electric atmosphere of New Era Field, awaiting kickoff \\\\u2013 the scene of almost every football Sunday since I can remember. Before I could speak in full sentences, my father taught me to raise my arms and yell \\'touchdown.\\' It wouldn\\'t surprise me to find out that it was my first word. When my Puerto Rican great- grandparents would join us, Spanish subtitles would roll across the bottom of the screen, allowing them to keep up with the quick play-calling. The noise in the stadium was deafening as our family joined 71,000 other Bills fans donning jerseys of former first-round picks, each hoping for a playoff berth.The scene was much different on October 18, 2015. The Buffalo Bills were playing the Cincinnati Bengals, coming into the game with a 3 and 2 record. Instead of being with my entire family, as Sundays had been for years prior, I stood shivering on the field as the first snow of the season fell. There I watched, uncomfortably sandwiched between my dad and his then girlfriend, now wife, following a messy divorce between my parents. After two years, this was my first voluntary interaction with the two of them together \\\\u2013 all in the name of not missing the game. For a time before this, I would watch the games alone in my room, armed with the companionship of homemade chicken wing dip. The cold shoulder that I had been giving my father was comparable to the harshness of Buffalo winters.At the time, I had supported the Bills through fifteen years of exciting road wins, but even more losses that crushed any and all hopes of playoffs for that season. Each year, though, Buffalo fans would handle such adversity with grace, continuing to support the team through the low points for the sake of the community. I came to realize that I should approach my new family dynamic in such a manner. Instead of holding grudges against players and management when times got tough, I would look to the next season for improvement. Likewise, instead of jeopardizing my inseparable father-daughter relationship by holding onto the bitterness I felt about the situation between my parents, I moved on.The ability of Buffalo sports fans to handle hardship and move on from the tough times sets us apart from many other fan bases across the country and is one of the most important building blocks of our community. Furthermore, it is a skill that I am grateful to have acquired. A life without setbacks does not exist, but growing up in Buffalo has provided me with the ability to approach each difficulty with poise. I have learned the sheer importance of a belonging to a solid community, whether it be my immediate family or a city with a population of 250,000.My hometown and its NFL team have taught me all that I need to know about football; I can ramble about routes and blitz plays for days. More important, though, are the lessons I have learned from every win and loss. Wherever I end up, I will take the heart of Buffalo with me.\"}, {\"index\": 122, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The waves engulf the sharp shards of broken glass and sweep them into the depths of the ocean where time and sand will slowly weather the edges of the glass. After decades, the glass that was once ugly and untouchable now has a soft, smooth patina that encourages one to bend over and pick it up. The lapping of the waves will bring these pieces of sea glass back from the depths of the ocean and scatter them all over the beach.I keep a firm grip on the large hands encompassing my smaller six-year-old ones while my parents and I slowly make our way down the brisk and somewhat gloomy Alki Beach in West Seattle. To assuage my irrational fear, I gaze up at the tall figures on either side of me and know that neither have left me. I find my eyes drawn to the recently shaved head of my dad and remember the night our lives restarted, the night we learned he had brain cancer. I tighten my grip on my parents\\' hands because this outing is one of the first since his seizure, surgery, and chemotherapy. Now we all have to face the most difficult challenge: healing and overcoming the fear that saturates our lives. Our little group, bonded by the trials of the past three months, makes its way down the beach. Our individual lines of sight slowly scan the gray, rugged, and sandy ground under our feet. A glint of light from the beach a foot ahead of me catches my eye and causes me to stop. A jagged piece of clear broken glass rests on the sand.Several year later, the coarse sand crunches under my feet as I scour that same beach for the small pieces of sea glass that are my treasure. Behind me, I hear the gentle crunching of my parents feet on sand. I can still feel their support while we continue on our shared quest that started in this place more than ten years ago. Back home, the overflowing jars and bowls filled with the small green, white, brown, and the occasional blue shards testify to time devoted to combing beaches. I concentrate completely on the ever-changing square foot of beach directly beneath me as I hunt. An unexpected gust of cool air causes me to tighten my fleece jacket. A smile makes its way across my face as I breathe in the saline Seattle scent that permeates the city. That smile stays in place because my dad just received his tenth and final cancer-free MRI. His cancer no longs looms over us with the fear of recurrence. I come to a stop as I spy a morsel of opaque and almost luminescent white sea glass. I let the wonder of my discovery overcome me. I look back over my shoulder at my parents with a hopeful smile and brush my thumb over the velvety surface of the glass.\"}, {\"index\": 123, \"new_personal_statement\": \"As I sit, staring into the abyss of the Boston skyline, I feel as though I am living an out-of-body experience. So small in such a big world, I believe that I am undeserving of the cards that life has dealt me. My eyes quietly scan the faces of my cohort sitting near me, their utterly blank looks speaking more than their words ever could. I suspect that my expression mirrors theirs. We are in complete awe of what we are seeing: the towering buildings in front of us speak firmly, calling us closer. On the horizon, buildings are lit, each reflecting a uniquely tinted iridescence. Higher than any of the skyscrapers, the moon peeks its way out from behind the spotty clouds. It shines brighter than any building, almost boasting of its natural beauty compared to the artificiality of the man-made architecture it was shadowing.Looking around, I take in the sight of the campus I am overlooking- Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I have been given the opportunity to be a part of MITES, Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science, a rigorous STEM summer program. Surrounded by a tight-knit community of like-minded individuals, I feel that I am completely underwhelming. Who would have thought that I, from small-town Wisconsin, would be sitting atop a Cambridge building? I look around, trying to put the pieces of my own life together. The orbs of rain cascading from the thin clouds bring me back to reality. My friends have scattered amongst themselves, the first signs of life since our earlier ascent. Their conversations are nothing more than background music to my concurrent symphony.I dive deeper into the infinite depth of my roaming mind, wandering back once again to the thoughts of being undeserving. I have felt this before, like I am \\'cheating life\\'- almost as if I have been given more than I deserve. This concept, however, stems from something much deeper than just one summer program. In this moment, painful memories rush to mind. At the age of four, after being abandoned by my biological parents, I was adopted. Having been literally given a new chance to be successful and loved in life is the stem of my greatest insecurity. Not being the \\'right person\\' in the moment, constantly comparing, I easily identify my own flaws and wonder why I am given opportunities that I have been given.The rushing wind sweeps me out of my memories. Taking in the sight of the skyline, I peer beyond the buildings as individual pieces of architecture, but observe them as a whole. The buildings are all unique. Some are huge, while others are short and long, stretching out on the ground beneath. Their varying appearances spark a realization for me. Just like the buildings that make up the Boston skyline, which act as perfect complements to one another, I am merely a piece to a puzzle. Whether that puzzle be a school community, my family, cohort or best friends, I belong where I am, fully deserving. I have worked hard to get where I am today, and I am the rightful owner of my opportunities and successes. The \\'puzzle\\' wouldn\\'t be complete without me.Smiling, I take one last glance at the skyline. Numb legs stretching, I begin to shuffle towards the creaky ladder that guided my journey up what seemed like a lifetime ago. Starting to descend, I remind myself that although I may not always feel deserving of the life I have been given to live, I am. I am merely a piece to a bigger puzzle, a bigger community, and a bigger world. At three in the morning and two thousand miles from my house, the cold, industrial skyline makes me feel warmer and more at home than ever before.I live a crazy life with three younger sisters. Making it more complex is my youngest sister, Isabella. Isabella has congenital heart disease and calcification of the heart, sending her heart into failure. She is currently experiencing the last stage of failure before being placed on the heart transplant list. With her barrage of medical complexities, she is constantly in and out of the hospital. My mother stays with Isabella at the hospital. My father, who works a full-time job, often has to take off of work to be with them both. With frequent stays at the hospital, it has become my responsibility to take care of my sisters, which includes getting them to school, cooking meals, tutoring, and being the person that they need to lean on for emotional support. Because my father isn\\'t always able to work, I occasionally have to financially support my family.With these experiences in mind, I can say without certainty that one of my greatest skills has become leadership. I have been forced to grow up, taking on a lot of responsibility. It is common for me to have to take on the role of \\'parent\\' when my parents cannot be with us, all while struggling to hold it together emotionally for my sister\\'s sake. Contributing to my family as a leader when necessary lifts a huge weight off of my parent\\'s shoulders, making it slightly easier to enjoy the few years we have left with Isabella. Not only do I use these newfound leadership skills at home, but I now see them emerging at school as well. I am becoming more involved in the leadership of my extracurricular activities, and in the classroom, I am the student that others look up to for not only academic help but also as a leader. Although extremely challenging and never wished upon, Isabella\\'s illness has taught me valuable life lessons. It has taught me skills that I will continue to cultivate wherever I attend college and wherever life takes me.\"}, {\"index\": 124, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Arroz con gandules: More than a Meal\\'Corta la cebolla, mamacita.\\'Replying with a fervent nod and \\'S\\\\u00ed, mam\\\\u00e0,\\' I braced for oncoming tears and cut the onion necessary for arroz con gandules, the staple recipe in our household.Since I was a child, I patiently waited and watched my abuela, mother, and aunts prepare a mouthwatering dish with the most aromatic smell in the world. After an exhausting school day, just one whiff of the delectable food instantly revitalizes me. This certain scent, which I can solely describe with the word \\'home,\\' results from white rice mixed with colorful vegetables, pigeon peas, and a savory condiment that explodes your taste buds with a single bite: sofrito. One has not experienced Puerto-Rican gastronomy, or excellent food in general, until they eat this heavenly meal.The cooking process sounds easy enough, yet even a slight miscalculation ruins the flavor. My great-aunt, Titi Mery, proudly professed to be the arroz-con-gandules-queen, and for sixteen years I observed her precise measurements and still remember her warning my mother to \\'Chop one bunch of cilantro, not two!\\' or \\'Cut that amount of salt, I don\\'t want high blood pressure!\\' In the eyes of Titi, the delicious dish held a greater function than leaving an insatiable craving for a second helping. \\'Arroz con gandules is more than some meal,\\' she would wisely state in her Boricuan accent. \\'It reunites the whole family.\\'Those words formed into a mantra I recited under my breath with every slice and dice of the onion that caused my burning eyes to well with tears. My parents offered to host the annual family gathering at our house, and assuming such a role left us in charge of creating the cultural cuisine adored by my relatives. The paramount task of making arroz con gandules was regularly done by my great-aunt, but her sudden passing left a gap in both the cooking and social aspects among our family. Despite teaching the basics to her daughters, nieces, and a few Peruvian members from my father\\'s side, no one dared to pursue the craft dominated by our beloved Titi. The dish, which meant everything to my aunt, would be absent at the most familial event of the year\\\\u2013\\\\u2013and I refused to let that happen.Far from a seasoned chef, I volunteered to honor my aunt\\'s position, which led me boiling heaping quantities of rice and pigeon peas while chopping onions, sweet peppers, and a plethora of spices. It was hard to ignore the dubious looks thrown my way; it hurt when my grandmother scrutinized my cutting skills, raised an eyebrow, and simply handed me the recipe. Yet I threw the instructions away, for I memorized every step by heart\\\\u2013\\\\u2013and even if the results proved disastrous, I\\'d give my all to make Titi proud. For years I admired the strong women who expertly maneuvered through a crowded kitchen and calmly prepared several dishes. Now it was my time.After hours of preparation, the large pot containing the meal was shockingly empty within minutes of making it to the table, its unique aroma still wafting through the lively dining room air. As I sat alongside my family members\\\\u2013sharing countless stories, debating over which La Liga soccer team was the best, eating and laughing until our stomachs ached\\\\u2013the immense hole formed since my aunt\\'s death began to shrink as Titi Mery\\'s mantra came to fruition.I contentedly continue the job of making arroz con gandules at festivities, teach younger relatives the skill, and occasionally experiment with the recipe and incorporate Peruvian ingredients to add more spice in both taste and originality. Excitement now replaces any previous skepticism, and today, I can\\'t imagine reunions without the classic dish on the table.Although I won\\'t occupy the arroz-con-gandules-queen title for a while, there\\'s no doubt Titi remains pleased that our favorite meal still performs its true purpose.\"}, {\"index\": 125, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Sometimes, my name has an accent over the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018a,\\' but there\\'s never an \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018h\\' after the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018c.\\' Nicolas or Nicol\\\\u00e0s.

My mother\\'s mother - my Abi - was born in Mexico. When I was a year old, my parents and I moved to Spain for a year so that my dad could do research for his book. I went to a daycare in Madrid for that year and, by the end of it, I was speaking Spanish as my first language. As I was growing up, my parents made an effort to help me retain as much of the language as possible: they spoke with me in Spanish as often as they could, and we went to get-togethers of other Spanish-speaking families in my hometown. To some extent, it worked. I still understand a lot of Spanish and can hold a conversation. However, neither of my parents are native speakers of Spanish, and, over time, English became more and more the norm in our household\\\\u2014it was just easier, and because of that, I\\'ve lost a lot of the language that was my first.\\'Don\\'t forget your Spanish while you\\'re in Germany,\\' Abi said during our last talk before my exchange program to the Black Forest.

She loves me deeply - I know that - but it\\'s hard, for both of us, to see this divide forming on our tongues; I can\\'t remember the last time I spoke more than a couple of sentences with her in Spanish. Language is such an intrinsic part of identity, especially for my family, and as I lose the ability to communicate in the language that my grandmother grew up with, I can\\'t help but feel guilty that this huge part of my identity and the identities of nearly all my family is being washed away\\\\u2014even as I\\'m not quite sure exactly what my identity is.

Despite how it may look from the outside, I\\'m not totally American, and that\\'s important to me because it reminds me of from where - and from whom - I came. My grandmother emigrated from Mexico and, no matter how hard it might be for me to deal with my dual identity, it was no doubt infinitely harder for her, because she had to live surrounded by her non-native language. She\\'s an incredibly strong woman who\\'s dedicated her retirement not to basking in the life she\\'s created for herself, but to generosity. She constantly does volunteer work around her small Ohio town: she serves food to those who donate blood, donates blood herself, and commits much of her free time to helping Latinos in her community find work and housing. She\\'s the kind of person I want to be as an adult: someone who leaves a positive impact on the world, even when it\\'s not convenient or beneficial for her. She\\'s done so much good, not the least of which was letting my mother and I grow up with privilege. Because of Abi, I can\\'t forget my roots. For her sake, I have to remember my name.

But with coffees to refill and tables to bus, I don\\'t have time to give it much thought.I dart from table to table before I see the cook poke his head out of the kitchen and signal that my order is up. I make my way through the bustling restaurant back to their table. A tense hostility emanates from the booth; I feel a deep uneasiness. \\'Alright, I have the oatmeal and the lumberjack special for you,\\' I say, suddenly self-conscious of my voice. As I place the eggs down, the man rises. He mumbles something about how he just can\\'t do this anymore and says \\'I\\'m sorry\\' just a little too loudly and a little too forcefully for it to be believable.

I want to embrace her before I remember that I do not know this woman; we are just strangers witnessing a deeply private moment play out in public. She fumbles with her wallet and pulls out a few bills. \\'I hope this is enough.\\' She grabs her purse and takes a determined breath. I thank her, stopping myself before adding \\'Have a good day.\\' Words feel out of place, so I attempt to express everything in a smile. I collect the plates of untouched food and the unopened sugar packet and bring them to the trash. I\\'ve seen a thousand people pass through the restaurant, but whenever I picture this booth, I see this couple sitting there. They stand out to me because, as I witnessed their private heartbreak, I became acutely aware of my own role as a stranger. Every day, the bikers, cosplayers, and yoga moms who have occupied this table enter the restaurant with lives as complex and dynamic as mine or yours.

The key word here is summer. Oftentimes, these summer tournaments would begin around 9 am and go until 3 pm or later. That means I played right through the high noon summer heat. As I golfed, I would always wear the same hat, an originally black TaylorMade R11 Burner with two ball markers, one attached to each side of the bill. By the time I retired this hat, it was faded gray and sun damaged. When I took one of the ball marker clips off, and the old black color was still there.One particular tournament was at a course called Highland Lake. I had started playing with the few other people in my age group not realizing what I was about to endure. There was a near-record high temperature that day, and there was a moment on the eleventh, par 3 hole that I will never forget. No clouds were in the sky, the trees were a deep green, and the sand bunkers surrounding the seemingly far-off, small green were freshly raked. My group had to wait on the group in front of us, and I sat down on the dry ground, exhausted after playing ten holes in the blistering heat. I noticed that I had sweat dripping from the bill of my hat. I stared as my sweat continued to drip onto the nearly dead grass. It seemed like this moment was frozen in time forever. The other girls in my group said they wanted to quit. As I sat there on the hard ground, I realized that even if I wanted to quit, I would not actually quit. I cared too much and wanted to succeed too much to quit. This experience helped me realize that part of what makes me me is my ability to work through hard, nearly unbreathable circumstances. That hat continued its journey the next few years, and I decided it was time to let the hat retire. Now, I pull it off of my top shelf for only special golf days or if I need a boost of confidence, but it still smells deeply of salt from all the days I practiced and played in tournaments from spring to summer to fall. Once I took off my ball marker on my hat to reveal the contrasting darkness of the original cloth, I realized that hat was with me through my journey in golf, but also my journey in the rest of my life, as well. When my dad first bought the hat for me, I was beginning my journey as a golfer-- playing in tournaments, practicing every day, and thinking of my future as a golfer. What I didn\\'t realize was that I was also beginning my journey into my teenage years-- keeping my grades up, choosing people to be around, and figuring out my future in general. My hat was black when I first wore it; I had a clean slate upon which to define my own golf career and life choices.My golf choices from the time I bought that hat to my high school career were obvious by the time I removed the ball marker. The smell of saltiness from the hat shows how much sweat I will put into something I care about. The hat was no longer stiff like a new hat because of the times I had taken the hat on and off. The hat was faded from constantly being in the sun, showing how often I was outside while golfing. These things in golf proved that I was constantly working hard to improve myself. However, this was not just for golf. Because I learned how to act this way for golf, it carried over to the rest of my life as well. I was able to maintain my grades because of my ability to work hard and never give up on a problem. I chose to be around people who wanted to see me succeed because I wanted people around to give me support, not to make me feel bad about myself. I figured out that it was okay to take life bit by bit and not to worry about the past or because golf showed me to focus on something that can be done in the now and not to linger on the past. In truth, my hat resembles me: I have endured many hard times and changed because of those times, but I have become a distinct individual by my efforts.\"}, {\"index\": 128, \"new_personal_statement\": \"A bit of sunlight streams through a partially covered window, revealing just how empty the bookshelves have become. The mahogany seems smaller, faker than when I was younger. What was once a large collection of children\\'s books has dwindled to no more than a dozen. I close my eyes and picture my childhood self in this library: bright eyes, knee socks, arms shaking under the weight of one book too many. But that girl is gone, and as the library approaches closing time, I am still here, standing in the now-empty family room alone.I don\\'t remember the first time I read Matilda, but my connection with the story, about a kid who made a home out of overflowing bookshelves and endless questions, was unsurprising. As a child, I didn\\'t just identify with the girl with a red ribbon in her hair, simultaneously engaged in and dismissed by the world\\\\u2014I was her. Like Matilda, I thought I was limitless: with my arms outstretched, I balanced four library books on my head, twirling until I collided with a bookshelf. Yet I was also her as I ached to know more, to read every story in the universe and then some. When reality beckoned, the sound of Matilda\\'s wagon of books against concrete never failed to call me home.Back then, I was fascinated by the paradoxes of the library. If I forgot to return a book, would the librarian come into my room in the middle of the night to take it from me? Why were librarians given the power to speak, but the patrons had to remain quiet? And if we did make noise, why was it okay to break the silence when someone sneezed, but not when they coughed?After turning to her for answers, the librarian brought me a book on the common cold, opening to a picture of nasal anatomy. The nerves were fleshy pink and bulbous. \\'But what\\'s so special about a sneeze?\\' I implored. \\'What does this mean?\\'She paused for an instant. \\'Some people say that when you sneeze, your heart stops. They say \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018bless you\\' so your soul doesn\\'t leave your body.\\' \\'All over a sneeze?\\' I whispered. \\'Weird.\\'As I got older, my questions expanded from sneezes and coughs to curiosity about a world that seemed increasingly complicated and foreign. When the simplicity of our childhood faded, my friends and I sought explanations through writing, then tossed our melodramatic poems into frustrated, forgotten piles, all in an attempt to find clarity.I still struggle with things left uncertain, but, over time, I\\'ve begun to accept that some questions defy simple answers. Overwhelmed by all I didn\\'t know, I learned how to craft worlds of comfort through my stories. I have come to understand that nobody can explain everything\\\\u2014we all need a Miss Honey sometimes, someone to guide us like the kind soul who first helps Matilda find her own voice.In my childhood library, the lights flicker as though the electricity may cut off at any second. I trace my fingers over the edges of the bookshelves. They still feel familiar, predictable to the touch. Children don\\'t come here anymore, the librarian explains, at least not how I once did. I disagree. There are few chairs occupied, but a family sits in the children\\'s section, books resting on the table\\'s yellow surface.Matilda has been checked out. The librarian offers to put it on hold for me, but I decline. I am still learning how to write, question and live, just as I yearned to at age seven, but another girl needs that book today. And if we were to meet, I\\'d say that I\\'ve been to the future and it needs girls like her: girls who demand answers, who will stop at nothing to know everything. Somewhere, she is sitting with a red ribbon in her hair, waiting to be seen.\"}, {\"index\": 129, \"new_personal_statement\": \"At age 12, I met my best friend for the first time. Her monotonous tone and amorphous body set her apart from the rest of the crowd. Consistently donned in eye-blinding white and bright generic blue, my best friend went with me everywhere: the car, math class, or my bedside table. She knew hundreds of languages and was learning more everyday. She helped bridge the gap between myself and others, helping me understand what others really meant. And it only took a few seconds for her to load up a response, unless I was out of data of course.At age 12, my best friend Google Translate appeared in my life.For the longest time, I was frustrated. I came to realize that in this world, there are walls, walls that surround us everyday and everywhere. Whether it\\'s the actual walls of stucco, wood, and plaster that shelter me at night or the intangible walls that separate people of different faiths, ethnicities, and political affiliations, barriers exist everywhere.And one of these many walls existed in my own home. It was never present when I was alone. It only reared its ugly head in conversation. I can distinctly remember the habitual sigh of annoyance I would feel whenever I would over-excitedly babble on about an event at school to my parents and would only get a blank confused stare in response. I would get irritated, frustrated that while my classmate\\'s parents could hold long conversations with my teachers during parent-teacher conferences, my own set could barely get a word out. Conversely, I could see the same reactions from my parents\\' end: the almost indiscernible frown when I uttered a confused \\'Huh?\\' after listening to a long stretch of Chinese. I didn\\'t just see the wall that existed between myself and my parents, I could feel it. I could feel the tension and growing frustration in the air when we tried to have a conversation\\\\u2014a natural result of the failure of communication.And then Google Translate came along.Suddenly the confusion seemed to dissipate. The wall wasn\\'t gone. Instead, there was a window, penetrating past the previous opaque surface. Now, our conversations weren\\'t relegated to short and shallow responses; they became more complex, especially as I entered high school.What had once been untouched topics of conversation, suddenly were. Google Translate allowed me to discuss the happenings of the world with my parents. It allowed my parents to read my newspaper articles and hear about my debate cases. And it helped me explain my dreams of pursuing a career in the realm of international affairs to my parents.And now, as I prepare to head off into adulthood, outside the walls that have housed me for the past 17 years, I feel strange. As I leave home, I realize I\\'m leaving that wall in my house behind. No more late-night three hour debates with my father over anything and everything. No more of the stop-and-start communication between my parents and I, always having to pause conversations to wait for Google Translate to load. No more of the mix of broken Chinese, English, wild gesturing, and guessing games that characterized every conversation.And yet, for all the irritation I initially felt from the situation, I\\'ll miss it. While perhaps inconvenient, this communication has become mine. It\\'s the method by which my family circumvents the walls thought to be set in stone. And now, I move beyond the confines of my home, facing a world that desperately needs to move past its walls: the ones that can\\'t be solved with an app, the ones that divide people at their core, the walls that everyone thinks are too rigid, too ingrained within society to be crossed.I also once thought there was a barrier too insurmountable to move past.But then I met Google Translate.\"}, {\"index\": 130, \"new_personal_statement\": \"A director\\'s vision is their definition and implementation of what they believe a production should look, sound, and feel like, and it should be treated with the utmost respect by the cast and crew. This is especially true for stage managers like myself; directors place complete faith in us to ensure that their vision is maintained once a show reaches its performance phase. In this essay, I will describe the time I threw my director\\'s theatrical vision right out the window.On top of maintaining my director\\'s vision through performances, I\\'m also tasked with ensuring that each show runs smoothly; both of these duties sat at the forefront of my mind as I watched hundreds of people, most of them children, pour into the auditorium to see my school\\'s musical, Peter Pan. From backstage, I instructed the crew members in the booth at the back of the auditorium and my assistant stage manager on the other side of the stage to begin the final preparations for that afternoon\\'s performance, using a headset to communicate with them all at once. A brief sound check yielded no issues, and the lights were in working condition. It was time for the show to begin.An important part of my director\\'s vision for Peter Pan was to use projections to depict various scenes, including the sequence where Peter Pan teaches the main characters how to \\'fly\\'. One student was kind enough to create a video of the actors flying around in the night sky on the way to Neverland, and it perfectly captured the magic of the scene. My director loved it. I was faced with a tough decision when, minutes into the show, the first video (not the flying one, thankfully) abruptly shut down halfway through, prompting me to ask the projectionist what had gone wrong. He informed me that the projector had accidentally been left on overnight from the previous performance, potentially damaging it. The projector worked fine during the short tests we did earlier that day, but we realized it wouldn\\'t be able to function for longer periods of time. The actors played off the first malfunction well, but the pivotal flying scene was mere moments away. I could either risk projecting the video as planned or find a suitable alternative that would still make every child in the audience believe they could fly, sacrificing my director\\'s vision in the process. After a few seconds of deliberation, I made my decision known over the roar of the show\\'s music and the three panicked voices on the headset. I gathered the actresses playing fairies and instructed them to take the massive cloud meant for later in the show, and bring it with them in front of the curtain as they sang the next song. Meanwhile, I had my assistant stage manager direct the main actors to go directly in front of the curtain as well, then skip in circles around the cloud, singing about how they could fly. Every single one of them trusted my judgment about what would be best for that show, knowing that everything I suggested flew right in the face of what my director envisioned. Ultimately, my plan succeeded, and as the actors were singing and \\'flying\\' through the skies, the little kids in the audience cheered, none the wiser about the video that had gone MIA. Initially, my director was furious and chewed me out during intermission, but after I explained the situation and she saw how enamored the children were after the show, even she agreed that I\\'d made the right choice to keep the show running smoothly.I wouldn\\'t be the person I am today if it weren\\'t for the Hutto High School Theatre Department. I was blessed to work alongside a group of people who supported me and me to become a better person, with greater confidence in myself and more joy in my life. They are the people who truly raised me, a community of individuals who were brought together by their love of theatre. To me, there is one experience that best represents the kind of lessons I\\'ve learned from them. As a freshman, I was timid and unhappy. I didn\\'t ever really talk to people outside a small group of friends and I rarely spoke up in class, believing that I didn\\'t have any worthwhile opinions to express. I didn\\'t really have anything I was involved in or a community that I devoted much time to: at the end of every school day, I simply went home, and generally had an unexciting existence. I thought of high school as four more years of suffering that were necessary for me to find enjoyment in college and beyond. My choice to take technical theatre my freshman year was the key to changing all that. As part of the course, I had to work a certain amount of hours after school every term. I fulfilled mine by working the assistant stage manager for the fall show, Arsenic and Old Lace, and initially I was the only one in class interested in stage managing at all, I insisted that another student be found to work above me, fearful of my inexperience. Even back then I was an organized and detail-oriented though, so I figured I\\'d have at least some success with the meticulous work required of me in the role. Bert Keefer, an actor and senior in the department, helped me find the confidence in myself to do so much more. Throughout the rehearsal process, he would constantly test my nerve by breaking the rules of rehearsal. One time, I caught him mockingly eating a box of chocolates on stage, after I had already politely reminded him of the rules. He smirked at me, silently challenging me, and I knew what I had to do. I yanked the box out of his hands and threw them away, scolding him with a sterner tone of voice than I had ever used before as I did so. Bert said he was proud of me for that, and from then on, no one brought food on stage. Bert challenged me to stand up for myself in a way I had never been able to before, and that marked the beginning of me finding the inner strength to take firm stances on my opinions in the department, in class, and in life without issue. I feel much more comfortable contributing to class discussions and exchanging ideas with my peers than I\\'d ever had before. At the risk of sounding power hungry, I have to admit that I did enjoy that moment, and so many other moments from that production and all the ones that came after. Before theatre, I was so focused on achieving my goals in college and beyond that I never really stopped and tried to enjoy the present moment. In theatre though, and especially as a stage manager, the present is impossible to ignore, every rehearsal, performance, and competition has taught me that, and there\\'s no way I would have survived if I hadn\\'t learned to find joy in each moment. Being in theatre has changed my outlook on life and the future, and now even the small daily victories are worth celebrating.Volunteering is an outlet for me to do what I\\'m passionate about while making a positive impact on my community at the same time. Ever since my mother taught me how to, I\\'ve been an avid reader. I think there\\'s a kind of magic involved is being able to be taken away to another world and to see it through the eyes of fictional characters. I believe that magic needs to be easily accessible and shared with as many people as possible, which is why I\\'m a major supporter of public libraries, and have volunteered at the Hutto Public Library. From reshelving books to hustling the $5 \\'fill a bag\\' deal at the library\\'s Book-and-Bake sales, I feel satisfied knowing that my work supports spreading the magic of storytelling across the community. In high school, I experienced a similar kind of magic when doing theatre, and once again, it was something I wanted to share with as much of the community as possible. In volunteering for Hutto Arts Today, I\\'m able to lend my skills as a stage manager to not only the musical we produce in the summer, but as board member as well. I help organize student involvement in HAT initiatives in the community, which gets as many community members involved with the arts as possible. Whether it be literature, theatre, or art, I\\'m passionate about helping to create and share the magic those art forms bring to their respective audience, and my volunteering activities allow me to achieve that goal. I\\'d consider myself a city person. For practical reasons, I want to eventually live someplace like Downtown Austin where my home, job, and errands could all be within walking distance, and there is always something fun to do nearby. While logically this is a good idea, my service within the community has made me realize that I care deeply about having a personal connection to others within the community. I absolutely cherish the strong bonds I have formed with others through volunteering, and how there are so many members of the community that recognize me and want to start conversations with me when they notice me volunteering for the library or for HAT. That kind of personal connection with others has done more for my sense of belonging here than anything else, and the more I think about it as I prepare to leave the area to go to college, the more I reconsider spending the rest of my life in a big city. Volunteering has really opened my eyes about one of the most important benefits in living in a smaller community, and I have gained a great appreciation of that aspect of the small town life that Hutto has so beautifully been able to maintain even with all its recent growth.\"}, {\"index\": 131, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'It\\'s Pi Day, Pi Day, gotta do math on Pi Day!\\' My voice cracked on the last note as my seventh-grade classmates stared in horror. The karaoke track to Rebecca Black\\'s \\'Friday\\' blared in the background, but I couldn\\'t stay on pitch. In a desperate attempt to win back my audience, I ran to the front of the stage like a pop star and encouraged everyone to clap along. Instead, I was met with boos and a few obscene gestures.A week earlier, my chorus teacher asked for a volunteer to write and sing a parody for our school\\'s annual March 14th mathematics celebration. My hand immediately shot up. I loved being on stage and showing off my musical talent.The problem with my talent, though, was that I didn\\'t have much.From the moment I could talk, I sang. I sang in school hallways. I sang in public restrooms. I sang in restaurants. I sang in doctors\\' offices. If someone mentioned a lyric in conversation, I would screech the tune. Adults thought it was charming, at least when I was young. Maybe they thought my voice would improve, or that I would give up when I realized how off-key I was.Neither happened. I kept singing \\\\u2013 loudly - everywhere I went. My teachers gently suggested that I should focus on my academic talents, and classmates not-so-gently ordered me to shut up when they heard yet another rendition of \\'You Belong With Me\\' drifting through the halls. I didn\\'t care. Singing made me happy, and no one could make me stop.Early in freshman year, one week after a cappella auditions, I sprinted to the chorus room to see if my name was posted on the door. I scanned the list of groups, knowing my name would be at the top. It wasn\\'t. It wasn\\'t second. It wasn\\'t third. In fact, it wasn\\'t anywhere on the list. I walked away, shattered. I had believed that if I just cared enough about singing, my dreams would come true. I was wrong.The next morning, I Googled \\'how to sing.\\' After a moment\\'s thought, I edited my search to \\'how to sing well.\\' I clicked the first YouTube video that appeared, took notes, and moved on to the next. And the next. And the next. When I finally stopped, it was dark outside.I started a regimen. I sat at my piano for hours, playing a single note over and over again to practice matching pitch. I stared at my mouth in the mirror and formed vowel sounds. I sang vocal warm ups in school hallways instead of belting \\'I Will Always Love You\\' (to my peers\\' relief). For the first time, I started to understand that passion means nothing without hard work to support it.A year later, I waited with a dozen strangers in the chorus room. An unfamiliar man flung the door open and strode in. \\'Welcome to the Highlands Belles,\\' he said with passion. \\'This is going to change your lives.\\'It did. A cappella taught me the power of sisterhood when those twelve strangers became my best friends. When life tried to drown me, a cappella became my raft. I discovered how music can make a difference when I sang about bullying and stared into the eyes of a crying girl in the audience. Perhaps most importantly, I learned to walk the fine line between blindly following my passion and collapsing under the weight of criticism. Today, I take what is useful from the criticism and let go of the rest. My hard work has finally paid off \\\\u2014 when I step on stage and find my happy place, I now hear cheers.\"}, {\"index\": 132, \"new_personal_statement\": \"There is something about that look I yearn for: eyes widening, the whole body shifts back momentarily before hunching over the paper, and the pencil begins scratching with new understanding. As long as I can remember, I\\'ve been the \\'smart\\' kid in my groups of friends. Need help with math? Go see Mertz; he can help you!Nothing matches the feeling of providing help for a friend, or even a stranger. Perhaps it\\'s because I\\'ve grown up with an engineering mindset from my family, and see problems as situations needing solutions. Assisting someone to resolve his or her misunderstanding provides me a sense of purpose.Throughout my adolescence, however, I\\'ve grown to see informal tutoring as more than an exclusively academic activity. I have bonded with some of my best friends by helping them with schoolwork. The setting of tutoring is so simple\\\\u2014a quiet space with few distractions\\\\u2014making it ideal for building strong friendships. Having a thoughtful conversation is rare nowadays, as many relationships are superficial and consist of gossip or sharing funny videos on Instagram. Contrary to a party, providing support offers a source of meaningful connection and helps reveal true character. I can see quickly who wants to spend the time learning, and who simply wants me to do the problem for them.This summer at pre-season football camp, one of my teammates was taking a summer Pre-Calculus course and he needed help with his homework; I had been friends with him since freshman year. School isn\\'t his first priority, but he is a gifted athlete who wants to play in college. When he called me into his room at 11 PM, I was worried. Each day began with a 7 AM practice, and I almost wished I could do the work for him; I needed to get to bed. He insisted, however, on learning the material, and gradually my mood improved. By 1 AM, the work was done, the concepts were understood, and I had a whole new relationship and respect for my friend.Tutoring has also opened my mind up to new perspectives and ways of learning. I\\'m an auditory learner, and I can easily absorb information through a lecture. That is how I used to help people: simply memorize what the teacher said and spew it to whomever needed to listen. If my classmates didn\\'t understand, \\'rinse and repeat.\\' During the summer between my sophomore and junior years, I tutored students in math and chemistry through Cranbrook\\'s Horizons Upward Bound program three times a week. After trying to explain combinations and permutations to one boy for almost fifteen minutes, I had an epiphany. If simply explaining something was the best way to get my point across, the kid would have already understood the concept in class. With this new realization, I cut up some paper and drew different shapes on each piece. Five minutes later, I saw that look I desired. The rest of the week, I saw him pull out theshapes whenever he had a problem to do, and he even started to show his friends how to use his technique.On the surface, tutoring can seem simple: sharing knowledge with others both sounds and can be basic. However, the brain is possibly the most complex object that exists; spending time connecting with each individual and finding out what makes his or her mind tick is when I can create substantial relationships and appreciate differing perspectives. Perhaps through my participation in team sports, where I have never been the superstar, I know the value in everyone\\'s effort. I then take this insight and apply it to the scholastic setting, where I enjoy collaborating and recognizing the worth of everyone\\'s opinion. Some people lead best through inspirational words and messages, commanding attention from a vast group of people, but I\\'ve found my value in helping others thrive through providing quiet support.\"}, {\"index\": 133, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The pitch-black alley reeked of filth, sweat, and pee. Curiously, I watched my father as he handed a sweater to the homeless man near my house. Once we hurried back to the car, I began mentally questioning why my dad helped him. I had always been told that helping others is good, but I wondered if it truly is moral\\\\u2014would giving Homeless Man a sweater actually help or would it foster laziness? Growing up in a household with two parents working stable jobs, I thought that everyone could provide for themselves, and those who don\\'t are lazy. I asked my father why he gave Homeless Man a sweater when he could\\'ve worked for one. He responded by asking me what I would do if I were homeless and unable to work despite trying. Unable to fully comprehend his question, my moral dilemma was not solved.It wasn\\'t until I was selected as the clarinet section leader in my school\\'s marching band that I could fully understand the nature of my father\\'s question. One of my section members, Gigi, repeatedly \\'forgot\\' to bring a reed. I soon found out that she didn\\'t forget her reed\\\\u2014she didn\\'t have one. Her father lost his job and could not buy her any. Learning this struck a chord\\\\u2014I realized that people can\\'t always control their situation, and in those moments having compassion would help tremendously, not foster laziness. Seeing the morality in helping others, I gave Gigi half of my reeds, offered to practice with her, and promised myself I would be more compassionate.I don\\'t really know how much I helped Gigi (and others), though, but I do know that striving to be compassionate has helped me a lot. Aside from giving me those satisfied smiles I feel in my heart, learning to accept others allows me to accept myself. Since childhood, I\\'ve felt embarrassed of who I am; after all, I\\'m that weird Mexican kid who plays accordion and has teachers as parents. But after talking to more and more people, I\\'m finding that there\\'s less and less to be embarrassed about. One of my Muslim friends taught me that everybody has their own little quirks, and it\\'ll make me a lot happier embracing them. Now employing this philosophy, I\\'m becoming more accepting of and content with myself, sometimes even using the fact that I play accordion as a conversation starter.Along with accepting myself, I\\'ve become a more confident person. One of the biggest challenges that I faced as a student was public speaking; I was that kid whose hand would tremble and voice would quiver with every uttered word. But when I began tutoring at my school\\'s writing center, my public-speaking problem began to fade. Understanding the adjustment struggle from eighth-grade English to ninth-grade Honors English allowed me to speak to the underclassmen with ease and comfort. Getting to help when it wasn\\'t all about me helped me develop self-confidence that extends far beyond public speaking. I in turn began participating more in class (maybe even too much) and became more involved in school.Striving to be compassionate has also helped me become more daring. In becoming more understanding of challenges, I\\'ve learned that challenges allow people to grow. I now seek to challenge myself in every way possible\\\\u2014intellectually by considering contrarian viewpoints in subjects ranging from ethics to literature, academically by taking the hardest classes in every subject, and socially by breaking out of my shy shell to interact with others.As I enter the next stage in my life, I will continue holding compassion for others, whether it be for Homeless Man, Depressed Friend, Abused Woman, or the kid who needs a pencil. College will undoubtedly present me with much adversity, but by continuing to be daring, I will face it confidently and enthusiastically, growing with each and every challenge that stands in my way.The word \\'creativity\\' used to confuse me. It was a familiar yet distant construct that I could never quite put my finger on. It wasn\\'t until I composed my own song in Mr. S\\'s accordion class that I figured out what it is. After I had achieved the \\'mastery\\' level of playing, Mr. S asked me to create my own song. At an utter loss for ideas and inspiration, I \\'frankensteined\\' a bunch of old songs together and showed it to him. Mr. S threw the composition away and told me it wasn\\'t me. I was to write another song and somehow transmit myself through it. When I arrived home, I sat at my desk, closed my eyes, and thought of my favorite memory-a day spent at the pool with my family. As I recounted the events, the music popped into my head. I wrote a rather simple song, but in that simplicity lay my playful memories, fun conversations, and laughs. When I showed it to Mr. S, he called it a \\'creative, whimsical piece of music\\'. When he used the word \\'creative\\', he struck a chord. At that moment, I found my definition of creativity: it\\'s not about making the most abstract or intricate piece, nor is it about coming up with the cleverest rhythms; it\\'s about transmitting myself and my ideas in a meaningful and genuine way. Since then, I\\'ve turned to accordion composing and performing to express my creativity. It is through the bittersweet chord progressions, flying arpeggios, and menacing runs that I pour out my soul. In letting my soul, emotions, and ideas control my fingers and compositions, I get to understand myself and my feelings. \\'It\\'s impractical! It\\'s for boring old people!\\' I\\'ve heard these things about philosophy my whole life. Naturally, my inquisitive nature urged me to see how terrible philosophy is; I looked for a book by Plato\\\\u2014the only philosopher I knew\\\\u2014and selected the one with the unpronounceable title: The Euthyphro.Only\\\\u2026in reading it, I loved it. The way Socrates dismantled concepts to show how little we understand whetted my appetite for more. I soon became obsessed with the Pre-Socratics, the men who laid the foundation for western thought. Their courage to break free from the traditional mythological explanations of natural phenomena is truly exciting. In a time when concrete answers about the natural world didn\\'t exist, they sought to discover and create their own. The Pre-Socratics\\' determination to find out more about the world motivates me to learn more about their philosophical teachings and beliefs. This past summer I took a Coursera class on Ancient/Pre-Socratic philosophy and loved every minute of it. Learning about the visionary ideas on change and existence held by Heraclitus and Parmenides (respectively) gave me new, riveting ways to view the world. Such theories inspired me to create \\'PhilosophyisPhun!\\', a project/program in which I attempt to bridge the disconnect between students and philosophy by painting philosophers to be celebrities (i.e. Socrates could be Morgan Freeman). I\\'m currently working on developing a website and curriculum, with plans of the program coming into fruition next year. In creating content for \\'PhilosophyisPhun!\\', I hope to share the Pre-Socratics\\' wealth of knowledge and ambition with others and continue exploring my fascination with the courageous men who laid the foundation for western thought. Music has always been a big hobby of mine. Whether it was being a member in Mr. S\\'s accordion class or the bass clarinetist in Ms. K\\'s middle school concert band, I cherished playing music with my friends. To my sadness, upon entering my high school\\'s marching band, I learned that it had concluded a season full of problems. At every practice and competition, I noted the toll that the low scores of the previous year and absence of leadership took. We developed a culture that lacked morale and dignity, and our results reflected that. Before the start of the next season\\\\u2014my sophomore year\\\\u2014I was selected to be the clarinet section leader and vowed to help change the culture of the band. At the leadership meeting before the first practice, I brought-up the issue of the self-defeating culture of the band. We determined that we would individually address the issue with our sections. I decided that I would lead by expressing my passion for music and the program, figuring that if my section saw my passion it would rub off on them. As I became more overtly driven, enthusiastic at practices, and supportive of my section, I noticed that my section enjoyed band more and tried harder. Along with my different approach to band, I tried to show that I was happy being there. My section, in turn, followed suit. By the end of the season, there was a notable change in culture. Because of the combined effort of the leaders, we now saw ourselves as hard-workers producing a good show. With that change in attitude came a change in results\\\\u2014we ended the season by moving up a division. The road to this achievement was not easy by any means, but it did teach me two valuable lessons. The responsiveness of my section showed me that setting a positive example is inspiring and necessary because it pushes others to improve. I also learned that leaders aren\\'t those who yell and command; true leaders are passionate about what they do and empower others to achieve excellence while having fun. I come from a long lineage of field-laborers and farm hands. My grandparents from my mother\\'s side were once braceros and my father\\'s parents (and him for a brief period) worked in the fields of Mexico. This is a community that I was born into and hold deeply to my heart. During the winter break of my eighth-grade year, my father took me on a trip to visit my family in Las Parritas, a small pueblo in Sinaloa. As I arrived, I was greeted by never-ending rows of maize. My cousins showed me around and took me to the fields where they worked in the summer. For the short while I was there, I had a lot of fun helping them with menial field work such as picking dead crops off the floor. When I returned two years later, I helped my cousins in a far different way. From my previous visit, I noticed the lack of opportunity present at the pueblo. To help open more opportunities for my cousins I started to teach them (and help an uncle who was taking a class) basic English words and phrases. Though my time at the pueblo was again limited, I didn\\'t stop after I left. I still communicate with my family through WhatsApp and Facebook to help them learn and practice English. My father and grandparents worked incredibly hard in the fields to make sure that I would never have to, giving me my way of life. My way of giving back to this community is by helping my cousins who are still working in the fields learn English. I will continue contributing in this way and hope to eventually get more English-speaking family members on board to help my cousins learn. \"}, {\"index\": 134, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Oh, no sweetie, you are a people person. You come in here every day all bright and smiley, and you talk with literally everyone.\\' I stared blankly at Maria while another coworker nodded his head, agreeing. How could Maria ever think I was one of those mythical \\'people people\\', who floated through social circles like tiny butterfly ballerinas? Then I realized: Maria, and everyone else in that lab, only know me as I am today, not as I was just years ago.In part of my mind, I\\'m still who I was freshman year. The girl who had to pause and consider how to respond to a casual greeting in the halls out of fear of giving the \\'wrong\\' answer, or who mentally rehearsed what she was about to say three times, only to be talked over in a group. Sure, part of my social ineptitude was because I had just moved to Alabama and didn\\'t understand the social dynamics, but the bigger problem was that after spending half my life with the same kids, I just didn\\'t know how to deal with new social situations. I had to realize that I\\'m simply not that person anymore.Change often doesn\\'t come all at once, and it certainly didn\\'t for me. First, I had to understand that repeatedly Googling \\'how to make yourself more personable\\' and \\'how to be charismatic\\' wasn\\'t actually going to help. I had to put myself \\'out there\\', wherever \\'there\\' was.The first good \\'there\\' I found was at a Saturday bioinformatics seminar, during lunch. Following everyone\\'s nerd stereotypes, our conversations were stilted at best. Naturally, by which I mean in a maneuver that I had never attempted before and was utterly terrified to do, I tasked myself with starting a conversation. I won\\'t lie and tell you that we instantly and painlessly had a vibrant, flowing conversation, but I can say that we ended up as the only table in the room to be heard laughing.And so it went, until \\'there\\' became a pretty fun place. I stopped pacing the halls at lunchtime alone and started walking around with friends until I never had to feel excluded at school again. But as I\\'ve said, you don\\'t just wake up metamorphosed into a people person; you keep vestiges of your former self. So keeping Uncle Ben\\'s famous warning in mind, I made sure not to waste my newfound people person powers by making sure to help those around me- like my chemistry tutee, Sara. She had just moved to Birmingham and had many of the same problems that I used to, so I became her social tutor too. While I couldn\\'t snap my fingers and instantly make everything better for her, I could help her deal with high school\\'s infamous social scene.\\'Honestly, Elise,\\' Sara said to me once as we were leaving our favorite bookstore, \\'I don\\'t know how you ever made friends here. It\\'s impossible!\\' \\'Well,\\' I replied, \\'It wasn\\'t overnight, but what helped me the most was just being aggressively nice. Smiling at everyone, lending everyone paper, always offering to help, things like that.\\'\\'Oh, thanks for the door!\\' I said with a big smile as someone held the door open for us. Then I saw who it was. It was Hugh, the most popular Senior guy and Student Government president when I was a Sophomore.\\'Wait, Hugh?\\' I exclaimed. He stared. One. Two. Three. Then he gasped.\\'Elise?? I honestly didn\\'t even recognize you!\\' Well, that was pretty obvious. It made me smile-- I was such a different person from the shy, introverted me in Sophomore year. I had truly become a new person-- a people person. I guess Maria was right after all.I like to joke that I\\'m making up for the Halloweens I lost to hurricanes and freak October ice storms with my love of costume making, or as those in the community call it, \\'cosplay\\'. I stumbled across the cosplay community around eighth grade and I was instantly taken with the idea. Dressing up in the cool, outlandish clothes I saw in my favorite video games and TV shows sounded amazing to my younger self, and it still is. The only problem was that no one in my family knew how to sew. My first \\'costume\\' was a hooded cloak that I patterned and constructed through lots \\\\u2014seriously, lots\\\\u2014 of trial and error and hours spent hand-sewing. And although my back was throbbing and my fingers were riddles with pinpricks by the end of it, I was hooked. From there, my costumes grew increasingly more complex. I taught myself how to embroider and use a sewing machine, both skills I used to make my Supergirl costume for Halloween last year. I also upcycled an old pair of riding boots into bright red costume boots using acetone and spray paint. This year\\'s Halloween costume is even more complicated: Dungeons & Dragons characters. I\\'ve learned to make chainmaille, work with leather, and my favorite, use EVA foam and thermoplastics to make faux-armor. I\\'m beginning to incorporate 3D printing into some of my costumes, like making Sansa Stark\\'s necklace from Game of Thrones. There\\'s something addictive about wearing your hours of hard work like a badge of honor, and seeing your creations get better and increasingly more complicated throughout the years is an amazing feeling.As much as I love the sciences, I\\'m also a major linguistic nerd. I\\'ve never actually had a formal linguistics class, but I\\'ve found ways to learn more wherever I can. I\\'ve fallen down research rabbit holes about things like the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and the development of the so-called \\'accentless\\' American accent. Whenever I could, I turned academic work into a linguistic conduit. I turned an assignment on the development of Southern culture into an essay on the creation of African American Vernacular English, and I wrote a term paper on the linguistic nuances in Beowulf. There, I began working outside of my language with Old English and ended with my favorite paper of any English class. I continued my linguistic momentum, rewriting a large section of another term paper to include the effects of the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation on the German language, which was so fascinating despite the fact that I would struggle to order a glass of water in German. I discovered that I absolutely love other languages, both to speak them and to just know more about them. Hearing the differences between the myriad Spanish dialects is one of my favorite games, and the often-humorous changed meaning of words in different Spanish speaking places. Living and learning in Cuba was especially fascinating to me because I got to hear the differences between my father\\'s Americanized Cuban accent and that of a Cuban citizen. Despite its virtual uselessness, I absolutely loved my Finnish classes in Tampere. Finnish is in Uralic language family, and virtually unrelated to any neighboring Indo-European or Slavic languages.It has so many interesting features, like having 13 different cases, vowel harmony, and my favorite, an extensive word-changing system. Just as Spanish has stem-changing verbs, Finnish words change based on their last consonant and the preceding letter. More than anything, I loved seeing the patterns between completely unrelated languages, and that\\'s what drives my love of linguistics. To me, loving linguistics makes just as much sense as loving science; both are just ways make connections that I would never have found otherwise. I was painfully introverted in my Freshman year. I would pause and consider how to respond to a casual greeting in the halls out of fear of giving the \\'wrong\\' answer, or who mentally rehearsed what she was about to say three times, only to be talked over in a group. Sure, part of my social ineptitude was because I had just moved to Alabama and didn\\'t understand the social dynamics, but the bigger problem was that after spending half my life with the same kids, I just didn\\'t know how to deal with new social situations.I had to learn that just repeatedly Googling \\'how to make yourself more personable\\' and \\'how to be charismatic\\' wasn\\'t actually going to help. I had to put myself \\'out there\\', wherever \\'there\\' was. And it turns out that the first good \\'there\\' I found was at a Johns Hopkins CTY seminar at UC Berkeley! Following everyone\\'s nerd stereotypes, our conversations were stilted at best. Naturally, by which I mean in a maneuver that I had never attempted before and was utterly terrified to do, I tasked myself with starting a conversation. I won\\'t lie and tell you that we instantly and painlessly had a vibrant, flowing conversation, but I can say that we ended up as the only table in the room to be heard laughing. And so it went, until \\'there\\' became a pretty fun place. Of course, it wasn\\'t overnight, but one of the things that helped me the most was just being aggressively nice. Smiling at everyone, saying \\'Hi\\' first, always offering to help, so on and so forth. I managed to make a great group of friends despite my initial shyness and struggles to adjust, and more importantly, I learned to come out of my shell and how to navigate even the least familiar of social situations.I moved from Connecticut to Alabama just before I started freshman year. Besides the major culture shock between New England and the Deep South, I had to adjust to my new school with its own long-standing traditions and culture. To make things even more confusing for me, the school runs from fifth through twelfth grade, so everyone already knew each other and had set their friend groups.Naturally, when I was thinking about a Birmingham-focused community service project for my school\\'s leadership organization, I immediately knew that I should use my experiences being \\'the new kid\\' to help make this transition easier for all of the new kids who come after me. After extensive conversations with my advisor, the Head of the Lower School, and the Head of the Upper School, I devised a new and comprehensive New Student Orientation. My program explained my school\\'s traditions, the oft-mentioned Honor Code and Honor Court, and the ridiculously confusing schedule. I designed, printed, and posted flyers outside each faculty member\\'s door with their picture and a few fun facts about them so no teacher would seem too unapproachable, and I recruited other students in the middle school leadership program and various upper school service clubs to help guide new students throughout Orientation Day. My program included things like class registration, lockers, schedule, extracurriculars, and traditions. My Orientation program has been in place for the past two years, and I\\'ve heard only good things from new students I interviewed later in the school year. I\\'ve arranged for it to continue operating under the guidance of the Student Government Association once I graduate. Besides the formal Orientation, I also try to help new students whenever I can. Last year, I took a new student from San Francisco under my wing and tutored her extensively, both in academics and the school\\'s social dynamics. It was gratifying for both of us to be able to relate to each other\\'s struggles transitioning into the Deep South, and it was as nice for me to give her advice and hear just how much I had truly learned as it was for her to hear it. \"}, {\"index\": 135, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The trilobite perched on the shelf in an unassuming swirl of Paleozoic mystique, imprinted with the memories oftumultuous ancient seas. Nearby, a yellow-flecked, rubberized lizard flopped pathetically next to a rigid plastictiger, whose painted eyes seemed permanently appalled at the state of the surrounding classroom. This unlikelymenagerie lurked in the background of my thoughts, a fascination in its complexity and a threat in the unknown itsymbolized. Every morning when I entered my 5th grade class, I would watch as a plucky classmatedeconstructed and then reassembled the work of centuries. The work of a universe was swiftly reduced to child\\'splay; the unsteady hands of a child stood in for the hands of God.These plastic replicas were as real to me as the classmates who inhabited the elementary jungle. Each morning Ipadded tentatively through the halls teeming with bright yet insensitive visages of youth. My school, the school forthe laissez-faire, the budding philosopher and the free spirit. Teachers fancied themselves the next Socratesesand Platos, uttering philosophical musings from cross legged positions in the midst of circles of less-than-focusedpupils. Taking advantage of the absence of any discernible curriculum, I spent the entire fifth grade pouring overthe 232 pages of the Cambridge fifth edition Latin textbook with highly realistic plans to become fluent in Latin andmove to Rome before the age of 11. Clearly, the fact that a dead language wasn\\'t actually spoken anywherehadn\\'t fully sunk in yet.I entered high school fascinated by the prospect of a structured public education. Math class every day?\\' Ithought, \\'That\\'s strange.\\' I approached classes with the same wide-eyed wonder as before, eager to learneverything set before me. Even classes like \\'Literacy in the 21st Century\\' excited me (and subsequentlydisappointed me when they turned out to be entire semesters of personality quizzes. Yes, I know I\\'m introverted.No, that doesn\\'t mean I\\'m destined for a career in Law).

By 11th grade, I wasexceedingly frustrated by the limited curricular pick-a-path my school provided. I was a fish out of water, strugglingagainst a current that had never existed before. With my school offering less than a quarter of IB\\'s course catalogand no AP\\'s, the choice came down to studying the computer science and economics that I love or earning an IBdiploma. With the same determination as my younger, Latin-devoted self, I decided to forge my own path. Secondsemester of junior year, I enrolled in eight IB courses while self-studying four AP courses and teaching myselfcomputer app coding. While my 12 classes seemed ridiculous to some, it gave me a sense of relief in knowing mycourse load had become my oyster.Just like hyperactive children had rearranged the orderly trilobite and Australopithecus years before, a rigid systemhad tried to predetermine my path in high school. Instead of surrendering in the claws of what seemed out of mycontrol like the spineless dollar-store lizard had, I held steady. The freedom to ceaselessly pursue intellectualgrowth is invaluable and we should never be too afraid to step away from the beaten path to find it. The barriersthat obstruct boundless learning are merely someone else\\'s conception; I wasn\\'t afraid to step around them andcreate my own path into the unknown.\"}, {\"index\": 136, \"new_personal_statement\": \"November 2016:It was dark, curly, and nothing dared to tame it-so bold, yet beautiful.

As my mom informed me about prominent African-Americans such as Madam C.J. Walker, I couldn\\'t help but feel proud. Given the lack of useful hair products for black women, Walker had the courage to address and meet a need.

In fact, she had hair just like mine. She immediately took out her phone to show me a picture.\\'Are you sure?\\' I asked surprised.\\'Of course!\\' She smiled.When she opened the picture, I was amazed to see that her hair was indeed similar to mine: tight curls and a coarse texture. As she told me how she admired me wearing my natural hair, I explained to her how I respected her determination to wear her hijab. Though Layla and I are of different ethnicities and religions, we both understood how hair, whether covered or uncovered, meant more than mere follicles. Wearing my natural hair symbolized an acceptance of both my cultural and personal identity.As I look back, I realize that this is a lifelong journey.

I could nod as my teacher explained concepts on the board and faced the floor in shame as my mother scolded me for breaking her lamp, but I could never respond; I could listen, but was unable to interact.After one week of silence, I was signed up for a speech evaluation. The brick walls were suffocating, but I was too immersed in Percy Jackson\\'s misadventures in Camp Half-Blood to care. As I looked up from the novel, I saw kids talking to their parents and yelling with their friends. I could not escape the nagging truth: I was an anomaly - not like the children in the room nor those in the novel clutched in my callous hands.Upon hearing the secretary call my name, I entered the examination room with optimism. However, rounds of doctors shoved tongue depressors down my throat, nurses forced clamped jaws open, and counselors used sweets as weapons of coercion, shattering my buoyancy. As the speech pathologist entered, I braced myself for further prying. To my surprise, I was met with a gentle, \\'Hello.\\'Despite the kind gesture, the words felt like daggers piercing my soul. My heart beat out of my chest as my mind searched for a response. My pulse rang in my ears and the pressure spread through my body. Even after thinking up a response, my stomach cramped and my mouth refused to budge. At this point, my parents were pulled aside to discuss alternative solutions.From that day onward, group speech therapy took the place of my lunch period. The idea of trading PB&Js; for staring at others in silence seemed impractical, after all I tried every therapy under the sun and nothing yielded success. What would make this different? Nonetheless, I entered the speech counselor\\'s office and took a seat alongside two other students.Our first task was to introduce ourselves. Initially, we made efforts to say our names, with varying levels of success. Ultimately, we realized that a nonverbal approach would be more efficient, so we each wrote our names on a sheet of paper and shared it.From nonverbal communication we moved on to gesturing, mouthing, eye contact, and producing sound, forging the path towards vocalization. Within three weeks, I had my first interaction with my teachers. In the span of two months, I was having brief conversations with my classmates. Our final assignment for group therapy was to introduce ourselves (this time with words), a reflection of the progress we had made.There was one more hurdle to pass: developing my voice - in all the time I was silent, I never thought about what I would do with my newfound voice. I feared that if I didn\\'t use it, someone would use it for me.While I dipped my toes into different outlets, my parents and peers pushed me to deliver a speeches or sing in school concerts. Regardless of the intent, others were seizing my voice and suppressing the person behind it - the very thing I feared. Not knowing what to do, I chose to use my voice to lead, so I took the first steps and directed a class discussion.From class discussions, I moved on to group projects and clubs in high school. Today, I am 40% diligent student, 40% teenage angst, and 30% silent child of the past - giving 110% every step of the way. My dreams range from becoming Secretary of Energy to the head doctor of a medical practice.

After all, I\\'ve overcome adversity my whole life, just ask my therapist.\"}, {\"index\": 138, \"new_personal_statement\": \"2012 MATHCOUNTS SPRINT ROUND. As I stared at my first MathCounts practice test, my seventh grade mind begged for more sleep. After plowing through thirty monotonous quadratic factorizations assigned as algebra homework the previous night, I dreaded more math, let alone waking up at 6:30 for a MathCounts practice. Little did I know, this forty minute contest math test would spark a passion in mathematics that would change my life.Contest math questions were unique because the solutions were simple to comprehend, but extremely difficult to produce. To solve the problems, I needed a deep, intuitive understanding of many math topics because the solutions applied basic formulas and concepts in clever and inventive ways. I thoroughly enjoyed this, as it forced me to problem solve. Unlike many school tests in which I could quickly confirm I could answer all the questions, I knew I wouldn\\'t be able to answer many problems on a contest math test. The joy in taking these tests came from the analytical process and mystery of the outcome, as it was more engaging to work on a problem I knew I might not solve.  To begin these problems, I would first notice patterns, test smaller versions, and brainstorm possible solutions.Many of my approaches failed, but some inspired other approaches, which sometimes led to a solution. When I conquered these questions, I felt powerful, because I had logically thought through a demanding problem. Even when I failed to decipher the problem, I was enlightened by the innovative solutions. I tried to grasp the motivations behind each step, and give myself a more rigorous understanding of the topic.Although contest math has pushed me to extensively study mathematics independently, I believe that the greatest growth and learning comes when collaborating with fellow passionate students. However, in my hometown of Marion, Iowa, the most popular interests are Hawkeye football, Cyclone football, and high school football. There are only a few students that I can discuss problems with and spur on each other\\'s enthusiasm for mathematics.To further my interest in mathematics and work with talented students from around the country, I attended the AwesomeMath summer camp at UT Dallas after my sophomore year. During AwesomeMath, I learned more about mathematics than I ever could have imagined, with topics ranging from excircles to diophantine equations. More importantly, I loved that my growth was largely attributed to collaboration with my fellow classmates. Because almost all of the problems interweaved multiple subfields of mathematics, we cooperatively solved many complex math problems, with each of us bringing our unique natural strength to the problem. Alex from Canada was the geometry guru, Anna from Florida was the trig tyrant, Steven from Utah was the algebra eXpert, and I was the combinatorics king. Through our teamwork, we conquered a myriad of problems that we could probably never solve alone. In addition, we became better problem solvers by explaining to each other clever motivations contained in our mathematical strength.Furthermore, mathematics led to friendships outside the classroom. Although discussing problem fourteen on the 2008 AIME is not typical \\'small talk\\', our common interest in mathematics led us to converse about our shared hobbies such as chess, tennis, and Fun Run. As time went on, our shared passion for mathematics and mutual interests led to extremely strong friendships. Even today, I still discuss mathematics and converse with many of the friends I met at math camp.Contest mathematics made me realize that there\\'s much more to mathematics than what I\\'ve encountered in most high school classrooms, requiring rote memorization and numerous calculations. Furthermore, the creativity of contest math problems and solutions allowed me to go beyond the classroom and energized me to be truly passionate about mathematics. Lastly, collaborating on mathematics with fellow devoted students nationwide has allowed me to absorb more information than I ever could alone, and above all, has produced lasting friendships.  During my freshman year, my friends and I would always rendezvous in the orchestra room after school. This provided an occasion to discuss the daily progress (or lack thereof) on our crushes, funny moments of the day, and anything else we wished. The orchestra room was unique because it contained a series of small, smelly, and poorly maintained rooms fondly referred to as the \\'backrooms\\'. We accessed the \\'backrooms\\' by going through a large steel door in the back of the orchestra, which was our version of the wardrobe in The Chronicles of Narnia. The backrooms contained a computer connected to deafening speakers, which allowed us to have loud, passionate, karaoke sessions to songs such as \\'Written in the Stars\\', by Tinie Tempah. One particular day, my friends and I were feeling especially creative. With the homecoming dance on the horizon, we decided to make a simple love song for a friend, John Low. John had a crush on a viola player named Bryce Jones. If John\\'s wishes could come true and they could get married, her name would be Bryce Low. Obviously, the title \\'Bryce Low\\', was far too revealing, so we created the rhyme \\'Rice Dough\\' as a substitute. During the next few hours, we created an innovative love song. My friend Caleb was the lead singer, while my friend Daniel and I, who were less vocally inclined, contributed some cello instrumentals.\\'Rice Dough\\' was the first of many musical inspirations. Throughout our high school career, we\\'ve created birthday parodies of popular songs such as \\'Shape of You\\', prom proposals, and funny breakup songs to cheer people up. The music making process was special for us personally because it allowed us to share a moment or story with others in an engaging way. Furthermore, as close friends, bouncing off thoughts and improving each other\\'s ideas was an enjoyable challenge that bonded us together. Although I express my creativity by making music, it is more importantly a tool that can forge strong friendships. Throughout my high school career, I have loved using the restroom. For most, a bathroom break provides a well-timed break from class and a chance to fulfill basic needs. For me, a trip to the restroom is much more. As I look down at the urinal, I can see the conversion that one gallon is equivalent to 3.8 liters. Through my many years of observation, I have ingrained this fact in my brain. I find it interesting that although everybody has seen this statement thousands of times in their life, a vast majority probably don\\'t even know the units, let alone the numbers. Although I understand that it is a useless conversion that has no practical value, I consider it as an opportunity to activate my mind instead of mindlessly walking through my surroundings.  As I exit from the restroom, the sinks provide another opportunity for me to critically think. Through my observations, I have concluded that the majority of sinks are poorly designed for their purpose, hygiene. Many sinks require a handle, forcing the user to infect the handle as they turn on the sink. After the user has cleansed their hands through washing, they are immediately infected by the handle as they turn off the sink. Amplifying the problem, many restrooms have automated hand dryers. This prevents a well-prepared restroom goer to prepare paper towels beforehand to turn off the sink. Finally, many old buildings have inconsiderately made the door a push from the outside and a pull from the inside. If they have not done so already, this forces consumers to contaminate their hands on the door handle. Although it is an incredibly ordinary event, I approach my daily trips to the restroom like anything else in my life, with thoughtful and diligent thinking. In my opinion, my greatest skill is the ability to carefully observe and analyze everything around me. \"}, {\"index\": 139, \"new_personal_statement\": \"My stomach painfully twists as I sit in the van driving back from my mission trip to Eagle Pass. This has happened to me before. It won\\'t last more than a week. The next two and half weeks proved me wrong. The pain intensified as the days passed, and every time I tried to eat, it made me more aware of the pain. \\'Pierce, we need to go to the hospital.\\' Before I knew it, I was in a hospital bed with an IV in my arm. My vision faded and I woke up several hours later. \\'After reviewing the test results, it is clear that you have Crohn\\'s Disease.\\' My heart dropped.Both my parents suspected that I had an inflammatory bowel problem. I had done my research and I knew there was no cure for Crohn\\'s. I thought that my week could not get any worse.Three days later I received a call from my father telling me that I needed to accompany him to the hospital. My grandmother, who had been battling illnesses for months, was going to die. She had moved to Houston shortly before I was born to be closer to my mother. As we stood with her in the cold hospital room, memories of the times when she would pick me up from school came flooding back. She was a retired teacher and routinely helped me with my homework and sparked my interest in science. She died later that night.My diagnosis and the loss of my grandmother could not have come at a more challenging time during my junior year. I was a member of the first Strake Jesuit Public Forum Debate team to attend the national Tournament of Champions (TOC), and AP exams would be taking place in just over a month. I missed about two weeks of school during my Crohn\\'s flare-up, so I was swamped with makeup work.Everyone faces obstacles, and I told myself that while my disease and circumstances may have left me weak, I wouldn\\'t give up. I knew I could be just as determined as my grandmother, who battled illnesses, countless broken bones, and underwent more surgeries than I can remember. I put all my energy into recovery and my determination and hard work paid off. My debate partner and I finished the TOC with a positive record, I scored 19/20 on my combined AP exams, and I maintained straight A\\'s in all my courses. After eight months, I no longer have pain and can manage my disease with medication. Moreover, I am confident that I can overcome difficult obstacles and help others do the same.I always wanted to be a doctor but never saw myself as a patient. My experience has been edifying. After seeing many different doctors and having a multitude of tests, I saw the complexity of our health care system and appreciate the need for simplicity and coordination as a care provider. I think that doctors need to see beyond the specific disease and understand the other issues that are happening with the patient. For me, I want to be more patient-centered and less disease-centered when I hopefully enter the world of medicine.I also developed a better understanding of the steep costs that come from medical care. While we could pay for my care, I realized that many families go bankrupt due to medical expenses. I founded a 501(c)(3) charity, the American Medical Debt Relief Foundation, and currently serve as President. My organization raises funds to forgive medical debt owed by people all over the country. Since inception, we have abolished about $3 million in medical debt, ensuring that these patients can focus on recovery and not repayment. I\\'m not happy that I have this illness, but I\\'m able to use it positively to be a better person and advocate.I spent the majority of my time after school, every weekend during the school year, and several weeks each summer debating. I chose debate because I wanted to further my academic interests beyond what I could learn in the classroom. It was important to me to learn more about what was going on in the world. The experience has been invaluable for several reasons. I learned how to handle defeat. During my freshman year, my partner and I competed on the varsity team and found that competing against seniors was very difficult. Despite this, we tried different strategies in rounds, had practice rounds against the seniors on our team almost every day, and just kept doing as much research as we could. That year, and the following two years, I was awarded the honor for the best public forum debater at Strake Jesuit. I have learned how to work collaboratively. Summers at debate camp gave me the opportunity to work with debaters from across the country with different backgrounds and experiences. I formed bonds with people over a common interest in the issues that face not only our nation, but the entire world. The lessons that I have taken from that novel cooperation and the friends that I made are still some of my most important memories. By sophomore year, my partner Daniel and I were serving as the captain of both varsity and junior varsity teams. We won our first tournament and qualified for the state championship. We kept up the hard work, spent another summer at debate camp in Boston, and junior year we qualified for the exclusive, national Tournament of Champions (the collection of the best teams in the US). Debate also gave me a chance to be a teacher. Now in our senior year, we have taken the Strake Jesuit Public Forum Team from a group that struggled to qualify members for the state tournament to a team that regularly receives several qualifying bids to the Tournament of Champions at every competition we attend. Daniel and I have come a long way since our freshman year and we are ranked 5th in the nation (as of 01/09/18).The skills central to success in debate: analyzing data, using it to create cogent arguments, being able to express myself clearly, and thinking on my feet are the same skills that will be central to my success in the future. These skills will facilitate my efforts to reduce disparities and inequities through medicine and policy.\"}, {\"index\": 140, \"new_personal_statement\": \"It is not too often you board a plane flying 10,000 miles away from home. If you do, it is most likely a luxurious overseas vacation. I, however, was not going on vacation, nor to a very luxurious location. In fact, for the next five years following 2009, California would no longer be my home. Rather, my home would become a country unlike anywhere I had ever been: Armenia.The 2008 global financial crisis took my parents\\' family business and house, leaving them unemployed and with nowhere else to turn. In a desperate attempt to provide for me and my brothers who were in college, my parents decided to return to their home country of Armenia. Saying goodbye to friends at school, my house, my brothers, and my life in America, I embarked on a life-changing challenge. Arriving in Armenia, I saw nothing to like about it; dark, unnamed, and poorly maintained streets; passengers overpacked in small vans that supposedly served as public transportation; dilapidated buildings built during the Soviet era; extreme poverty. At my new Armenian school, classes were only taught in Armenian and Russian, leaving my monolingual English-speaking self unable to communicate. Barely understanding the languages, I turned to my teacher for help. Every day after school, while other students played and spent time with their friends, I stayed with my teacher to expand my knowledge of Armenian and Russian. Initially, my grades suffered due to my limited linguistic capabilities, but practice indeed made perfect. I mastered the new languages, and used them in everyday conversations both in and out of school. By eighth grade, I was a straight-A student whom my Armenian peers turned to for help with schoolwork.But language was not the only barrier I came across. Coming from the suburbs of a first-world country, I was initially displeased with my new environment in Armenia. Most people only had one outfit; some could not afford firewood to keep their homes warm during cold winters, and others could not even afford sending their children to school. My attitude changed when I met my relatives who lived this destitute lifestyle. When I met my cousins Arthur and Edgar, I questioned how they had fun without the \\'essentials\\': the Internet, a phone or iPod, or at least a gaming console! All they had was their imagination, sense of adventure, and a soccer ball. It was only when I abandoned my reliance on the material goods that I had the most enjoyable years of my life. My cousins and I spent our time making whistles from apricot seeds (trust me, it works), climbing the apple tree in their backyard to see who would harvest the most apples in five minutes, playing a clumsy version of soccer in an alleyway while envisioning ourselves as legendary soccer players\\\\u2026 The list goes on. Only when I let go of my dependence on material objects and goods that I felt were necessary for fun was I able to fully experience the sheer joy of appreciating what I had. Although 2014 marked the end of my life in Armenia, the lessons I learned influence me to this day. Reflecting on my experience, I accept that something positive can always be derived from a negative situation. Had my parents not lost their house and jobs, I would have grown up in a large suburban house, ignorant to a life in which the material didn\\'t matter so much. I would not have undergone the pain of my family\\'s losing everything and being evicted. I would never have gone to Armenia. I would never have learned two new languages. I would never have learned to create excitement and adventure, and thrive in situations with limited resources; I would never have had the resiliency and drive that I carry with me today. But because I have, because I did, and because I endured, I am who I am today.When I began volunteering at Lake Avenue Community Foundation - a nonprofit in the city of Pasadena that offers mentoring and enrichment programs for children- I was able to achieve my desire of helping many children in my community become more comfortable with and engaged in learning. The children I tutor at this organization come from low-income backgrounds or are children of first-generation immigrants. They lack the opportunities that would make learning much easier for them as it does for their other peers. Serving as a mentor for these students, I teach them how to stay on task and focused on their responsibilities and assignments, so they can prepare for their transition into high school. I also help each child individually with any subject they have been struggling on at school, or with simple homework problems. Because education, along with my community, is one of my greatest values, I have set a goal to help at least one child excel in one of their classes at school and begin to love that subject by the end of the school year. To achieve my goal, I have helped the students find more effective study methods and given them access to resources that helped me excel in school subjects, especially when enrolling in high school after being in a different country for many years prior. I also teach rather than give answers to the students. For instance, instead of simply giving them the answer to a math problem, I show them how to reach the solution with step-by-step explanations, so they can later solve such problems on their own. My excitement has grown fonder as more of the children I tutor have excitedly shown me their improved report card grades and better understanding of what they learn. I hope to continue leaving a mark on these children by helping them overcome educational barriers and teaching them that dedication and hard work can help them face and overcome challenges, and that they too will soon enough become the teachers, doctors, actors, or other future leaders to sprout from our community.A factor I attribute my academic achievements to is the first challenge I faced that was a barrier to my education: a new school in a different country, where everyone speaks a different language than my own.When my parents and I moved to Armenia in 2009, I was forced to attend an Armenian school where classes were taught in Armenian and Russian, instead of English. With my minimal knowledge of Armenian, I barely understood the lessons and realized that it was not going to get any easier for me unless I began learning the languages somehow.My teacher noticed my struggle to comprehend what was going on in class, and offered to teach me both languages. I decided to take her up on her offer. Every day after school, while other students spent time with their friends, I stayed with my teacher to expand my little knowledge of Armenian and Russian. Initially, my grades were poor due to my limited linguistic capabilities, but practice makes perfect. I mastered two new languages, and used them in everyday conversations with family and friends, and at school. At the end of the school year, I was fairly caught up with my classmates, and my linguistic abilities continuously improved by the end of eighth grade. Overcoming linguistic barriers has given me resiliency and confidence to tackle recent obstacles, as well. After living in Armenia since the 4th grade, I returned to the U.S. to begin high school with my underdeveloped English. Although I was intimidated by my peers who had received an American middle school education, I did not let that be an impediment to my own academic growth. Since freshman year, I signed up to take the most advanced courses offered at my school, which in turn made my academic experience thrilling and competitive. As I was forced to develop the study habits, work ethic and will power to help me catch up to my peers, the challenging courses eventually became much easier and enjoyable to me, while also serving as a bridge to my academic achievements at school.I have been drawn to the nervous system since learning about it in my middle school anatomy class. Since then, I have continued learning more about the brain from independent study, volunteering at a pharmacy, and eventually enrolling in my favorite class that focuses greatly on the brain: AP Psychology. Before learning psychology, I gained some basic background knowledge about the brain by studying it through research outside of class, focusing on the numerous diseases people suffer from relating to it (along with their causes, effects on behavior, and their possible treatments). When I began volunteering in a pharmacy to gain sense of what working in the medical field would feel like, I learned much about the effects of different types of medicine on the brain. As I labeled prescriptions, one of the pharmacists I worked with explained to me how the specific drugs I was labelling react with the brain to temporarily relieve depression, insomnia, or pain. My fundamental knowledge from independent study and shadowing at the pharmacy inspired me to enroll in my psychology class, where I currently learn about the science behind behavior and thought as it relates to the brain. I enjoy learning psychology because it furthers my knowledge about the brain and allows me to analyze and understand the biological reasons behind people\\'s actions, including my own. Psychology also kindles my admiration for the brain as it teaches me the immense power of a single organ to shape one\\'s character while also serving as the motherboard of the human body. As I continued to learn more about illnesses of the brain in AP Psychology, and how certain medications may control or cure those illnesses, I became increasingly interested in studying the biological basis of mental phenomena and neurological disorders. My interests have inspired me to major in neuroscience, giving me the opportunity to then invest my education in research to uncover more causes of neurological disorders, more effective treatments, and ways to prevent them.My admiration had reached a point beyond the ability of YouTube tutorials to satisfy. Fascinated by piano, I had desperately convinced my parents to enroll me in a music school, where my passion intensified. Being about five years older than my musical peers made catching up one of the biggest challenges. I risked potentially disappointing myself and my parents, and facing humiliation in case piano became nothing more than a failed pursuit for me. However, it was a risk worth taking, motivating me to do what seemed impossible to my parents, teacher, peers, and even to myself. So that I could begin playing the first song that sparked my interest - \\'Fur Elise\\' by Beethoven - I begged my piano teacher to skip the mandatory basic piano lessons. I was aware of the impediments and massive dedication I needed to achieve my goal. Nevertheless, no obstacle and no amount of work could stop me from fulfilling my tremendous musical desire. Noticing my ambition and enthusiasm, my teacher agreed to the perilous change in curriculum, and we began our daily, advanced, and fast-paced lessons. Gazing at the complicated musical notations that looked like hieroglyphics to me, I reminded myself, \\'I can and will do this.\\' Quickly familiarizing myself with musical notes, I began to play the song piece by piece. Soon, I affixed those pieces with hours of daily (and sometimes nightly) practice. Uninterrupted hours of sitting at the piano and repeatedly playing arpeggios and perfecting every chord did more than cause severe back pains; in only two months, I performed \\'Fur Elise\\' in front of an audience at my first concert. Sacrificing hours and days, facing frustration and disappointment all finally led to the achievement of my long-term goal and desire, which I would finally be able to share with a crowd of music enthusiasts. In the following three years, I caught up and surpassed other piano students my age, performing at multiple concerts, playing songs that would typically not be suitable or realistic for a three-year piano student. Piano remains a beloved pastime for me. I continued independently playing and practicing even after finishing music school. Currently teaching piano and music theory in my free time, I share my passion with others, establishing valuable relationships with music devotees. Moreover, I often express my emotions through impromptu compositions of my own, or play to relax after a long day.It is more than a hobby. My experience with piano helped and inspired me to withstand the academic rigor of numerous advanced classes I have enrolled in throughout my high school career. As dedicated to my grades as I was to piano, I accept every challenge and devote as much time and effort as necessary to do my best, instead of being intimidated by any amount or difficulty of coursework. Playing piano has revealed a side of myself that I have longed to discover for years. I now see every hindrance as an opportunity to grow and to work for what I desire.Growing up in a Christian family, I have always believed in God. I followed my parents\\'routine of going to Church every Sunday morning and saying my prayers before I eat, sleep, ordo anything important throughout the day. As I grew older, however, the idea of God made meincreasingly nervous. I wanted to have a place in God\\'s Kingdom but knew I was unworthy dueto my sins. Though my life was going great \\\\u2013 my family was happy, my grades were thriving,and I had amazing friends, there seemed to be an emptiness in my heart caused by the doubt thatGod will ever truly love me or accept me.It was not until my first Bible Study session that the emptiness in my heart filled. Threeyears ago, on a cold Thursday afternoon, my best friend invited me to attend a Bible Studysession with her at her Church. I expected it to be just like any other Bible Study I have attended.Little did I know this would be the Bible Study session to make my relationship with Christpersonal. When we arrived at the Church, I was warmly welcomed by other people my age andleaders that were delighted to see me join them that evening, and the session began. The studyfocused on the verse in Jeremiah 1:5, \\'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before youwere born I set you apart. I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.\\' After the leader read theverse, he asked everyone in the room who has ever sinned to raise their hands \\\\u2013 everyone,including him, raised their hands. I looked around and realized that I was not alone, but the versestood true for us all. The leader then asked everyone whom God loves to raise their hands. \\'Iwant to see everyone raise their hands because God loves every single one of you,\\' he said. Themessage struck me with a sudden burst of energy and warmth. I felt Christ\\'s presence in theroom. I realized that Christ knew me before I did, or before my parents did \\\\u2013 before I evenexisted. He knew my imperfections, who I would grow up to be, and all the mistakes I wouldmake down the road. He knew I would commit sins and there would be times I go against hiswill\\\\u2026 yet he died for me and forgave me. The study session ended with my renewed faith inGod and my strengthened relationship with Christ that I will forever cherish.Since that day, I have come to enjoy the Bible studies held by my Church as theycontinue to give me guidance and allow me to share my love for Christ with others. I hope toshare my experience with my future peers at Vanguard and create or join Bible study groups thatwill help others and fuel my life spiritually as I continue my walk with Christ.\"}, {\"index\": 141, \"new_personal_statement\": \"People stared quizzically at me as I loitered around the batting cages with my breadboards, circuit wires, and a microcontroller. My eighth grade self didn\\'t let their antagonistic looks deter me from achieving my goal of designing a baseball helmet safer than one of a billion dollar company. So, I decided to launch a 60 mile per hour fastball to test my haphazardly built prototype. The electrical devices testing the impact to the brain revealed nothing\\\\u2026 The baseball destroyed all the equipment. This experiment revealed one important thing. No it\\'s not that people shouldn\\'t launch baseballs at fragile equipment (definitely true, though!), but that I needed a mentor if I wanted to conduct meaningful research relating to neurodegenerative disorders. Witnessing trauma injuries and the effects of Alzheimer\\'s has motivated me from a young age to determine how we can protect the brain. Thus, months searching for possible computational biology internships and just plain praying yielded my dream job. I was finally employed as an image processing researcher at Brain Health Alliance, a nonprofit organization that develops software applications to combat Alzheimer\\'s. Unlike cancer or other diseases that have made breakthroughs this century, Alzheimer\\'s continues to ruthlessly tear apart the brains of millions of people. But before I could do actual research, I needed to develop my fundamentals. My mentor assigned me a \\'warm-up\\' project of creating a computer interface displaying brain scans. I thought the task of converting brain data into images would be simple, but it turned into an arduous three week adventure with minefields at every step. My first attempt was a success, that is, if you consider looking at images with the same quality as your 1970s television a success. However, 160 hours of hard work later, I finally finished the project to an acceptable quality. A project already completed in Alzheimer\\'s research. But one that taught me more about computer science than any of my classes and showed me why brain visualization is important in diagnosing and treating Alzheimer\\'s. Now, two years later, I devote the majority of my free time to my work at Brain Health Alliance. I don\\'t just tolerate the long twelve hour summer days or the late nights spent conducting research, I live for them. Even if my research has a 0.01% chance of leading to a breakthrough, I know the time I sacrificed will be well worth the reward for the millions of families suffering from Alzheimer\\'s. My dogged persistence in contributing effectively to my image processing group, primarily made up of PhD students and college undergraduates, pushes me to carve my own research identity by spending hours writing code, creating novel methods, and finding meaningful results.My scientific research in visualization can be divided into two areas: volume rendering and co-registration.   Volume rendering is the process of viewing brain scans as 3D objects. I contributed to the first software application allowing users to view brain scans in commercial virtual reality devices, such as the Oculus Rift. This prototype software provides a more natural visualization when compared to standard techniques and can be used in surgical simulations. Co-registration, a medical procedure used in clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer\\'s, aligns different brain scans. I conducted multiple computational experiments comparing the accuracy of existing co-registration algorithms.   Now, after being a first-author on three conference presentations and co-authoring two publications in these two fields of research, I lead a project, in which my three colleagues and I are developing an algorithm allowing physicians to simultaneously view the functional and structural attributes of a brain. This project isn\\'t a cure.However, successful implementation could expedite diagnosis and research of Alzheimer\\'s. More importantly, this project is the first opportunity for me to express my creativity in designing real world solutions. I\\'ve matured considerably from my baseball debacle. I now understand the necessity for mentors and teams to move an idea from conception to reality.For 3 billion people, basic internet access and safe water are not guaranteed. Computer science and programming inspires me to think about why we have situations like this and how we can fix them. Last spring, I developed a software image processing application, Clean Future, that allows people in third-world countries to determine whether their water is clean. While researching this prevalent issue, I learned about the technology discrepancy present in our world. Building a website or app was out of the question because only a small minority of people in developing nations have internet or smartphones. In fact, the only form of contact for most is a cell phone with two functions: calling and texting. To solve this problem, I created a method to send automated text messages that received pictures of water, sent results from back-end algorithms, and connected to non-profit foundations. I aim to release this product in the future to help those struggling with water remediation. This gap between those who have technology and those that don\\'t pervades the way I think about computer science. I imagine how creative artificial intelligence algorithms can be used to predict conflict or political strife in war-torn countries or if a set of machine learning methods could be utilized to model the success of resource supply chains in developing nations. Innovation should no longer be limited to benefiting isolated, resource-rich countries. I want to use my subject knowledge in computer science to create integrative solutions that can incrementally alleviate this inequality. However, I don\\'t want to limit myself to only developing projects individually. Inspired by Clean Future and the programming community, I am currently organizing a hackathon, where other high school students can build their own projects to combat problems important to them. Although the details have not been finalized yet, we plan to include special prizes for projects that tackle relevant issues like climate change and healthcare access. I have seen dozens of computer science applications. But that is only the beginning. I look forward to learning more about computer science at the University of California.DIRE SITUATION: DORM ROOM + ROOMMATE NEEDED (Craigslist Ads -- Stanford)Tried commuting from San Jose.

ACCESS DENIED!This large message jumped up onto my screen as I tried to access an Alzheimer\\'s brain scan database. Multiple days spent trying to find a workaround were ultimately futile in finding a solution. I decided to express this frustration in an unconventional place: debate. Debate is meaningful to me as it allows me to bring attention to important scientific problems often overlooked by mainstream media.  Issues such as data accessibility and standardization not only affect me, but undermine the efficiency of millions of researchers.Our topic last year was about United States-China diplomatic engagement; rather than debating about obvious issues like trade, military drills, or cyber attacks, I was able to convince my team to debate about researcher collaboration over data sharing and standardization policies. Not only would scientists in two parts of the world have access to important data, but partnering over a non-contentious issue would improve relations. Our unique plan was well received by hundreds of opponents and judges and was e-mailed to government officials about its feasibility. It is still up for consideration. Debate is ultimately a testing ground for ideas I want to see implemented by our government. Combined with my interest in STEM, debate has motivated me to think about interdisciplinary solutions that can help solve scientific dilemmas, while alleviating our society\\'s political problems at the same time. More importantly, it has provided me a voice for combating issues that are important to me. \"}, {\"index\": 142, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Whiskey, Waffle House, and JesusI stepped up to the podium, adjusted the microphone, and looked out. Thousands of judging eyes looked back. Okay, I thought, you only live once. Reserved for ceremonies and announcements, the McCallie School Chapel in Chattanooga, Tennessee was anything but controversial.\\'Hey, y\\'all. I\\'m starting a Young Socialists Club.\\'Silence. Despite countless debate tournaments, Model United Nations conferences, and oration contests, my confidence dwindled. I felt as though I\\'d been thrown overboard in a storm. No matter how I tried crawling back onto the deck of my boat, a never-ending series of towering waves kept slamming me back down to a pool of dark, foamy water and sucking me beneath the surface. I was just starting my speech about political diversity when I heard clapping. Then cheers. Soon, the entire student body was chanting: \\'Trey! Trey! Trey!\\' Maybe I didn\\'t live in Trumpland, after all; Donald\\'s election was only a bad dream!Okay, that\\'s not what happened. Instead, my announcement was met with cricket-chirping silence, followed by muffled laughter and boos. And instead of a firm handshake and way-to-take-initiative-son type comment, I was met with an eyebrow-furrowing frown. A teacher yanked me aside as I walked off stage. \\'You had no right to do that, son,\\' he said.Similar scenes have characterized my life in the South. I\\'ve lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Lookout Mountain, Georgia, Norfolk, Virginia, and Fort Worth, Texas. From organizing a socialist club to spending senior year in \\'job-stealing\\' China, my decisions have caused many eyes back home to roll.My relationship with the South has been complicated. Because my father is a vascular surgeon, his work and conference invitations enabled my family to travel inside and outside the United States. My mother also saved every dollar so she could show my brother, sister, and I the world. By freshman year, I had lived in thirteen houses, ranging from the banks of the Tennessee River to the cobblestone streets of Antwerp, Belgium. I had ridden trains across Western Europe, studied Mandarin and Chinese culture in Beijing, and done humanitarian work in rural Cuba. These experiences created a point of comparison that rendered me insecure of my Southern heritage.It\\'s no secret that the South is the most uneducated part of America \\\\u2013 nowhere else is football valued more than academics. Nowhere else do people attend snake-handling churches. Drive down the highway running through my hometown and you\\'ll notice three billboards: the first advertises whiskey, the second Waffle House, and the third Jesus. (Another advertises Bradford Health Services, a drug and alcohol rehab facility, but we don\\'t talk about that here.) I was raised in an environment where people laugh at stay-at-home dads. I was raised in an environment where the endowment of the all-boys high school is double that of the all-girls high school, and \\'I\\'m With Her\\' signs are stolen from \\'un-American\\' yards.I was confronted by the dilemma of my cultural identity: I could embrace it in the name of conformity, or jettison a connection I thought would limit my chances to succeed. I chose the latter; I skipped Friday night football games, researched colleges thousands of miles away, and even attempted losing my Southern accent.I now realize that my harsh judgment of Southern culture was unjustified, hypocritical, and divisive. In reality, problems exist within every society. People deserve respect regardless of their accent, heritage, or political stance. By neglecting the positive qualities of the South, such as its strong sense of individuality and family values, I embodied the very intolerance and closed-mindedness I criticized. Life in the South has taught me that meaningful change is achieved not through an all-or-nothing mentality, but through mutual respect, understanding, and compromise.I eventually renamed my organization the \\'Young Progressives Club\\' to be more inclusive. Although it wasn\\'t enough to convince any Trump supporters to join, they stopped booing my chapel announcements.\"}, {\"index\": 143, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Here\\'s how we make tamales in my family.First, imagine an assembly line. Now, imagine that the line is not a line at all but a criss-cross of paths weaving across a kitchen island in a house within an Arizona subdivision. Next, imagine that even the paths can change over time (depending upon which uncle is taking a break, which cousin is taking over, etc.) such that the assembly line metaphor itself dissolves and ceases to be useful at all.Now, in that context, the first person flattens the rinsed corn husks (ribbier side down) onto a square of wax paper, and applies a relatively thin layer of masa in a curved pattern near the center of the fan-shaped husk. Arc-shaped margins are typically left along the upper and bottom edges. These margins might be missing, however, if the first person is distracted by/is the source of whatever loud, non-tamale-related discussion is taking place at the moment.This is a pardonable offense.Lifting the wax paper carefully by the edges, the first person passes the husk to the next person, who applies the filling (generally, red chili pork) and slides the subassembly over to the most important person of all \\\\u2014 the olive- placer (full disclosure: me, in many cases).The olive-placer has the arduous task of placing the olive on the chili. Of course, only a rookie would place the olive in the direct center. It must be placed approximately on-third of the way down from the top. For what reason, I don\\'t know. If the masa supply is nearing its end, go ahead and include two olives, because what else are you going to do with a Costco-sized jar of olives? Finally, before steaming, the entire package is folded together in a manner that apparently needs to be relearned every year, and may be accompanied by a fair amount of argument between veteran team members.At this point you might be picturing an idyllic Mexican family working together to make a traditional holiday meal.You would be (mostly) wrong. In fact, it is my Chinese grandmother (I call her \\'popo\\') who dispenses the chili with a giant spoon while standing on a footstool, whose unlikely height (five inches max) seems designed for nothing more than allowing an Asian woman to reach into a giant pot of chili. Popo also acts as drill instructor, Department of Weights and Measures, and quality control (see above discussion on folding method).So, while I am indeed a quarter Mexican, the preparation of tamales is primarily driven by the Chinese side of the family, working together with my Mexican grandfather (who preps and cooks the chili meat), and further involving a number of my very white relatives, including my father. In short, in the drop-down menu of life (and college application forms), I\\'m ethnically part of the \\'pick all that apply\\' generation.Despite what goes on around us, we still make the tamales. White supremacy cannot destroy erase past; bigots in power who would have shut out my ancestors cannot destroy what we have now; even the miscegenation laws that prohibited my grandpa and popo from marrying could not destroy their dreams.I place the olive as an act of rebellion; one-third of the way from the top.Numbers are everywhere. As a result of the modern process of teaching math, with its focus on the method rather than the uses, students can often have a disconnect between the beauty of nature, and the power of numbers. I\\'m not talking about the way the SAT has subjected students to \\'6 bushels of corn for 5 dollars each, 2 acres of land for 10 dollars, find the intersection\\' and similar trivialities that suck the magic out of numbers and mathematics.I became enthralled with numbers in 7th grade when I attended Barrett Summer Scholars, a program for middle schoolers at Arizona State University. Everyone takes two courses during the week, and I got my third choice: The Beauty of Mathematics (my top two were Archeology and Astronomy). As a consequence, I wasn\\'t very pumped for the class. But the topics in it were so different from any math class I had prior that it sparked something in me. The most interesting concept I learned was the golden ratio and how it relates to nature. I had never even thought to look at the way a shell wraps around itself in a numerical sense. Before this, Fibonacci numbers were an oddity that I never connected to anything until I was shown how they relate to the golden ratio, which connects to the Parthenon, which connects to the human form, which connects to phi and irrational numbers and everything else.During the last year, I\\'ve made a more concentrated effort to learn more about math. As a result, I\\'m taking both Statistics and Calculus III/Differential Equations my Senior year. To supplement this, I\\'ve also found a host of interesting math-related YouTube channels like Mathologer, \\'3blue 1brown,\\' and Numberphile to keep my interest going. From these teachers I\\'ve gained a better understanding of the world that cannot be confined to rows of numbers and symbols marching across straight notebook lines; instead, I\\'ve learned about the form and order of shapes, the nature of imaginary digits, and the boundaries of infinity.There is a surprising amount of technique required to properly strike a piece of wood with a plastic mallet whose end is surrounded in a tight ball of twine. In my percussion classes, I\\'ve only had the title of a \\'leader\\' since my senior year, but nonetheless, I\\'ve tried my best to positively affect the program despite lacking a formal mandate to do so. The main way I\\'ve done this is by tutoring people to play percussion, focusing on mallet instruments, so that they can receive improved placements next year in marching band. Solos are personally enthralling; they are an expression of the skills one has acquired throughout the year, leading my percussion teacher to use it as a benchmark for where a person should be placed next marching band season.One of my best friends, Thomas, was a freshman last year, and he asked me to help him through this process so that he could score a top instrument. As such, I taught him a moderate-difficulty piece called \\'Gitano,\\' which is Spanish for \\'Gypsy.\\' For about five months we had lessons, from January to May, because he was anxious and wanted to learn it as best as possible. Thus, I aided him with every aspect of the piece, going through the octaves in the hands, to the polyrhythms created by separate musical forces, and how one needs to be fiery and active when playing the piece. After playing his solo for our teacher, there was a sense of emptiness waiting to be filled with instrument results; Thomas was stricken with doubt and kept remarking that he had bombed the audition, destined to play a sub-par instrument next season. A whole month passed before the results arrived, and I remember being as excited as Thomas when I saw that he got on 3rd marimba, a major feat for a sophomore. By being a leader and a teacher, I become connected to my pupils (who in this setting are my friends), creating an atmosphere of benevolence and kindness between the entire group.Hitting things in time.There\\'s been a lurking version of percussion always in my life, whether it was when I was a toddler playing with a Fisher-Price plastic xylophone with tiny mallets, or when I didn\\'t want to take piano lessons anymore and began bashing the keys of my Casio keyboard because there were too many notes-per-chord for my 3rd grader self to be pleased. Luckily, in 4th grade, my elementary school had a program entitled \\'Mallet Masters,\\' which was a percussion ensemble filled with a bunch of marimbas. Oddly enough, an audition was required to get into the group (a taste of audition anxiety at a young age), but once I was accepted my outlook shifted on music. All the songs were learned by rote, but I still enjoyed the process of learning.I discontinued percussion (formally) during middle school because I decided I wanted something new, and switched to Cello in the orchestra. What a mistake; I was never content and didn\\'t play very well because I had no drive to practice. As a result, I switched into the band my 8th grade year, and found that middle school band was just as dreary. Luckily, I was working with an outside teacher at the time that kept my enthusiasm for the instrument growing.High school is where my love of percussion flourished. I joined marching band -- specifically, the front ensemble -- which allowed me to revel in the qualities of marimba and mallet instruments. I found friends within the percussion program, and began practicing at the orders of my private teacher every day to become the best. My Fisher-Price keyboard, all bright neon colors and squeaky wheels, was dragged around my house every day when I learned how to walk; and thus, I act now, dragging my instruments onto grassy fields in front of bright lights to a crowd of apathetic high schoolers and devoted parents of band students.To exist is to be vibration.At the base level of physics is the formula E=mc2, which expresses the equivalence of mass converted to energy, in the form of a wave. In this interpretation, one can see that everything we are, everything we ever do, and everything that has ever been can be seen as an intersection of waves, an ocean of sine and cosine rippling against the shore of infinity. Thus, when presented with this viewpoint, I cannot help but see the world as music, from the ground up.Since I was young, I\\'ve been composing; my dad had a program on his computer called Finale PrintMusic, a less advanced version of the Finale program that I use today. I used to compose for my tiny bell set I had in 1st grade, with one song being called \\'My cat is cute!\\' and another \\'Bell bell bell.\\' In essence, I\\'ve always been trying to translate my experiences into a musical form. In other words, I express creativity by stacking together musical ideas into something worth listening to.Recently, I went to a program for high schoolers interested in composition at the Cleveland Institute of Music. When I was there, I got a look into the lives of other composers, and how it would work trying to make a living out of the craft. What I saw was depressing. I tasted a general atmosphere of desperation and stress, with people constantly trying to beat out some new piece, one more rhythm, another melody in perfect form to try to get noticed. This went against everything I have done when I compose. I want to use composition to process what is happening to me and how I am feeling, not have to produce empty, capitalism-driven music to survive. I use composition for myself, and for that reason I rarely show my works to others. In a world bent on projecting yourself onto the internet and getting others approval, my compositions allow me to process myself, for myself.\"}, {\"index\": 144, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Did you not hear or did you not listen?\\' My partner\\'s words echoed in my mind. In truth I did not listen. I thought I knew better. After all, it had been on my shoulders. I was the one who had to win the debate. It was my speech.When all was said and done, the choices were mine and the loss mine. Except that it was not only mine. My decision meant that my partner would end the last tournament of his debate career in failure. One of his last memories of debating with me would forever be tainted.Striding away from the room, away from the building, I walked into the arms of close friends. As I collapsed into a chair and contemplated the loss, they consoled me as I attempted to reflect on my mistakes.I still had to debate round seven.The thought of forcing myself to speak again paralyzed me. Would the very last round of my partner\\'s senior year be a loss? Would it be my fault again?In that moment of questioning myself, I could barely muster up the strength to find the will to debate. Yet, surrounded by energetic debaters, I could not resist the temptation to compete again. As I found myself balancing on the cliff, ready to collapse, I discovered a newfound energy within myself. I thought about why I debate: the adrenaline, the critical thinking, the camaraderie. Then, the prospect of debating another round was no longer daunting.We won that round seven. Though it did not alter our ranking at the tournament enough, at least we ended our year on a high note. Choosing to debate in the final round instead of conceding was an emotionally taxing decision. Overcoming this challenge, not the prospect of winning another round, reinvigorated my spirit. As I debated beside my partner in our last round, I realized we relied on a community of individuals to support us.Every step of the way, my partner, coach, and friends supported me. After our fateful loss, I found the will to stand back up.As my community coalesced around me after our loss, I knew I was not alone. At any moment, I can ask for help and dozens of willing hands would come to my aid. In my folly, we lost because I felt in control and deliberately ignored my coach\\'s advice. Yet, I chose to radically depart from the previous ideal of myself and, for once, accept the help of others.Despite letting down my partner, I decided to continue debating into my senior year. I felt a desire to give back to the community which had given me so much. By debating again, I could act as the stabilizing presence for friends and younger debaters. I could help them overcome the challenges I have faced, and we could face new ones together.I find joy by seeking challenges, experiencing the full range of what life can offer. Right now, I live through my debates. I confront each challenge head on and never back down, especially after a loss. Waking up the morning of a debate tournament and seeking new trials is where I am content. At the same time, I am happiest connecting with other people and finding the common humanity between us. I help others, as I was helped. Every opportunity we have to take a small step together, towards success and towards growth, is invaluable.This sense of community, of fidelity towards one another, is what I will seek to find as I move onto the new challenges life brings me. After this year, I will still have my friends from debate, but our common activity ends with high school. As I move forward, I will seek out new communities, new activities, and new commonalities to build networks of success, because I know that way, we can weather any storm.\\'Hey, what book should I read?\\'As the school\\'s resident bibliophile, I am asked this question on a daily basis. I walk the hallways with a book in hand and people stop to ask. I feel myself breaking into a smile as I channel my inner Ollivander from Harry Potter. I shuffle around the collection of books that is my brain, looking for the perfect story to match each individual. As Ollivander measures Harry to find his wand, I too ask numerous questions about their interests. Eventually, I make a final choice, displaying my understanding of someone through a book.I was horrible at doling out book suggestions to my friends. I would consistently miss the target, not fully understanding what they wanted.Yet, I learned to improve. By constantly reading, I broadened my horizons. I began to appreciate the subtle differences between literature from different cultures and times. In turn, the quality of my suggestions improved dramatically. I could tailor a specific recommendation to my friend, lighting up their day as they delved happily into a new book. In my years of reading, I never would have thought that my love for literature would manifest like this. However, as I cultivate relationships with many different people, I appreciate the value of this unique talent. Recommending a book is profoundly intimate. I must understand a person and apply that to every book I have ever read. I must interrogate everything I know about this individual to break down their preferences, ultimately returning a singular answer. Even more, every book I recommend feels like a referendum on me. The act of recommending a book shares something deeply personal about me. By revealing my favorite books, I am subtly showing an often hidden side of myself to others. Their judgments of the book often have biting implications on their perceptions of me. This action creates a unique bond between two individuals and I relish every opportunity to use my expertise to share the joy of literature with others. As everyone got their wand from Ollivander, everyone gets their books from me. \"}, {\"index\": 145, \"new_personal_statement\": \"/ //V /a |/tFeel PhysicsFRESHMAN YEAR, INTERATIVO HIGH SCHOOL, VOLTA REDONDA - BRAZILMonday morning, 7 am - Physics class.\\'There\\'s a trick\\', my friend says. \\'You draw a triangle, put velocity on the top, acceleration on the left side, and time on the right side. Now, put your finger on a variable and... voila\\\\u0300. You have its formula! That\\'s how you resolve the 30 problem sets.\\'Physics was easy. And boring. How was it supposed to be interesting if it was more about remembering formulas than launching rockets and observing planets? I could calculate the trajectory of a projectile sent from the top of Mount Everest, but I had never launched a small rocket from my backyard. I could calculate the voltage of a drawn electric circuit, but I couldn\\'t even light a bulb with a battery and wire. I got all A\\'s on my exams, but, ironically, I felt like I didn\\'t really know physics.SENIOR YEAR, TWINFIELD UNION SCHOOL, PLAINFIELD - VTMonday morning, 9 am - Physics class.\\'Hey guys, what do you want to investigate today?\\', said Charlie Wanzer, my Physics teacher during my year-long exchange program in Vermont. As opposed to tons of concepts and formulas copied from the textbook, Mr. Wanzer\\'s class was 100% based on experiments and self-learning. As he declared multiple times, he wanted the students to take on a bigger role in their education. After determining the investigation of the day, we would open up our computers, research, and, afterward, we would have a class discussion or experiment.We built and launched rockets that crossed the soccer field; we went on night field-trips to the observatory; and we even built a huge solar reflector that, unfortunately, didn\\'t gather enough heat to boil water. For a Brazilian student who was used to copying what the teacher wrote on the whiteboard and solving problem sets for homework, it was mind-blowing! After working for hours wiring and coding an electronic circuit, and trying and failing more times than I could count, finally seeing the LED go on or the motor spinning was absolutely fascinating.I found in Mr. Wanzer\\'s class the solution to my long-known problem of boring science education. However, now I also recognize the importance of the solid theoretical and mathematical base that I developed at my school in Brazil. Nonetheless, experiments and investigation must still be the central point in building an understanding of physical phenomena.I was finally able to test this solution tutoring other high school students. Earlier in the year, I brought a student to the city park where we analyzed the interaction between sloths, plants, microorganisms, and the environment. That was Ecology I and II with no hypothetical problem sets to solve. Another time, we divided the length of the circumference by the diameter of CDs, vinyl discs, and rolls of tape to understand how the magic number pi appears in nature. Whenever I am able to get those shiny eyes from one of my students, I feel a shiver down my spine and I know that I am doing the right thing: spreading real science.Even though I have been teaching a variety of subjects, I can\\'t stop dreaming about my future as a Physics teacher. As Walter Lewin said, \\'I\\'m going to make my students see beyond the equation, beyond the concepts. I will show them, whether they like it or not, that Physics is beautiful.\\'In my classroom, I won\\'t tell my students about the laws of inertia; I will put them on a bus and hit the brakes really hard - while wearing seatbelts, of course. I could even tell them how gravity works, but, first, I\\'ll have them throw bowling balls from the top of a building. I won\\'t have them know physics; I\\'ll make them feel it.\"}, {\"index\": 146, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Twelve one-hundred freestyle on a one-minute thirty interval. On the top!\\' shouts my coach.I frantically swim to the back of Lane 1. My heart races. I had never swum a hundred (yards) free on a one-minute thirty interval before. I watch as everyone lines up before me, leaving me disappointedly and embarrassingly last in the lane. When I started swimming competitively, I naively assumed that becoming the fastest swimmer on the team would be easy because I was confident in my abilities. But after my first swim practice, I realized, as I died swimming the first lap of the set, that I, in fact, sucked. And that was just the warm-up.My ego was hurt. For those two hours, it didn\\'t feel like I was swimming through water, but rather trudging through thick mud. But no matter how much I was like a cat in the water, I wanted to move my way up to Lane 8, the lane consisting of the fastest, most agile swimmers of the group.I\\'ll admit it -- that first day of practice, I quit multiple times. As everyone else continued swimming, I leaned against the pool wall, desperately attempting to catch my breath. And for that, my coach, Brian, gave me some tough love.\\'Unless I see you black out, there\\'s no excuse for you to stop swimming, no matter how hard the practice set is.\\'Is he serious?! I thought Brian would follow his statement with a light-hearted comment like, \\'Not literally, but you know what I mean,\\' but he just continued to stare at me stoically. Wow...He was serious.With newfound determination, over the span of five years, five times each week, even with my parents\\' concerns over my management of time, I endlessly swam up and down the lanes of that 25-yard-pool, alternating between butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley sets, until it was impossible for my arms and my legs to move. Outside of the pool, Brian\\'s comment echoed in my head, reshaping the dynamics of my life. I swapped a can of soda for a glass of water, a pathetic curl-up for a dignified plank, and a quitter\\'s attitude for a winner\\'s. When I had an extra hour, I would replay Michael Phelps\\' iconic 100 fly Olympic win on Youtube to study his exemplar dolphin kick and arm technique. Needing all the help I could get for my worst stroke (breaststroke), I watched and analyzed Rebecca Soni\\'s world-record breaking 200 Breaststroke Gold-Medal moment in order to emulate her turned-out feet and quick arm pulls.One day at practice, I confidently placed myself in Lane 5.\\'Elaine,\\' called Brian. \\'You\\'re in the wrong lane,\\' he finished as he motioned towards Lane 7.My eyes widened. I hadn\\'t anticipated those words. Though it may not seem like it, Brian had complimented me. I had been waiting for those five words for a long time. It was validation that I was on the right track. Just like my first practice, I watched as everyone lined up before me. But this time, I was contently last in the lane after swimming 2836 miles to get here. While I\\'m still advancing my skill set in Lane 7, I maintain my sights on the neighboring lane - the last lane to cross. Initially, swimming in Lane 1 was hard to accept, but someday, somewhere, I know I will be back in Lane 1 again, whether or not it\\'s in the pool. When I started high school, my mentality was to get straight A\\'s, perfect test scores, and a flawless GPA. Swimming brought me back to reality; I\\'m very aware that I\\'m not perfect and that I won\\'t be number one at everything. Thanks to Brian\\'s advice, though, I never passed out and I never again gave up. Rather, I continue to pursue challenging endeavors as I pave my way towards another Lane 8.\\'Twelve one-hundred freestyle on a one-minute thirty interval!\\' shouts my coach.I frantically swim to the back of Lane 1.

Even with years of arduous experience, I\\'m not the swimmer standing at the top of the podium. But in my eyes, with each day, I see improvement. It mirrors my time spent helping young kids learn how to swim at my local YMCA. These kids work to \\'move up\\' their own lanes. As I watch as them lose their dependency on floaties, I reflect on my own journey from Lane 1 to Lane 7.\\'We are moving to Long Island,\\' my dad told my seven-year-old self. My mouth dropped. No. No. No!For seven years, Plymouth, Michigan was my home. My only home. I went from being enveloped by the girls and boys I knew since our diaper days to being surrounded by foreign faces at a new school.I hated the attention I received as the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018new girl.\\' I remained close-lipped and buried my face to hide how much I hated this new life. Even though I was a member of the class, I was in no way participatory. My teacher noticed my listlessness, which took a toll on my performance in class.That was until I was approached warmly by two girls, Rachel and Hana, who had moved to Long Island three years earlier. We quickly became great friends, putting me at ease. As I grew more comfortable in the community, I warmed up to all my classmates and made new memories in Long Island that I never imagined would have happened.After a year in Long Island, my family and I abruptly moved again to New Jersey.Moving again was tough, but at least I knew what I was in for. Without a doubt, walking into another new school, I felt the urge to crawl back into my shell. However, drawing from my first move, I decided to embrace my once-again new life with an open mind. With growing confidence, I raised my hand more in class and engaged more with my classmates and my teachers. Ultimately, I made the transformation from a hermit to a complete chatterbox. Throughout my high school years, I continued to stay active in class and the community. I learned to adapt to change and now, I am a better person and student because of it. When college comes to mind, I think of my third move and how ready I am for it. Nerves are normal, but I am more excited to meet different people again, explore fresh new places, and commence another new chapter in my life as a student and an individual.The anticipation grew as I logged into my Home Access Center account to check my sophomore year class schedule. Period 9: Honors Chemistry Awesome. Teacher: Jimmy StoneShoot.Don\\'t get me wrong. Before the start of my sophomore year, I was most looking forward to taking Honors Chemistry. I thrived in the sciences. What killed some of my excitement was who I got as my teacher. \\'I hear his tests are super hard. He gives out 10-paged tests that no one finishes, so everyone fails,\\' advised my friend.It was somewhat true. The 10-paged tests were a real thing. But they weren\\'t designed to fail us. We were simply expected to work hard.Undoubtedly, chemistry is a complicated subject. Understanding the nomenclature of compounds and the mechanism behind chemical and redox reactions pushed my intellectual capacity. But, despite the difficulty, there was an overlooked fun to it all. Observing unknown metallic compounds\\' effect on the color of the Bunsen burner flame and hatching a myriad of approaches to determine whether surface area and temperature affect the rate of a reaction highlighted not only discovery, but also team effort. Chemistry piqued my interest and I couldn\\'t let it go.Soon, I decided 40 minutes of chemistry wasn\\'t enough to feed my passion. Every Monday morning, I went to school early for Science League. Sitting in a classroom amongst other potential chemists, I explored chemistry in depth (entropy, molality, quantum theory, etc) outside the set high school curriculum. After witnessing chemistry in the classroom, I followed it outside. As an intern at Alliance Technologies, instead of solving contrived practice problems and following a set procedure amongst a crowd of amateur student chemists, I came face-to-face with real-life, mind-provoking problems from clients and worked alongside avid expert analytical chemists in chemical testing labs, ranging from spectroscopy to microscopy. From handling the assorted stash of glassware to pipetting liquid samples into the viscometer tube to examining pesticide particles through the lens of a polarizing electron microscope, I gained validation to pursue chemistry in the next chapter of my life.\"}, {\"index\": 147, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Wait, what! I was wondering why I ran into you all the time!\\'The sounds of shock, confusion, and astonishment emanated from the mouths of my cross country teammates. After almost three months of attending classes and running together every day, they suddenly found out my darkest secret. No, I did not possess the power of teleportation or Hermione Granger\\'s time turner, but I had something even more powerful: an identical twin. I never tried to keep the existence of Lizzie a secret to anyone. In fact, I was a bit perplexed myself, as they all claimed they had never seen me walking by her side to school or sitting with her at lunch. Yet, I had been unknowingly concealing her identity from the people I spent two hours of practice with every day. Suddenly, my body flooded with shame. Amidst daily conversations and anecdotes about distant cousins and family pets, I never once mentioned her name. They had no knowledge whatsoever about this essential sphere of my life. How could I have failed to tell them about Lizzie? About my sister\\\\u2014my twin sister\\\\u2014my best friend?As I ruminate on my hiccup, I realize I was so ashamed that I never mentioned Lizzie because she plays such an integral role in my identity. Not because of our matching frizzy, blonde hair or our shared DNA\\\\u2014our similarities are not what hold us together. In fact, the most potent force she brings to my life is the drive to recognize and develop my unique capabilities, even in the face of someone supposedly \\'just like me.\\'When we were younger, Lizzie and I did everything together. As we grew up, I struggled to match her successes and began to loathe the semblance we shared. I moped with stringing, skinned knees as she rode past me on her bike with ease. I crawled into a messy top bunk every night as she tucked herself into the meticulously made bed beneath mine. She scored more goals than me in soccer and sight read music effortlessly in church choir while I still struggled to hold scissors properly. It was as though someone removed my faults and shortcomings and made a copy of myself that I could never live up to. I felt more like her shadow than her equal.After wallowing in self-pity and distress, sometime in my middle school years I realized that Lizzie seemed her happiest when she was playing lacrosse, a sport for which I possessed neither the desire or skill to play. Nevertheless, I longed to experience the passion she felt for something of my own. I wanted to practice my collaborative skills, indulge my hunger for competition, and experience the self-growth she was enjoying on her team. And that\\'s when I found running. As I timidly walked into practice on my first day of freshman year, I felt lost and lonely without Lizzie by my side. Slowly, however, I gained confidence and ability in the sport. Every night, I excitedly updated my sister on my latest workouts and race times. Although the terms I babbled meant nothing to her, she matched my enthusiasm and spirit for my progress. Her unconditional support for me allowed me to realize the best version of myself.As I have aged, I have learned how to use our commonalities to compliment and support my individuality. While we aren\\'t straight copies of one another, we do share things like our incredibly immature senses of humor and our voracious passions for waterskiing. The moments of time we spend together from walking down the street to buy dinner to traveling outside the country create inside jokes and poignant memories that I recall with fondness and sincerity every day. The common ground beneath us fosters the steadfastness of our relationship, creating a bond closer than any other I have experienced in my life. My experiences in high school have taught me that having a connection as close as that between Lizzie and me is essential for human growth and development. For every blunder I experience, I know that she is waiting attentively to catch me when I fall. For every misunderstanding and argument, I know there will be an absurd moment of screeching laughter as I lie on the floor of her room thirty minutes later. Her unwavering presence has brought me the comfort and encouragement I need to succeed in all parts of my life during the past four years. Being an identical twin has taught me to defy comparison and to use my sister as support and encouragement instead of constant competition. I know when it is best to be her collaborator, caretaker, or cheerleader, and she knows which role to play for me. I want her to succeed in her personal endeavors as much as she wants me to thrive in my own\\\\u2014it is this element of reciprocity in our relationship that allows it to play such a fundamental role in my life.This year, as I met the newcomers to my cross country team, the first thing I told them was, \\'I\\'m an identical twin.\\' Not because I wanted to spare them of awkward encounters of confusion in the hallway, but because I wanted them to know the most important thing about me. \"}, {\"index\": 148, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Twelve one-hundred freestyle on a one-minute thirty interval!\\' shouts my coach.I frantically swim to the back of Lane 1.

I cried for the ride to stop, screaming louder at each brusque turn as nausea overcame me.And at the age of 14, I squealed at the sight of a millipede briskly running across the bathroom floor just inches away from my bare foot.

I happen to experience fear a little more, but every day, I want to experience it a little less.\"}, {\"index\": 149, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Prompt: Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or familyChildhood ShadowEveryone\\'s childhood tends to combine into streams of blurry memories. I am no different. Through the haziness however, there is one clear memory I have of the first time I truly took interest in something around me. Like other children my age I had fallen into the habit of questioning everything around me, being merciless to my parents, asking whatever questions came to mind. I stood in my front yard, no more than four years old standing at about three and a half feet. Being an only child at the time, I could often cajole my parents into playing whatever game I had my mind set one. That day\\'s choice: tag. The day remained bright and hot but I paid it no mind, too excited that I was going to play my favorite game. As the game preceded nothing out of the ordinary took place, my parents were discreetly letting me win and I was obliviously thinking I had the speed of a superhero, too fast for my parents to catch. It was halfway through the game that I started noticing something strange. I was being followed and whatever was following me was copying everything I did. My curiosity was peeked, so naturally I decided to investigate, unconsciously doing a four year olds version of the scientific method. I began by running around and testing the figure, seeing if it would follow. It did. Then I jumped around, seeing if the thing would jump. It did. At this point my parents noticed what I was doing and just stared at me befuddled. My brain was going haywire with this information, assessing if the situation would bring danger. Soon the emotions of confusion and frustration overwhelmed me; I started crying, running to my parents and asking why the figure wouldn\\'t leave me alone. My parents soothingly informed me of what a shadow was and why I should not be afraid of it. Flash forward twelve years later and this story is inevitably still mentioned to me at least once every year during family gatherings. It serves as a memory of unique childlike curiosity and hilarity to my family. Why did this particular moment stick with me out of all the memories I had of my childhood? In retrospect, nothing special truly happened that should have made the memory follow me. However, that was the first time I had truly questioned and investigated something of interest to me. I took the lead of an investigation and proved that I could take the steps to find a solution, even if my parents had to give away the answer. It was a lesson that I would recognize in later years. There is no one even that transforms a person into an adult; adulthood is a collection of lessons and experiences that evolve a person. This one moment of my life marked my first shallow steps into adulthood.My family has always labeled me as headstrong. There is little doubt that this is a result of being surrounded by the women in my family who are each powerful in their own right. My aunt showed me what being independent meant. My sisters aided me in developing unending patience through moments of frustration. Finally, my mom was the one who taught me how to love through the difficult times. Gone are the days when I was afraid to talk to strangers, choosing instead to hide behind my mom\\'s legs. I have learned to take the initiative in situations and become powerful in my own right. With the events surrounding this year I now hold true to my beliefs. Racism, intolerance, women\\'s rights, and hate crimes are the problems that so many people are facing on a day-to-day basis. It is because of this that I am no longer afraid to speak my mind solely because issues are labeled as \\'controversial\\' or because they may make people uncomfortable. My strength is not solely reliant on my academic standing. I have become aware of the problems that surround us all today and am ready to use my voice in a positive matter to raise awareness, inform, and make a change.Growing up as an only child for six years, I was often the focus of my parents\\' attention. I learned to hone the skill of negotiating for this very reason. I was the experimental child so to speak, meaning that my parents were, and still are, the sternest with me. I learned from a young age, around the time I was starting school, to negotiate with them to attain something I desired. Then, my parents were the ones negotiating, often bribing me with toys or dollar bills for straight A\\'s or perfect grades on spelling tests. The positive reinforcement continued until I arrived at middle school; this was when I recognized I could often negotiate my own terms in order to be allowed out with my friends. The best result was that I grew up wanting outstanding grades, which meant receiving what I asked for came easily. As I continued to mature, the foundation stayed the same but the outcomes changed. My greatest negotiation occurred while I was in eighth grade preparing to enter high school. I resolved to finish high school with excellent grades, graduate in the top twenty percent of my class, and attend a university. In return, my aunt promised me a trip to Europe following my graduation. Now, four years later, my aunt is preparing to buy a travel package to three different countries for the last week of May. Negotiations are a part of everyday life, whether we realize it or not; being able to make my own negotiations has led to extraordinary outcomes.Educational opportunities present themselves in different forms. When combined, they allow me to enhance what was originally presented. My school, Xavier College Preparatory, aims to prepare students for universities by providing individuals with the tools necessary for success. The electives Xavier offers allow me to explore interests outside of my collegiate focus. Over the years I have taken classes such as: Criminal Law, Sociology, Astronomy, and AP Psychology. These classes have provided me with exploring different options, and, as a result, introduced me to the idea of double majoring with Psychology due to my enjoyment and passion for the class. Electives introduced me to different types of classes such as Sociology, which requires discussion based thought processes. Besides the electives offered, Xavier encouraged me in furthering my science and mathematical abilities. I entered high school taking Geometry the summer before ninth grade, and will end my high school career with Multivariate Calculus. Additionally, summer school classes helped me to advance in science where I completed the three core science prerequisites, which permitted me to enroll in Anatomy/Physiology. The opportunities Xavier offered accumulated, enhancing not only my academic progress, but helping me explore my own interests outside of STEM classes, thereby reinforcing my interest in math, science, and social sciences.Humans are some of the most fascinating creatures to ever roam Earth: Thoughts, emotions, and passions drive our actions. To study the human mind and its functions is to study the person. For this reason, AP Psychology has rapidly become the subject towards which I am most inclined. Initially, I took psychology because of my interest in neuroscience. This class was the closest opportunity to an in depth study of the nervous system, even if the course focused on the mind. The unit on neural processing first piqued my interest in psychology as a possible major alongside neuroscience. After studying units on cognition, memory, sensation and perception, and biology I realized the deep passion I had for studying the mind.My original intention was to attend college majoring in a physical science, like biology, if neuroscience were not offered. However, because I took this class I am now considering majoring in Neuroscience and Psychology, if possible. I have always had an interest in the brain; my curiosity stemmed from watching shows like House that would offer in depth explanations of rare cases. These explanations with the accompanying images of the disease and its effect on the body drew me to medicine. The brain, the true powerhouse of the body, lured me to neuroscience. Through this journey I developed a fascination for the functions of the nervous system and the mind. How the nervous system and mind work together and the effects they cause are what I am interested in studying throughout my college career; to think, it all started when I signed up to take AP Psychology.\"}, {\"index\": 150, \"new_personal_statement\": \"A Reflection on Research Conducted on History IA QuestionThroughout the course of working on my IA, I have acquired a multitude of knowledge I lacked previously. My question, to what extent did the Black Plague influence animosity towards the Catholic Church, limited me to a few authors from the time period. While attempting to find primary sources, I realized one of the obstacles historians face. I imagine that the further back in time the topic is, the harder it is to find primary sources. As opposed to classmates who researched more recent topics, I could not interview or find many interview of people from the time period. In addition, the time period I chose to research was the beginning of when writing about historical incidents became prevalent. Finding a primary source was difficult because many people were preoccupied with the plague and worried about their health. The primary source I found was a Renaissance humanist writer; therefore, he is free to interpret the event as he sees fit. This comes to question the validity of primary sources if one is fortunate enough to locate it. Finding a primary source that has adequate reliability is a challenge since many individuals in the time period were uneducated and would be unable to efficiently describe the happenings of the time. Not only may the primary sources have limited education, they may have a biased perspective, forcing the historian to interpret the usefulness of the source. This was especially key to my research, since many of the people who would have been writing about the happenings of the time, would have resented the Church.Another difficulty I encountered when researching was the credibility of websites with information on the Black Plague. Many websites offered a basic overview of the events that occurred, not an in-depth analysis. They gave facts to help one understand the general happenings of the Black Plague, but did not delve further into what happened. Information that was \\'deeper than the surface\\' was difficult to locate due to the lack of records at the time. Many governments stopped keeping records shortly before the plague; therefore, limiting the sources historians could access. This is coincidental because the plague was predicted by the people in the time period. This makes me understand how hard it is for historians to uncover records from history. The time period that I chose to research was a large factor in the difficulty to find information since humans in general were less intelligent, organized, and not concerned with the future. This IA made me realize some of the obstacles historians face, especially when researching history with little detailed information.\"}, {\"index\": 151, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The crowd erupted as Charles Ar\\\\u00e0nguiz headed home Chile\\'s first goal. Even the torrential rain could not drown out the excitement. Looking side to side, I pumped my fist, letting out a suppressed \\'Vamos!\\' in the cheer-free press box. Four minutes later, when Jos\\\\u00e9 Pedro Fuenzalida popped in Chile\\'s second goal, the scene repeated, the roar of the Chilean barras (fan sections) bellowing even louder. Surveying the whole situation from above, I could only smile. It was the pinnacle moment of my sportswriting career thus far, and certainly a crowning episode of my lifelong passion for sports.I have always had a unique enthusiasm for sports. Rather than simply cheering on my favorite team, I would scan daily box scores as a kid and absorb every bit of analysis. Due to this interest, I read Michael Lewis\\'s Moneyball, which describes how the Oakland Athletics used statistics to optimize their success on a small budget. That application of mathematics into sports really resonated with me because I see sports as a numbers game, a chess match, where a club of players, coaches, and executives must come together to find on-field triumph. Seeing sports through that lens set my journalist career in motion. I joined a small NBA blog in eighth grade and now, less than three years later, I was in Chicago covering the Copa Am\\\\u00e9rica Centenario semifinal between Chile\\\\u2013my Chile\\\\u2013and Colombia.This game was a prime example of why I love sports, and particularly f\\\\u00fatbol, so much: the action provides a universal language for people of all backgrounds to connect. In Latin America, f\\\\u00fatbol has united countries torn apart by prejudice and become a second religion for many, including myself. Growing up with my father\\'s Chilean influence, I have always wanted to connect to my Latino roots, and I have done that through The Beautiful Game. Being surrounded by tens of thousands of likeminded La Roja (Chilean national f\\\\u00fatbol team) supporters from around the world meant so much more to me than the match itself, because it gave me a tangible tie to my heritage.My father and grandfather were born in Chile and my great-grandfather, Israel Drapkin, from whom I got my middle name, grew up there after moving from Argentina. Israel was a doctor on the Easter Island expedition which discovered that the moai (monolithic human statues found on the island) were made by ancestors of the Rapa Nui and he supplied leprosy care for the island\\'s indigenous people. Learning about my past and the distinct experiences that make up Chile\\'s rich culture, however, was different than getting to enjoy them in person. My grandparents would make empanadas de pino (savory, meat-stuffed pastries) and pastel de choclo (beef and corn shepherd\\'s pie) on occasion when I visited, but it was not until I started covering La Roja that I began to really embrace my ancestry in a meaningful way. The Copa Am\\\\u00e9rica allowed me to really see the culture firsthand, with the smell of fresh-cooked pregame asados (barbecues) and the sounds of national pride filling the atmosphere throughout the spectacle. The intensity of that pride only rose once the game got underway, and after finishing the press conferences and publishing my game story, I felt a certain sense of completeness.When my Uber dropped me off at the airport at 3 a.m., 12 hours after my arrival in Chicago, I was exhausted, but still riding the wave of euphoria from Chile\\'s 2-0 win. F\\\\u00fatbol, like English and Spanish, is a language that can bridge gaps and enrich lives across the globe, and I had seen my two cultures blended together through sports right on the field in front of me. Through writing, I try to bring South American f\\\\u00fatbol to North America, with the hope of capturing my experiences and enabling others to find the same passion within themselves.\"}, {\"index\": 152, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Since the time I could understand it, I\\'ve had an interest in childbirth. This inherent interest led me to discover the practice of midwifery, a type of maternity care that stresses natural births led by midwives, and I soon became passionate learning more about its differences with traditional hospital maternity care, which is led by obstetricians, physicians trained in childbirth. Through articles, documentaries and books I came to understand the advantages and positive outcomes of midwife-led births, and conversely, how hospital births could negatively impact women by providing too many medical interventions. At the same time, not only did I want to pursue something I was passionate about, but also challenge myself to do better than my parents. My parents believe I can do better than them and with all respect, I believe I can. Not because I believe I am more gifted or that they were not as determined, but because they started from the ground up and laid the foundation, giving me the opportunities that they did not have. I knew studying medicine and becoming a physician - a career I could be passionate about - was a way I could accomplish my hopes of building upon my parent\\'sachievements. Midwifery, while a respectable career, wasn\\'t exactly what either I or my parents had envisioned. With time ticking, and knowing I didn\\'t want to enter college undecided, I thought I had two choices: midwifery or medicine. Both allowed me to engage with a passion of mine, but I couldn\\'t be an obstetrician and a midwife. That\\'s not how it worked.Then, one day it came to me all of sudden: Why do I have to submit to established options? Why do I have to choose one or the other? Why can\\'t I be a changemaker in maternity care in America?By challenging the belief that I had to make a choice based on established options, I became someone inspired to make change. No longer was I bound to the predetermined path. By simply deciding mentally not to conform to established options - midwife or obstetrician - I opened a door of initiative, creativity and vision. Now I hope that one day, as someone trained both as a physician and midwife, I can bridge the gap between hospital and midwifery maternity care. I want women to have the safety of a hospital birth and the independence of a midwifery birth. If we hope for our nation\\'s maternity system to improve and for maternity death rates to decrease, we need both. There\\'s no joint program to become both a midwife and a physician, but that doesn\\'t mean I can\\'t do it - it simply means I have to take the initiative to complete both trainings separately. As for changing America\\'s maternity care to provide safer births for women, there\\'s no easy twelve step solution -creativity and vision are vital to drawing out and accomplishing goals. What\\'s established does not dictate what can be done, and I hope that by shattering the idea that I have to choose medicine over midwifery or vice versa, I can not only prosper as an individual, but make an impactful change.Now that I fully grasp the magnitude of this concept, I can never envision my career, let alone my life, as a series of predetermined paths. I reject that. Progress can\\'t be made from the vision that how things are is how they\\'ll always be; rather, it is through envisioning a better future you can help create, that progress is made. I never thought I was someone with a mission to change, but by challenging the belief that I had to choose one path, I became someone with the vision and mentality to do so.Through the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, students are required to write an extended essay of up to 4000 words on a topic that interests them. As an IB student, I chose to write a historical argument essay examining the role of religion in the development of Vegetarianism in mid-1800s America. The required extended research and writing gave me the opportunity to dig deep into subject matter, develop my research and argumentative writing skills, and enjoy the rich learning process. In gathering sources to support my argument, I had to be creative. Finding sources can be incredibly frustrating and time consuming; I couldn\\'t simply use a search engine online - I had to search through online archives, and find books on my topic and other sources citing primary evidence. Relying on my creative energies was imperative to uncovering relevant sources. When I\\'d find them, the joy of discovering the next puzzle piece propelled me to continue investigating. While exhausting, analyzing these unique sources in the process of crafting my argument was paradoxically exhilarating. The task of dissecting sources to extrapolate meaning and visualizing sources converging to support one of my claims was exciting; a common thread of reason was weaving its way through all of my sources, and I was anxious to begin writing down my thoughts. Grasping the central argument for my essay for the first time after the diligence and determination I had put into finding and analyzing sources was a invigorating moment.Pulling everything together into a 4000 word essay was one of the most gratifying academic moments of my life. It was enriching. Arranging the argument to my liking was enriching. Adding my personal thoughts on an excerpt was enriching. Raising questions about the implications of my argument was enriching. The IB program gave me an opportunity I wouldn\\'t have received in a traditional academic program; although anyone can resolve to write an essay on their own, IB requiring the extended essay pushed me to hone skills that otherwise would have remained stagnant. Furthermore, the extended essay process instilled in me a passion for inquisition and argumentative writing.During my freshman and sophomore year, I played for my high school\\'s soccer team; but, overwhelmed with the time commitment the team demanded and the workload of academics, I decided not to try out my junior year. The lack of sleep and constant practices and games left me worn out. By the end of the season my sophomore year, I knew I couldn\\'t do it anymore. Nevertheless, breaking my commitment to the team bothered me for months. Although I never regretted my decision, at times I felt ashamed for giving up.However, in the year I took off from soccer, I learned to how to better manage my time with a heavy workload, accomplish tasks effectively, and most importantly, how to handle stress and break down anxious thoughts. Over the course of the year, I saw myself change from the anxiety-ridden freshman and sophomore to the stronger, cognizant junior who was capable of handling challenges. That year I was the most reflective and introspective, and as a result, I came to understand how my thoughts could be a stumbling block to my success and happiness in whatever I pursued, whether on the field or in the classroom. In late spring of my junior year, I realized I was ready to come back. I was in a good place. The personal growth I had experienced my junior year had prepared me to handle the challenges of high school soccer and I felt confident I could enjoy the game this time. The importance of this story is that my departure from the team after my sophomore year was not taken easily or without thought. Commitment is something I value deeply and want to exemplify in all my actions. Still, the personal growth I experienced my junior year in taking the time to develop my resiliency shaped me into the individual I am today. Taking time away from the sport, while difficult, gave me the space to become the person I want to be on the field, in the classroom and in my personal life.I wouldn\\'t say English if asked what my favorite subject was. I would likely say math; after all, it\\'s the subject at which I most excel. But with some thought (and honesty), English, actually, is my favorite subject. For all the fascination I get from math and its concreteness, the nuances and flavor of English excite me more. It is through English that I have been able to express my thoughts, articulate the precision of my view, shape words to my voice and explore the world. For example, in my junior year, we spent a semester focusing on the use of rhetoric in advertising and marketing. The topic was stimulating and gave me an opportunity to apply the fundamentals of rhetoric to the world by looking at advertising in contexts like commerce. At the end of the semester, I wrote and sent a letter to Unilever Inc., discussing the empowerment marketing techniques they use in advertising for Dove. English provides the opportunity to combine my writing skills and knowledge on current topics to engage with the world.On a personal level, English has helped me unravel memories and feelings that otherwise would\\'ve been left tangled. My English classes have always given me freedom to choose what I want to write about, which, while daunting at first, has given me the opportunity to write about topics that hit home. In my freshman year, I wrote an essay describing the feelings of isolation I experienced from my culture because I couldn\\'t speak Spanish fluently. In my junior year, I wrote a memoir about my grandmother\\'s death. In both pieces, I picked apart and expressed the situation in ways I couldn\\'t do in my head. Now on paper, these feelings are not forgotten or blurred - they are fresh and preserved by the written word. The emotion I put into my memoir gave me the confidence to submit it to the Scholastic Arts and Writing Awards - and I received a Silver Key Award! English, while certainly not my easiest subject, has been the most rewarding subject both in my academic and personal life.In the daily bustle of school and responsibilities it\\'s easy to forget the greater meaning of an education. After all, the main focus emphasized throughout our school careers, and especially in high school, is grades and tests; the amount of time and energy devoted to exploration greatly dwindles after elementary school. And I miss it. I miss the fieldtrips we used to take to the art museum or the caverns or the county fair. I miss getting out of the classroom and experiencing things firsthand. I miss school kindling my fire to learn by interacting with the world around me.This urge to engage with my surroundings is exactly what sets me apart. My eagerness to learn for the sake of learning and understanding the world around me continues on. At the end of the day, learning is much more for me than the grades and scores - I want to learn about economics and zoology and business. I want to visit the art museums and the zoos and the company headquarters. Time and time again, I have found myself centering back on my insatiable desire to learn no matter how burnt out I have felt. The world continues to fascinate me and draw me in. Learning is so much more than what you learn in the classroom. I lose track of time researching random things on the internet like \\'What is necrotizing fasciitis?\\' or \\'What was the French Revolution?\\' or \\'Define lackadaisical\\'. I love when listening to someone else\\'s perspective changes my entire perspective on them, such as when we read our essays with partners in class or discuss a current event. National Public Radio\\'s Ted Radio Hour has become the background music to my life and continues to feed me compelling ideas that keep me open-minded and engaged. What all this means is that learning for me happens just as much outside the classroom as inside - and that exploration plays a central role in my learning. My eagerness to learn always comes back to me and is my source of motivation to keep pushing on.\"}, {\"index\": 153, \"new_personal_statement\": \"For all her conforming to American culture, my mother never lost her aptitude for creating delicious and original food.The kitchen is her fortress. She dislikes it when people hover around her kitchen space while she works her magic. If I ever announce \\'I\\'m going to make pasta\\' and pull out a box of spaghetti, it doesn\\'t matter if she\\'s on the opposite end of the apartment, she will rise, set water to boil, add salt and pour the pasta. In short, I\\'d had little opportunity to test my cooking abilities, until one fateful summer day. Did I know brownies could burn so badly as to leave soot on the whole interior of an oven? No, but I learned.I was too embarrassed to ask my mother, my cooking queen, for help or advice. I was scared of disappointing her and decided I could figure it out myself. So I kept cooking in secret, sifting through her dog-eared cookbooks, following instructions meticulously, until one day I managed to produce carbonara sauce - which I had to throw away, because the spaghetti I was supposed to eat with it had caught on fire - and anyways, the sauce was most definitely over-salted.I wasn\\'t used to such a streak of failures. My tendency has always been to grow curious of a skill and hone it until I become somewhat proficient. That\\'s what happened when I taught myself sudoku strategies and went on to win a newspaper prize for solving a puzzle. Or when I tried fashioning my hair into a French braid, had to cut out a fist of hopelessly knotted hair, and five months later aced my braiding technique. I even tried my hand at gardening: after killing off one or two cacti, I wound up with a beautiful, healthy little mint plant. In other words, I had a history of pursuing skill-learning to fruition, so it was frustrating that cooking resisted me so.One day, I was leafing through one of my mother\\'s cookbooks when I noticed one of the recipes had pencil marks on it. I soon realized these were notes, my mother\\'s, providing insight on the instructions: \\'150 grams of sugar, not 220,\\' \\'175\\\\u00b0C = 350\\\\u00b0F,\\' \\'Lower to 300\\\\u00b0F after 15 minutes in oven,\\' etc. I gathered the ingredients and closely followed the recipe, heeding my mother\\'s advice.Two hours later, I set a steaming pound cake on the table. \\'It smells great!\\' my mother remarked when she walked into the apartment. I was delighted, but feared disappointment. At dinner, I cut her a slice.\\'This is a quatre-quarts, isn\\'t it?\\' my mother observed. Her fork came to roost next to an empty plate. I nodded, beaming.\\'My grandmother used to make it for me. She also made crepes.\\' My mother paused and furrowed her brow. \\'Do you know how to make crepes?\\'\\'Non,\\' I replied.\\'I can teach you, if you\\'d like.\\'And so my mother taught me how to make crepes. Instead of listing off ingredient ratios, she taught me to recognize the right consistency, taste and aspect of the dough. That day, I acquired instincts, but not necessarily knowledge. Later I realized how futile it\\'d been to try self-teaching these sorts of things: this skill was human, unbelievably so.Later that day, as we feasted on golden crepes, I started brainstorming new projects. Learning how to play David Bowie on the recorder, perhaps? Or nailing a split? How about teaching myself how to knit a sweater? Finally, something dawned on me: there were invaluable lessons to learn right before my eyes.\\'Can you teach me how to make scones?\\' I asked my mother.\\'Of course.\\'There will be time for David Bowie partitions, gymnastic attempts, knitted presents and more, as far as my curiosity will take me. But for now, I welcome my mother\\'s expertise, knowing we\\'ll always learn together, no matter the time or the dish.\"}, {\"index\": 154, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I was ten-years-old and stuck in a room with no space. I rushed to the hall closet, got the drawing pad, and went to work. My mind flooded with ideas, a phenomenon that I called \\'designer\\'s high,\\' which would, overtime, become ordinary in my everyday life. I settled on a somewhat unorthodox, yet space efficient design: I would build a platform that hangs five feet above the floor (my approximate height at the time) and would suspend my bed, leaving abundant floor space. Two weeks later, after multiple struggles to find studs in the wall, keep my parents on board, and dodge the cold hands of death (it was my first time using power tools), my design, a once intangible idea, finally materialized. It was at this moment that I found a direction. What started as a physical space problem in my room became a metaphor for the numerous areas in my life where I could create space and make room for change. I needed to create space in order to initiate change. But where to start? Naples High School, and others surrounding it, is teeming with high-functioning, over-driven, and hyper-competitive students that compromise their happiness now for the success that they believe they will receive in the future. I believe that this is flawed. People must be positive in the present in order to experience a \\'happiness advantage.\\' Most believe that if they work hard, then they will be more successful, and if they are more successful, then they will be happier. However, this creates a never-ending cycle, continuously changing the goal-post of success and pushing happiness off the visible spectrum. If you get a good grade, then you need a better grade. If you made $10, now you need to make $15. In that, the degree of success determines one\\'s innate happiness level. It seems as though people function better, more productively, more creatively, and more intelligently when they are happy. I believe that the success-driven formula for happiness is scientifically backwards. The lens through which our brains view the world shapes our reality, and this lens has been altered in a way that introduces stress and anxiety into our lives, a lot like the clutter in my room, decreasing our happiness quotients. Much like the space that was needed in my room, space was now needed elsewhere: to make room for happiness at my school. It seems as though, regardless of the goals they intend to accomplish, students are conditioned to be happy after they get what they want, so I aimed to create a program that would put students at the helm of the ship: The Leadership Club. As president and creator of the newly founded club, I was able to secure a seat on the Student Advisory Council (SAC); seats were typically only held by parents and administrators. This position was extremely instrumental, considering all decisions for the school had to be passed through the SAC. Having this seat allowed students to bear a voice in what happens at the school and within the community. With hopes to brighten the spirits of my classmates, the club put on multiple outdoor concerts during lunch (because I believe music is a foundation of happiness), worked with Hope for Haiti (because doing good feels good), and has even set up events to take place at the school for years to come, successfully digressing students\\' minds from their chock-full schedules and cluttered lives to finally make space for happiness. While the problem that I solved is small in the whole scheme of world problems, its significance to me is unyielding. To create and promote happiness for those around me sparked a piece of my mind. Everyone is born with \\'a little spark of madness. You mustn\\'t lose it.\\' \\\\u2013 Robin Williams. \"}, {\"index\": 155, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Come on, Tito. You have to improvise.\\' The words run through my mind as I race towards the obstacle. \\'Okay,tense your core and pull a Double Kong vault. Wait! Not too hard!\\' My feet land on the ground on the oppositeside of the barrier, which happens to be my aunt\\'s car. I breathe out.Parkour is the act of getting from point A to B as efficiently as possible, using your body as vehicle. I love it. Itrequires excellent mind-body coordination, rapid reflexes, great situational awareness and fast-paced analysis. Forme parkour is effectively the enactment of engineering in motion. This is true of other sports too, of course. Whenrunning through an opponent\\'s defence in Rugby, complex equations of motion and momentum fly into my head,and I visualise with clarity how I must shift my centre of gravity to remain running at a certain velocity and anglewhilst gliding precariously along the field touchline without being touched, in order to score. In parkour walls, rails,and other structures are the terrain on which to play out a set of similar mathematical analyses. I\\'ve taken walls ofover 8 feet without a scratch, but I\\'ve also failed at the same walls, with scars as proof of my efforts.Parkour is beautiful though, exactly because it is not merely mechanical. Instead it reveals what the human body iscapable of doing. With constant running, climbing, vaulting, and rolling, I stretch my physical boundaries to seewhat I am capable of, and every new flip reveals a physical beauty in motion. In parkour my success ultimatelydepends on matching physical strength with flair and creativity.Parkour, in its beauty and grace as much as its call on my resilience and commitment, has bent and shaped andflipped other parts of my life too and given me the vision to move beyond boundaries. This has been particularlytrue as I found new ways to explore science and engineering. When I felt stymied by bureaucratic limitations inschool, I stepped around them and found my own walls to scale. I wanted to study more maths and electronics,and to do so looked beyond school and taught myself the courses. I absorbed college-level stress analysiswebinars, engaged intensely with an online material science course, and passionately discussed vehicle dynamicsat an international conference last year. Sometimes the barrier is the notion that learning only happens in aclassroom, and then I recover the joy of discovery by playing around with household chemicals to test fuels insome Coke cans, or teaching my brother why the OH-group in my mum\\'s nail-polish remover (acetone) burnsbetter than his deodorant. Experimenting with my brother also reminds me that the only thing more exciting thanexploration is doing it with others, and I try to replicate that pleasure of scientific collaboration through mentorshipand the dissemination of science to younger students in the STEM club I founded. One day I switched on a motorthat I helped them build - watching their beady eyes light up on their oil-smudged cheeks induced in me a positivefeeling like no other.In parkour one\\'s best efforts sometimes come short, as they do in life. In Year 12 all the frenetic energy of myextracurricular life and the stress of an intense course load burnt me out. I was exhausted, and my gradesdropped. But the point of parkour is not to avoid challenges but to confront them successfully - to flip over them ifyou can or to creatively negotiate your way around them. So with resilience and stamina I succeeded in Year 13 - Itake on the challenge of life, and with creativity and flexibility, I navigate it.\"}, {\"index\": 156, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Eating at HoHo\\'s (a \\'Chinese\\' restaurant in Blairstown, NJ) was one of my favorite parts of being away at boarding school. I had grown to love American Chinese food. Whether consuming fried rice from an oyster pail, scientifically measuring the perfect ratio of soy sauce to duck sauce (which was certainly not served in Asia), or opening a pseudo-philosophical fortune cookie, I savored the experience. Before coming to the US, my parents had warned me about American Chinese food\\'s inauthenticity. Indeed, I had never seen this type of food served in Hong Kong or anywhere else in Asia. But I loved it nonetheless.Still, there was one thing I used to dread. Ordering takeout with my friends, they would inevitably ask: \\'Do you think this is authentic?\\' I would then emphatically answer, no. This would end the conversation since, having lived in Hong Kong for most of my life, my American friends seemed to think I had authority in the matter.This June, having returned from the U.S. for the summer, I was hungry for \\'real\\' Chinese cuisine. So I headed to a Cantonese restaurant downtown. As I sat at the round, linen-covered table, I felt like an eager child waiting to open Christmas presents. But when the menu came, my eyes widened in shock. General Tso\\'s Chicken? This dish was one of my favorites at HoHo\\'s, but it was classic American Chinese\\\\u2013\\\\u2013it didn\\'t belong in Asia. I felt appalled. Nevertheless, I decided to order it. I needed to investigate the difference in taste between the HoHo\\'s version and the Hong Kong version.The food came 15 minutes later. I could smell its mouth-watering aroma even before I saw the waiter approaching.He set the plate on the table. My eyes drank in the sight of that glazed, golden-brown chicken, faintly steaming. I crunched down on a morsel, relishing its taste: a perfect balance of sweet, salty, and spicy, coated in a crunchy, fried exterior. It was exactly like the General Tso\\'s Chicken at HoHo\\'s\\\\u2014absolutely delicious. I was flabbergasted.Enjoying inauthentic food in an authentic restaurant felt wrong.Then I experienced an epiphany. What was wrong wasn\\'t an authentic Chinese restaurant serving General Tso\\'s Chicken, or even that I was enjoying it. What was wrong was me using the idea of authenticity as a measuring stick. Typically, food characterized as authentic is automatically embraced as good and food characterized as inauthentic is dismissed as bad. But in reality, authenticity is independent from taste. Inauthentic food can be good as well. Or maybe there\\'s a middle ground, an authentic inauthenticity. After all, American Chinese food was specifically developed as a sort of fusion, and it works. It\\'s delectable. This being true, I concluded that the simple, easy, authentic/inauthentic distinction is meaningless.Just this summer, my friend Paul flew from Thailand to see me in Hong Kong. Before he headed home, we went souvenir shopping. He wanted something symbolic of his time visiting me. So, I took him to Mongkok, a relatively un-gentrified area where locals shop. In a small store, Paul picked up a grey tunic, colloquially known as the Mao Suit. These jackets became popular in China because leaders used to wear them in public meetings. The suit\\'s reference to China\\'s political history would make it a great souvenir. I didn\\'t think Thailand had anything like that.Paul was ecstatic, and decided to try on his purchase. Yet, just as he was about to put it on, he paused and made a face. Confused, I looked closer. He held up the tag. It read: \\'Made In Thailand.\\' Speechless, we looked at each other with awkward smiles. \\'I like it,\\' he assured me.

As the doors slid open, a gust of wind blew at my face as I fought against the crowd of people rushing into the subway cars. I made my way towards the station\\'s exit, which glowed from the sunlight.When I stepped out, I was facing a bridge that led out to an island with a large, crowded square, the Heiwa Koen. In front of me was a glass building lined with drawings of doves on the walls and strings of paper cranes hanging from the ceiling. In the distance, there was an old, broken down building standing alone in the open field. I immediately recognized it to be the A-Bomb Dome.Suddenly, the sounds of sirens filled through the air and a woman\\'s voice rang through the speakers.In Japanese, she spoke. \\'It is currently 11:02 a.m. For the next couple of minutes, please take a moment of silence to commemorate the dropping of the second atomic bomb.\\'Then it hit me. Today was August 9th. The day that the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Just 3 days before in 1945, in this very place, the first bomb was dropped. Everything around me just stopped. Tourists put down their cameras, and all conversations ended abruptly. We stood in total silence.My thoughts, though, were not silent. I agonized - should I feel the pain and sadness of the Japanese people? Or should I feel guilty for being American, from the country that dropped the bomb? I frantically looked around, trying to find answers.But then I closed my eyes and breathed in deeply, settling my nerves. Slowly, I thought about the people who lived through this terrible day in the very place I was standing. Thousands of Japanese lives were taken in a matter of seconds, while the Americans had the reason of trying to end the war that would continue to take many more lives if it was prolonged. Both countries had been suffering in their own ways. Today was not a day just to commemorate the Japanese, but to remember the effect the bombs had on the whole world.Almost instantly, the answer to the question I was always looking for seemed so insignificant. All this time, I had been trying to categorize myself into a certain nationality, but why couldn\\'t I just be both? They both had a significant in shaping who I was and allowed me to be unique from everyone else.And from that moment, I realized that I found my identity. I didn\\'t need to be defined by any labels or stereotypes. I could be whoever I wanted to be, whether that be Japanese and American and any other name. Whatever may come my way from now on, I won\\'t falter trying to fit myself into a group, because nothing in life has to be black and white - it is a palette of colors.\"}, {\"index\": 158, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Last Halloween was the scariest day of my life, without ghosts, goblins, or witches. No, I didn\\'t go to an abandoned house or play with a ouija board. The villain of this story was no monster, it was a Mustang. It was a beautiful fall day. I went out with my parents for a morning drive. My brain started hurting, my vision was getting fuzzy, and to stop the headache from getting any worse, I needed to take three advil. My parents know the drill with my migraines, so my mom always has a bottle of ibuprofen with her, just incase. Unfortunately, that October day, my mom pulled the bottle out of her purse, empty.Sometimes the smallest moments really do change your life. We pulled into a Rite Aid, on the edge of town. The only unusual thing I realize now was how loudly the car parked behind us was playing their music. It was a greenish-grey Mustang convertible. I can honestly say I have never looked at a Mustang the same way since. My dad was in and out of the pharmacy in a couple of minutes. I took three advil with water, glad that my brain would soon stop feeling like it was being squeezed out of my head. The car, the Mustang, was still in the same parking spot, and it was still playing its music loudly. \\'A woman inside was scowling at me,\\' My dad said, putting our little red Jeep in reverse, \\'I think she got into that convertible.\\'As soon as my dad had driven out of our space, the Mustang whipped out of its own, then started tailgating us. Out of the parking lot, we went straight towards the neighboring 7/11, while the woman revved her engine and turned left. Next to the convenience store, we thought we were invisible from the intersection she\\'d turned into. My dad inched along, peaking out. I was getting a sick feeling in my stomach.\\'No Dad, move back, she\\'ll see us.\\' My voice was cracking a little, and I think that\\'s why he listened. I think that\\'s why this story is only scary and not tragic.As he reversed, we heard the engine of the sports car roar one more time. From around corner, the Mustang came flying at us. Full speed. Frantic. My mom screamed. If we had only been a few inches closer to the entrance, she would have hit us. She would have hurt us. I know it. The Mustang had swerved only a little, then slowed down as it was parallel to our Jeep. She stared us down, one hand on the wheel like some character in The Fast and the Furious. Then, back around the building she went. I was yelling. My mom was hysterical.My dad called 911, \\'Hi, my name is Detective Cronin, my family and I are on our way to the station, a green Mustang just tried to\\\\u2026\\'We flew from the 7/11 to the police department. I looked behind us the whole way.Her name was Michele, the one inside the Mustang. My dad had investigated her and her ex-boyfriend, who\\'s in jail for murder. She was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. The 7/11 camera had caught it all. We had a police detail at our house. The story was in all the local newspapers. We\\'d gotten threats before, but they\\'d happened when I was young and didn\\'t understand.I have nightmares. I drive to the police station when I think someone is following me, which happens a lot. I cringe at the sight of any mustang, especially those painted green. I even feel queasy writing about this, a year later. It\\'s no paranormal activity, but what happened to my family and me last October was terrifying, maybe more scary than a movie because it\\'s real, because I live with it everyday.\"}, {\"index\": 159, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I stood there in that dreaded hallway, nervously awaiting my coming fate. Although I had been in this situation before, everything was just a little extra worrisome that day. My throat was a little extra parched. My water, a little extra empty. My traditional Indian outfit, a little extra itchy. In an effort to calm myself down, I hummed through the composition I had painstakingly memorized the last two months. As I trudged my way through the composition, the door next to me finally opened. Praying one last time, I walked in the room to take my fourth year Indian classical singing exam. I barely passed. My guru and I shared a sigh of relief, and soon enough, the routine was back on track. With our eyes set for my fifth year exam, I resumed my weekly lessons and practices. However, there was something about being in high school for the first time and finding a new life that made me lose motivation to continue the same routine. I didn\\'t feel like singing for another year with only an exam in mind. I felt stagnant, like I was stuck in a cycle of singing that resulted in one thing: a mere grade. I was seriously losing interest. I even considered stopping altogether. I sat in my room alone and leafed through four years\\' worth of singing certificates and pictures, thinking about what it would be like to take singing out of my life. And that\\'s where I faltered. Singing Indian classical music became a part of who I was, my personality. I couldn\\'t give that up. So, I thought about how I was going to rekindle my love for singing. Singing allowed me to connect to people in a way that surpassed conversations and actions. I used to love singing for people, but with exams taking priority, I searched less for eager ears and more for the tone of my Re komal swar. Passing exams would stay in my vision, but I wanted to embrace the other side of singing, the side that involved connecting with an audience, exploring my culture, and fostering my personality with my voice. It was exciting. There was a whole world of singing that I never even cared to look at. I explored singing in different styles, genres, and even languages. I broke from the routine, singing for my friends at school and family back home. I was building connections, with myself, my voice, and the people who were important to me. But the day I sang for a cause proved to me just how powerful this other side of singing can really be. It was a Sunday afternoon and I was at another lesson with my guru. After a long hour learning about the taans of Rag Behag, she told me about a charity singing group that was hosting a concert in less than a month. Inspired by a new energy, I auditioned right away and joined the Green Chillies Entertainment group. With rehearsals beginning immediately, I was thrown into an environment of singers who sang with a passion that caught my eye. I watched as they poured their hearts and souls into their voices from that day until night of the concert. Head bobbing, eyes closed, and body swaying, I, too, poured every emotion into my voice. We, the singers, connected with the emotions of the audience, raising over a thousand dollars for CRY, an organization that supports child\\'s rights. Maybe it was the simple smile on my mother\\'s face or the look of approval on my brother\\'s. Maybe it was the roar of the crowd or the feeling of happiness in supporting a pressing issue. Whatever it was, I felt it, as I sat there taking my fifth year singing exam. I walked in and out with confidence, knowing I passed both the exam and the challenge of reinventing myself as a singer.\"}, {\"index\": 160, \"new_personal_statement\": \"When I was in the tenth grade, my family and I began going to multi-family group therapy for my sister, who had been struggling with substance abuse. I went to support her recovery even though sharing my emotions was unfamiliar and uncomfortable for me. In each session, a different family would sit in the middle and talk through the issues that brought them to the group. Rather than pay attention, I would often check out. I\\'d bring pens and paper to draw, or I\\'d think about my homework.I felt far more comfortable at school, where I was able to project my strengths in a way that made me feel confident and respectable. I was writing newspaper articles on gender, organizing marches, and leading feminist workshops. I was determined to mobilize students to make social change, and I was fortunate to have such a great platform as an outspoken feminist on campus. I felt empowered by that respectability, but in family group, I struggled to feel in control.One night, it was my sister and my mom\\'s turn to go in the middle. They were both strong, ambitious women who rarely showed emotion, so I had very low expectations. I had seen them try to work out their problems before, but like me, they tended to avoid being honest about their emotions. But, to my surprise, my mom and sister really opened up to each other. They held hands the entire time and frequently paused to wipe tears from their eyes. Their honesty stirred something inside of me, and I cried for the first time in a while. At the end of the night, after the facilitator closed the session, the two of them stood up and shared a long hug, and after a short while, I joined them. Once I was home, I fell asleep inspired by their vulnerability and strength.I spent the months that followed struggling to find ways to incorporate my mom and sister\\'s example of strength into my life. As I led club meetings and wrote articles, I grew uncomfortable with the persona I had on campus. There was a workshop on body image approaching, and I was feeling nervous. I had led the same workshop a year before with a polished powerpoint and an academic handout, but this year I couldn\\'t bring myself to hide behind them. Instead, I decided to be honest. When I opened the workshop, I shared about my struggle to accept my body and asked if anybody could relate. For a moment, no hands went up, and I began to think that I had lost all my credibility as a feminist. But then a girl raised her hand to share that she related. And then another. By the end of the meeting, dozens of girls had authentically shared their own struggles with the group.Since that meeting, my approach to leadership changed dramatically. I had been bound by the gendered notion that leaders had to appear invulnerable; in reality, vulnerability is a form of true strength. I have been working to be more authentic, not only in my leadership, but in my personal life. My efforts on campus to engage others have become far more effective, and I\\'ve become a much more present, centered person. As I think about college and a life of activism, I feel optimistic about sustaining my efforts through authenticity and honesty.\"}, {\"index\": 161, \"new_personal_statement\": \"At 8:16 on a Monday morning, I walked to the front of a classroom in our new yellow school building on Valencia street, and announced to the circle of fellow fourth graders that I was changing my name\\\\u2026 to Jupiter. I do not remember giggles or smiles, but I suspect there was a small sea of faces staring wide-eyed and confused, unsure of what to make of the 5\\'8\\' fourth grader looming in front of them. I do remember, however, the sensation of regret that instantly sprang through my body, wishing I could take it back. But the thought of my father, lying quietly on the too-thin futon bed in our dusty basement gave me courage. The story of my name is commonly told in my household with a rather jolly nostalgia. My mother\\'s Lutheran traditionalism showed through when she objected to my dad\\'s suggestion of naming me Jupiter. They finally settled on Julia\\\\u2014another J name\\\\u2014but my mom insisted on only calling me Evie after my grandmother. Two years earlier, my dad moved to the makeshift bedroom in our basement after filling our living room with boxes of misplaced treasures he found on the street and planned to sell on eBay. Though my mother attributed his actions to his bipolar disorder, my seven-year-old self adored his quirky habits and could not see them as anything but lovable. Yet, in the gloom of the basement my father seemed to lose his vivacity. And when my lanky fourth grade body curled up next to him excitedly and told him of my courageous name change I got a mumbled \\'that\\'s great honey\\' instead of the anticipated enthusiasm.For a week, I moved through the world as a different person, holding myself high in spite of the constant embarrassment hovering just beneath my apparent confidence. Each night I attempted to insight an excitement in my father with the news that I had continued my pursuit of the identity he wished for me. But his reactions continued to be small sentences made up of small words, and an obvious inability to connect.The next Monday as I sat calmly at a rickety wooden table, I did not correct my teacher when he called me Evie. I sat silently and thought of my father, most likely asleep in the basement at home, and accepted that it was time to take back my identity. I knew, even then, that my actions could not change my father\\'s illness, so I could not let his illness change me.For much of my life I have been asked to carry the weight of my father\\'s mental illness on my shoulders, and have done so willingly. Though I have had to learn to put my own health and well being first, as all caretakers must, this self-care is not what makes this story crucial to my being. I do not remember many moments in my life more formative than this one because it was the first time I came to understand that my actions could not cure his illness and his apparent apathy towards me was not a reflection of his love. Even with my limited child\\'s understanding of the world, I could see that my dad was incapable of caring, not that he did not want to. I have had to fight the instinct to be a fixer; I cannot fix his bipolar disorder because illnesses are inseparable from the people themselves. I push myself instead to find comfort and closure in the process of problem solving, rather than the answer. I deeply love my father and will always be in conflict with my relationship to him. Though my childhood has been tainted with complex moments that have taken years to sift through and understand, the mental illness present in my family has shifted my way of thinking for the better.\"}, {\"index\": 162, \"new_personal_statement\": \"My eyes were quickly moving from wall to wall passing over my closest friend sitting across the deceivingly long table. The artificial air conditioning between us seemed to create a barrier stopping the typical flow of words normally shared between us on car rides to Stinson Beach or across the table at our weekend family dinners.Sleep had eluded me the night before as I kept going over and over the impending conversation in my head. In the moment though, nothing could prepare me for firing my best friend.Before joining Elix, a teen-run social incubator, I had no previous aspirations in the business world. When I was put in charge of managing projects that would give high school students around the world resources to create their own change, I was thrown into the water cold. I had always been good at connecting with people and building relationships but I had never been asked to manage people in a formal setting. Needing to build a trusting and intelligent team I looked to my closest friend, John. We were both very excited to start working together. As we started taking on more ventures, I put John in charge of our most important accounts.The jump from a mutual friendship to a manager-employee relationship was difficult on both of us. I had a difficult time asking him to work and he had a difficult time responding to my requests. I thought that our previous friendship would have facilitated our collaboration, but when he stopped responding to emails, failed to distribute weekly progress reports, and didn\\'t show up for meetings, it became clear that something other than ideal had formed. I started to question my own leadership style. All of the other project managers were completing their work and seemed to enjoy doing it. Why was the tension only with John? Was it our friendship? Or something else? It eventually reached the point where the tension between us was way too much and the ventures he was managing were not receiving the quality of work that was expected. Elix was growing quickly and our relationship was not able to keep up. It was clear that if we were going to continue creating change beyond our community, I was going to have to let John go from my team, but I was unsure if we would still be friends. I know that John had enjoyed Elix and valued it as part of his high school experience. What would happen if I took this away from him?I believed in what Elix was trying to accomplish, but would I risk losing my closest friendship in order to see it succeed?When I saw him walk out of the conference room, I was frozen. I wanted desperately to go after him and try to take back what I had said, but I was stuck in my seat, unable to move. As I was sitting there trying to make sense of what just happened, I realized that a line has to be drawn between friendship and work. Just because someone makes a fantastic friend does not mean that he will be a fantastic work colleague. I had to rethink my hiring strategies to focus more on skills and work ethic instead of how I knew them as friends.After John left the team, it marked a clear turning point where Elix was no longer a club of friends, but an actual business where bold change was taking place. I no longer had to worry about tiptoeing the line and working at Elix felt much more natural. Just as Elix has continued to grow, my friendship with John has matured as well. No longer do we have to worry about progress reports and responding to emails; instead, we can focus on spending time at the beach and across the dinner table as we begin our senior year together.One of the things that I enjoy most is bringing people together. Over my time in high school I have utilized this is many different ways. Whether it is starting an after-school band or creating cross-departmental team to build a business curriculum, I can always bring this to the table. One action that makes me the happiest is when my friends come together for \\'family dinners.\\' While it may be hard to imagine a group of high schoolers coming together to sit down at a formal home cooked meal, let me try to explain these wonderful nights. Acid jazz plays quietly in the background. Everyone is standing around the island snacking on a cheese board I prepared earlier in the day. Conversation flows freely from our summer plans to Logic\\'s new album. Tonight\\'s menu is smoked prosciutto wrapped pork with pea risotto, one of my favorites because tonight we are celebrating the end of AP testing. Almost monthly, we like to switch it up from our typical movie night to gather for a formal dinner. These nights are a special time for me where I get to invite everyone over to my house, host, and cook a dinner. These evenings give me a special feeling of responsibility and pride bringing everyone together. Sharing meals with friends and family is a regular occurrence in our home and it has been wonderful to extend this tradition to my friend group. It is very important to me that I am able to take a step back and bring everyone together over good company, conversation, and food. This urge to bring people together really drives a lot of my passions in life. In the medical field, collaboration is extremely important. Without the creation of cross-professional teams, much of what is done would not be possible. I believe that my tendency to bring people together would have great advantages in the medical field. While I might not be able to create new medical teams right now, I can focus on having dinners and bringing together people important to me.Before teaching my first lesson at Soundwaves: Marin City Youth Music Academy, I could feel the nerves poking at my stomach. I desperately wanted to inspire my students the way that my teachers inspired me when I first started taking lessons. Ever since starting piano in the second grade, followed by cello in the third grade, music has been a source of positivity in my life. In addition to developing my skills both my piano and cello instructors encouraged me to find ways to bring music into other aspects of my life. I have played in different groups ranging from a small ensemble at local farmers\\' markets to playing in a full-fledged youth orchestra. These experiences helped me understand the importance of music within a community. So, when a fellow Redwood High School musician offered me a position teaching piano lessons for a new music program, I jumped at the chance.Every Saturday morning I lead a group of six students teaching them basic keyboarding skills and melodies. The first couple lessons were filled with fumbling fingers and wavering attention. One year later, our weekly lessons have grown to eight students and we\\'ve moved from our simple five finger C scales to learning beginning Bach and Mozart classics. While teaching the keyboard basics I have also tried to emphasize the importance of bringing music out into the community by introducing local bands and helping my students find other ways to express their musicality. For example I have used my personal musical connections to bring in groups to talk to the students about expanding their music to other aspects of their life I feel like this is extremely important because many of these kids are growing up in a community where access to arts programs is extremely limited. Having benefitted so much from my own musical experience, I wanted to be able to share my passion with the community around me. Every Saturday I am lucky to spend my morning nurturing and sharing my love of music with my students. One day I hope they will pay it forward.When I started working for the Elix Incubator in October of 2016, we had five employees, no projects, and were working out of our living rooms. Twelve months later I have helped this social incubator become a registered LLC in Delaware, obtain permanent office space, raise over $42,000, and start ventures for over twenty high school groups from the United States, Costa Rica and Thailand. Elix is a group of self motivated high schoolers that wanted to pursue entrepreneurial dreams but were limited because of our age. In turn, we started an incubator geared toward helping teens in a similar situation. As Chief Product Officer of Elix, I manage a team of five project managers and six technical engineers. I\\'m responsible for ensuring that our project managers were adequately trained and provide useful information to our clients. I\\'m also responsible for coordinating the technical needs of our ventures to the tech team. I\\'m most proud of the cross departmental team from project management, marketing, and finance that I created to build out the Elix curriculum. Elix has taught me a lot about delegation, business formalities, and professional relationships. I have had to negotiate contracts with clients maintaining a professional appearance while still reaching certain necessary terms. Going to investor dinners and social events forced me to use the people skills not emphasized in the school classroom. Building the cross departmental team was a big project. It required selecting a high performing group of individuals that had appropriate time available that could work together. I had to inspire loads of collaboration in order to finalize a business curriculum that is both sophisticated and accurate, but would relate to the issues encountered by a teenager starting a business. Working with Elix has made me realize the lack of emphasis of entrepreneurship in high school. Many of the skill that I have to use while working with Elix I had to build from scratch. I believe that it is important for secondary schools to teach these skills because they are extremely useful in more than the parts of life after college.These past two years I have devoted a lot of my time and academic efforts to the AP Capstone program at Redwood. The two year program focuses on teaching research methods and ultimately leads up to an individual research paper completed during senior year. For my senior project, I am focusing on the salmon fishing communities in the Bay Area. This past winter and spring, there was an upwelling in the Northern Pacific Ocean that brought loads of the nutrients to the surface. This has created an abnormal amount of salmon in the waters around the Bay Area and salmon fisherman have been catching more than ever before. I am starting to create a research method that will evaluate the effect of this upwelling on our salmon fishing communities. With a market saturated with salmon, have individual fishermen been able to compete with the large commercial salmon boats? How and where has this created tension within the community and what are some possible outcomes? In order to answer these questions, I am actively collecting data. This includes interviews with practicing fishermen, conversations with the wharf of San Francisco, and collecting environmental data on the makeup of the San Francisco Bay. This class is so wonderful and has allowed me to really indulge myself in a topic that is both reliant on human connections and closely related to science. It has self selected a group of students who are ready to start to learn beyond the classroom. I am very proud to join with them.Being a part of the research gives me a certain purpose. No matter who my research is effecting now, I know that it is adding to the collective knowledge of our communities. I would like to use the resources of a university to research medicine. Part of my desire to be a doctor stems from the enormous amount of undiscovered information. The ability for a community of doctors to work together to solve a problem is so inspiring and something that I would like to do.\"}, {\"index\": 163, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The Sunday brunch was long ago created by the American dad. That fact alone should make you cautious; theAmerican dad is an unpredictable and crafty creature. He invented brunch solely to be commended after helaboured. It was paradoxical, then, when my non-American father decided that our family would join the waffleeating,pancake-hungry members of the Sunday Brunch Club because he simply could not cook. I assumed it wasan attempt to assimilate with American traditions. Since it was hopeless for my mother to start the tradition (shewas South-Korean with as little idea of what it was than my father), that low-risk yet high-reward once-a-weekmeal inevitably became my responsibility.And so, I hunched in front of the computer and researched. Taking advantage of Google as well as my reliablefriends Martha Stewart and Ina Garten, I discovered that eggs, bacon, pancakes, and waffles were traditionalSunday fare. Of course, bacon was a no-no; my entire family is Muslim. Nevertheless, I found an interesting note:the miraculous weekend brunch makes any household behave in a strange, atypical manner. No one dares to say\\'waffles again?\\' or \\'no maple syrup!\\' With a grateful smile and a satisfyingly full belly, everyone thanks the cheflavishly and releases their very best compliments. It was settled. After all, I thought, who wouldn\\'t want to bepraised for what seemed like a small task?It was definitely not a small task. In order to create the perfect batter consistency, I needed to put just enough milk.Too much, and it was runny. Too little, and the clumps created pockets of uncooked flour; definitely not appetizing.Mastering the flipping technique as well as rescuing the pancake at the precise point before it burned was anothertest. \\'Trial and error,\\' I repeatedly announced after weeks of producing almost inedible pancakes. Maple syrupwas our only savior.Fortunately for my family\\'s tastebuds, I got better. My parents eventually saw enough competency to purchase awaffle maker, a mark of my newly-found independence. After that, any recipe that fell into my hands, I created:French toast, omelettes, quiche, and (almost) every type of eggs. It was only until later that I found that instead ofassimilating us into American culture, Sunday brunch became a part of my family\\'s diversity. Born into a practicingIslamic family with a converted South Korean mother and Pakistani father, I call Miami my birthplace; Sydney myentire childhood; and Incheon, South Korea my second home. I learned English first, studied Urdu script, taughtmyself Hangul, and grasped Arabic to read the Qu\\'ran. Unconsciously, American foods weren\\'t the only thingsappearing at our brunch table; I added dishes like Dutch babies, beghrir, tamales, congee, and my favorite,shakshuka: a Tunisian poached egg dish mixed with tomatoes and other spices. My family\\'s diversity enabled meto appreciate foods from across the globe, and my time spent with them during those lazy hours on Sundaymornings symbolized our multifaceted bonds. And, every time I sit in front of the blue light of the computer screento practice for FAMAT and Quiz Bowl competitions, or contact sponsors for the Pre-Med society\\'s non profitorganization, Food52.com becomes my retreat. There\\'s something comforting in the measurements of ingredients,a from-scratch recipe, and the origins of exotic foods like knishes (Yiddish) or kutabi (Azerbaijani). The high stressof cooking and baking, paradoxically, appeased me and, unsurprisingly, developed my self-sufficiency.Sunday brunch is the highlight of the week for me. Every time I hear the oven hum or sniff the musty scent of allpurposeflour, I remind myself of how far my roots expand across the globe, I think of the way a recipe has passedorally or through generations of family recipes, and most importantly, I thank that wily American dad who decidedto invent brunch one Sunday long ago.\"}, {\"index\": 164, \"new_personal_statement\": \"His golden iconic political comb-over mimicked the perfect ocean wave.

Beside him, I was Shrek, choking people with the sight of me. Flashback to fall 2016, sitting in the school conference room, I pointed at Mr. JFK, claiming him as my partner for the 2017 Model UN circuit.

Inevitably, Gina\\'s case will be but a single piece of legislative agenda lying amidst haystacks of agendas on the congressional floor, but Gina will prevail for she is no ordinary constituent. She is none other than the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, prohibiting the use of genetic information in health insurance and employment.But, she yearns for greater responsibility, extending her influence onto the life insurance industry \\\\u2013 my job is to turn her dreams into reality. Contrary to popular belief, the key to success has nothing to do with the title of one\\'s position. Intern or otherwise, the key is to simply do the right thing \\\\u2013 to fearlessly confront challenges, leverage resources and relationships, work hard, and take action.I may not have JFK\\'s good looks, but I\\'d like to think I have his wit.His golden iconic political comb-over mimicked the perfect ocean wave. His chiseled jaw-line cut sharper than his daunting glare. He was the living reincarnation of JFK, Trent Folk: he screamed hard-pressed politics, courageous leadership, and raw potential.Beside him, I was Shrek, choking people with the sight of me. Flashback to 2016, sitting in the school conference room, I pointed at Mr. JFK, claiming him as my partner for the 2017 Model UN circuit. Though Trent had no experience, I was confident that he was worth the investment. That summer, our speeches echoed throughout Trent\\'s garage, as our audience of wrenches and hammers listened to us practicing for the \\'front-room,\\' the debate and speech portion of MUN. The hood of Trent\\'s car was littered with post-it notes of resolutions and strategies, preparing us for the \\'back-room,\\' the negotiations and politicking portion of MUN.Despite our preparation, we were placed in \\'throw-away\\' committees that contained 300-500 people. Even worse, G20 countries routinely touted authority over our assigned countries that held minor real-world influence. But, at the end of each collegiate tournament, Trent and I returned with first-place gavels to add to our school\\'s trophy case.Contrary to popular belief, the key to success has nothing to do with the country one is assigned. The key is simply to be the best delegate \\\\u2013 a delegate who drops his/her desires of winning, focuses on cultivating the relationships that UN was built upon, and immerses his/her passions into discussions. Adaptability and leadership are critical components; MUN is about bringing everyone to the table.\\'We\\'re soaring, flying\\\\u2026\\'My horrible rendition of Disney\\'s High School Musical theme song stirs sleepy delegates awake.\\'And the drones kill innocent children on the streets!\\' The sudden change in tone captivates everyone\\'s attention.With all eyes on me, I begin my official front-room speech: \\'Yemen proposes the transgovernmental networking program in response to terrorism\\\\u2026\\'Though MUN is a simulation, the leadership and public speaking skills I\\'ve gained pushed me to become more civically engaged. I may not have JFK\\'s good looks, but I\\'d like to think I have his wit.When elementary school teachers asked me what I wanted as my superpower, I\\'d always responded with this unconventional power: impressing the ladies. In pursuit of this elusive superpower, I looked for weapons to add to my arsenal.First, I focused on my butt-kicking skill. Mastering Taekwondo, Kendo, and Hapkido through nine years of training, I learned not only how to fight, but also how to meditate and prepare my mind for the romantic battlefield.To accompany my fighting skills, I needed that body. So, I tied the laces of my Saucony shoes and ran them through multiple 5ks until they were entirely brown. Since then, through cross-country, I\\'ve developed calves to die for, which I happily flex for the ladies.To further woo girls, I\\'ve spent countless hours grasping the firm rosewood neck of my guitar. The Martin acoustic guitar mimics my personality with its bright color and deep voice; it\\'s become an extension of me. I strum and sing classic Jason Mraz songs and quirky originals, hoping to make hearts flutter.Finally, in my quest to impress the ladies, I\\'ve honed my survivalist skills, including catching chickens and chopping wood. Regarding the former: there\\'s only one way to correctly catch a chicken. Thanks to years of chasing chickens, I\\'ve discovered the key: one must be assertive and grab its wings before its body. Besides caring for the livestock on my family\\'s farm, every fall, I drag my axe to the ton of wood shipment that we get from our local wood distributor, preparing my family for unpredictable Maryland\\'s winter blizzards. From years of trial and error, I can vouch from personal experience that Ash wood burns best and Beech wood is the hardest to split. So, girls can rest assured that if they were ever to find themselves stranded, I will help to ensure our survival.In college, I hope to hone my talent of impressing the ladies. Perhaps, I\\'ll run for Student Government, plastering my face across campus. Or, I can even learn from insightful professors how to clone puppies \\\\u2013 the possibilities at UC are truly endless. A styrofoam model of Saturn hung over me as I slept. Years later, the model turned into wallpaper decorations of the Trifid Nebula and then into the Muscular System Anatomical Chart. My whole life, I have been surrounded by the life sciences.Beyond my room, I joined my high school\\'s prestigious Science Technology and Research Scholars (STARS) program, eventually I was elected onto the STARS council in charge of organizing science fairs and NIH lectures. Inspired, I joined my school\\'s Science Olympiad team, helping my school to nab States and Regionals. Eventually, my passion for STEM led me to seriously consider pre-med. Ironically, the only thing holding me back from fully committing was something that most people cite as their reason for pursuing medicine. Having the power to save lives also comes with bearing the responsibility of failing to do so. Nevertheless, I figured I had to give the medical field my best shot before deciding whether to commit myself or not.As an intern for the GW Hospital, I spent my summer chasing my mentor, Dr. Yang, around the entire hospital. One particular experience I\\'ll never forget is following Dr. Yang into the operation room (OR). Despite the high-risk lung lobectomy taking place, the doctors seemed unperturbed, calmly explaining to medical students how smoking causes lungs to literally turn black. Soon, after the surgery, I found my own hands in the da Vinci robotic machine that the previous surgeons had used for the surgery. I was absolutely amazed by how the machine could peer inside into a patient\\'s internal organs and display them on a 3D screen so clearly that it was as if everything was right in front of me. As a result of my GW Hospital internship, a significant educational opportunity, I am absolutely certain premed is what I want to pursue. The composure displayed by the surgeons I worked with encourages me not to be afraid of the great power that comes with the medical profession, but to be driven by this great responsibility instead, in order to make a difference in others\\' lives.Teachers, students, and administrators stared blankly at me. Behind me, etched in white chalk, read \\'STUDY CIRCLES.\\'\\'Welcome!\\'Cue: dead silence. Even the staff members didn\\'t want to be in that room. But, my mission was to make people want to be in Room 206. As a facilitator for Study Circles, a program created by the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) Equity Initiative Unit, I\\'m tasked with leading sensitive conversations about racist, sexist, and/or homophobic bias within the school environment. Located just outside the Capitol Beltway, Montgomery County is known for its wealth and great education system, however the county is not as homogenous as it seems. Through Study Circles, I\\'ve heard stories of elementary schoolers returning home to find that their families had been deported, middle schoolers being bullied for their sexual orientation, and high schoolers attempting suicide because they had no one to turn to. Thus, I don\\'t view Study Circles as an obligation, but as an opportunity to travel across the county and heal the scars of discrimination. And, so, here I was, facilitating difficult conversations at Damascus High School.Initially, everyone in Room 206 was reluctant to share their experiences, but all it really takes is one person to spur a conversation. So, I started the discussion with a few ice breakers, easing everyone\\'s natural trepidation. An hour in, Dairen, a junior, began expressing how he felt left out of the school community because of de facto discrimination: \\'Everyone sits with people who look like them during lunch. It may as well be racial segregation.\\'\\'So, let\\'s think of ideas to solve this problem,\\' I suggested.For the rest of the afternoon, we brainstormed and developed plans, including collaborating with the SGA to create a Lunch Mixer Event, placing different grades and different races into small \\'family-style\\' groups.By lunchtime, Room 206 was buzzing with life, all its occupants excited to be a part of the Study Circles movement. And, though we can\\'t eliminate implicit and explicit bias overnight, we can work together to improve the status quo, one circle at a time. \"}, {\"index\": 165, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Before I even started school, my favorite books to read were the Berenstain Bears stories. The adventures of those four bears and their interactions with the world around them\\\\u2014\\'Bear Country,\\' it was called\\\\u2014 helped to shape my childhood. But the extent of the Bears\\' influence on me during these developmental years wasn\\'t quite clear until I sat down to write this essay. Specifically, this influence came in the shape of one Queenie McBear.Here\\'s how her story goes: one day, Queenie, a new kid, shows up on the playground and begins mocking Sister Bear, the youngest Berenstain, for everything she has. Queenie has hoop earrings; Sister has hair ribbons. Queenie has fashionable clothes; Sister has the same pink jumper she\\'s always worn. Queenie has the latest mountain bike; Sister has a tricycle. Sister is made to feel hyper-aware of the differences between herself and Queenie, and the story follows her struggles to cope with this new feeling of inadequacy. Reading this book, half of my five-year-old self knew what Queenie was doing and representing was bad, but another part of me looked at her and thought: wow, she\\'s kind of cool.This idolization of those who have more has been ingrained in me since childhood, but not just because of Queenie McBear. Society, in all of its various guises, dupes people into thinking that we aren\\'t good enough just because we don\\'t have enough. We are surrounded by the fetishization of wealth and privilege and live in a world that trains its members to envy those who have more and to disdain those who have less.As a faculty kid at a private school, the upper class is right there in front of me; my sense of economic normality has consequently been skewed by this environment. For much of my life, I allowed that sense of inferiority and resentment to control me. I tried to hide the fact that I was receiving financial aid, becoming desperate with keeping up the pretense of my family being \\'normal,\\' that is to say, ultra-privileged. When my mother lost her job during my freshman year, and we entered a period of real financial difficulty, my paranoia increased and this game of pretend started to consume my whole existence. I became afraid to invite friends over for fear they would see my tiny, shared room. I dreaded dress-down days because that meant I\\'d have to wear my Target clothes. Just like Sister Bear, I found myself questioning everything I had once loved so genuinely: my simple clothes, my small house, and eventually, myself.By the end of my junior year, I realized this path I was on was causing me to erase the person that I\\'d always been. Instead of begrudging others their privilege, I had to take stock of my own and ask: if I didn\\'t want people to judge me for what I had, what did I want them to see?I decided to devote my being to the pursuit of daily excellence on a human scale. I realized that I was most myself when fully immersed in my work, whether printing in the darkroom, editing the school magazine, or competing for my sailing team. I\\'ve never allowed myself to do things halfway; instead, I put everything I can into each little thing I do, because doing good work matters. If there\\'s any wealth my parents passed down to me, it\\'s the chance to prove to myself that I am enough.And how do things end up back in Bear Country? Sister Bear reaffirms her sense of self through winning her school\\'s double dutch competition. By doing something she\\'s always loved, she reclaims what she was once ashamed of. Likewise, owning who I am and what I have is my own double dutch victory.English has always been my favorite subject. I eagerly take on essays and timed writings, and often finished reading assignments well before they\\'re due. My grades in English reflect that I excel in that subject, but when asked if I had a creative talent I used to always answer \\'no, not really\\'. Because I\\'m not great at drawing, singing, or playing an instrument\\\\u2014all of these being what I saw as \\'proper\\' artistic talents\\\\u2014I never considered my writing as a true creative pursuit. Sure, I could write an passable poem in a short amount of time, but compared to my dad\\'s paintings or my mom\\'s knitting, I told myself I wasn\\'t a creative person. Writing was something everybody could do, I thought. I\\'m not that special. It wasn\\'t until this past summer that I realized I\\'d been taking my writing talent for granted. I was sitting in a coffee shop, deep in thought as I listened to music and sipped at a steaming cup. As I looked out the window at passersby, lulled into an almost trance-like state by my music, I knew I wanted to somehow preserve this moment of tranquility. I picked up my pen and opened my notebook to a blank page, trying my hardest to translate these feelings into images. Only able to generate a few questionably people-shaped blobs, I grew frustrated. How could I possibly translate my feelings into art if I couldn\\'t draw? The only way I could think to do this was through words\\\\u2014and maybe that was it! As I started writing out my feelings on a fresh page, I was struck by how easily they came to me. I accepted words as a vessel for my creativity. This realization opened my eyes to the fact that words were a valid way of expressing my emotions. Writing is my own art, my own translation of these moments of impassioned creativity into something tangible. I don\\'t have to be able to draw or paint or even sing to express my creative side, because I\\'ve found and embraced the power of my words. I never thought I\\'d be teaching a class as a high school student, but becoming the Editor in Chief (E.I.C.) of my school\\'s student-run magazine entailed exactly that.While my freshman self didn\\'t join with the goal of E.I.C. in mind, I was always aware of the unique leadership styles demonstrated by each senior in the position. When applications for next year\\'s leadership positions opened in my junior year, I went in with what I thought to be a fairly in-depth understanding of an E.I.C.\\'s duties. Aside from occasional guidance from our faculty advisors, I was expected to lead and manage both the direction of the magazine and class. What I didn\\'t realize until I had a few weeks under my belt were the nuances that came with these duties. Leading class meant that I had to learn to balance treating fellow students as peers and as staffers. At first I struggled to discipline the class, reluctant to appear as the \\'boss\\' of students\\\\u2014many of whom were and are my close friends. I didn\\'t want to risk the dislike of peers for the sake of the magazine, so my first few weeks became characterized by staffers taking advantage of my leniency. The situation got to the point where people were neglecting deadlines, not editing articles, and generally slacking off. It was then that I realized I had to learn to be both a manager and a classmate. I talked with the class as a whole about what was wrong, and instead of blaming them I made my role in this clear: if I had established myself more firmly from the start, this could have been avoided. Good leadership, I learned, meant accepting responsibility and still being able to move forward with a positive outlook. I lead The Scribe knowing exactly what I want my leadership to be defined by. It\\'s not important that people see me as a strict editor; rather, it\\'s that my staffers respect me as a leader while continuing to trust me as a friend.When I enter the darkroom, I\\'m meet with the strong smell of chemicals that seep out of the still blackness. At first, the sulfur from the \\'fixer\\'\\\\u2014a solution of thiosulfate salt used to fix images on paper\\\\u2014is an almost offensive scent, but it slowly grows on me as I go through the familiar motions of developing photographs. The room is quiet, save for the soft ripples of water that are stirred up as I cycle my print through chemical baths. Though I started only a year ago, film photography is an essential part of my life. My school\\'s photo lab is where I feel most creative, and when I\\'m not there I\\'m daydreaming about different photography projects I want to undertake, or famous styles I wish to emulate. I actively seek out any opportunity to incorporate my love of photography into other areas of life, and the perfect chance to do so came in the form of a research paper for A.P. U.S. History last year. The instructions were to write about a post-WWII change in California, so I took that prompt and spun it into something I felt I would enjoy: post-war photography movements in Southern California. I fell even more in love with photography as I researched, and I began to understand that this art form was about so much more than just taking pretty pictures. I came across photographers who embodied the post-war attitude of the nation and wordlessly conveyed elaborate, striking statements through their work. My final product ended up being centered around New Topographic photography, a movement serving as commentary on the suburban explosion in the post-war West. I\\'d still gladly wax poetic on this topic today, whether it be about the history behind each image or the unique styles of each artist I featured. I encountered the work of some of my favorite photographers to date through my research project\\\\u2014Lewis Baltz, Bill Owens\\\\u2014and this paper gave me the insight to not only love, but also appreciate, the art of photography. As a 10 year old, the thing that terrified me the most was going to sailing practice. Each Friday night I tried my best to feign a stomach bug, strep, or anything that would allow me to stay home, but without fail I found myself walking into the sailing center each Saturday morning. I wasn\\'t scared of the ocean itself, or even of sailing; rather, it was the fact that practices consisted of me, alone in a small boat, fending for myself against the wind and waves. There was this terrible feeling of dread I\\'d get in my stomach whenever our coach told us, \\'it\\'s gonna be a windy one, kids!\\', and I\\'d be relieved when we\\'d break for lunch.Fast forward eight years, and I sail every weekend and am the Varsity M.V.P. of my team. I attribute this drastic change in attitude to the change in sailing environments. When I first started, I desperately wanted to avoid the deep sense of shame I associated with being the oldest sailor in the beginners\\' group. Moving to San Diego introduced me to a sailing world entirely different from the one I entered in Miami. In this new environment, I thrived. I practiced with my high school and club team, and started competing non-stop. Pouring this amount of energy into a sport can be exhausting, but I\\'ve learned that what I put into something equals what I\\'ll get out of it. I recently accomplished one of my biggest sailing goals\\\\u2014being named to an elite racing team\\\\u2014which became cause for some congratulatory self-reflection. How did I go from being a petrified beginner to a varsity racer who lives for their sport? It often surprises me how far I\\'ve come in sailing, but what is more surprising is that I used to entertain thoughts of never sailing again. My sport has become an integral part of who I am, and achieving what I have has only strengthened my desire to improve\\\\u2014I consider sailing the greatest of my talents, but I don\\'t see that classification as any reason to stop developing it. \"}, {\"index\": 166, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I had initially hoped that \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018The Flying Shack\\' was named ironically. To my dismay, \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018shack\\' was a more than apt description of the small, lazily painted hut through which I was to begin flying lessons. As it happened, not only the construction of the shack seemed to be outdated. Upon being greeted by my instructor, I was called \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018adorable\\', stared at, and asked whether I was at his \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018robust establishment\\' that day as a one-off birthday present. In fact, he only began to discuss starting proper lessons with me once my father stepped into the office with us.I had had my doubts about learning to fly even prior to this experience. I had questioned whether I was ready to inherit this rich tradition both of resilient women of the past, and of men in my family who had fought in wars before my time. But it was at this very moment when I decided to be a pioneer. I would not leave that day as many would, disheartened and demoralised. Instead, I spent that evening researching and drawing inspiration from women such as Amy Johnson, Bessie Coleman, and Amelia Earhart, women who through aviation rose above context and convention and found their voices alongside their wings. My first flying lesson left me empowered and emboldened. So much so, I decided to become an ambassador for the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018International Women of Aviation Worldwide\\' initiative, finding a community which I could belong to and find connection with.Learning to fly sparked a period of both intense personal growth, and my realisation that the only satisfying way to pursue an opportunity is as a fearless pioneer.Reflecting on the steps taken by women before me, I knew then to use the resources I have been given, in life and in school, and build on them to cultivate my own success- flying planes and taking names. Whether it is the dull roar of an engine, quaking beneath me, or of conversation around me, I am invigorated by any opportunity to challenge convention. In the classroom, I aim to make parallels and connections, to be controversial, unafraid to contribute and speak out.Not only have I deserted convention by being female in a male-dominated field, I have often deserted convention in opinion. Undertaking writing an Extended Essay on Ancient Greek literature, unprecedented in my school, I learned to question and refute much of what I read. Through this, I appreciated the value of forming fresh opinions of my own, along with unique, insightful angles from across my comprehensive and interdisciplinary curriculum. I have deserted convention by controlling my own narrative. More literally by writing plays and poems, but also by taking leadership roles such as being Head Girl of my school, and directing my own interpretation of Hamlet. Unabashedly, I forge my own path using my distinct brand of creative vision. Staying open, adaptable, and as authentically myself as I can be, I bring my unquenchable, pioneering spirit to every situation. Surprisingly, I only really learned the value of collaboration through my commitment to leadership. After all, what is a pilot without the voice on the other end of the radio, the man at the fuelling station, the woman beside you in the cockpit? Being open-minded and accepting ideas from others- in aviation, theatre, or class- I came to understand fully the value of diversity in opinion and perspective.When I first walked into \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018The Flying Shack\\', my ambitions were dismissed as \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018adorable\\'. How could some girl with a penchant for Greek syntax and a cappella singing lift a plane off the ground? Well, flying has shown me that being comfortable and passive is not something in my DNA. One can and will go places through channeling hard work into subverting expectation, abandoning convention, and proving that the sky should never be the limit, but home.\"}, {\"index\": 167, \"new_personal_statement\": \"On Being a Hot Dog Over the past few years, I have waited rather impatiently for an age at which my existence makes a little more sense.

I play the princesses while my dad fills supporting roles, transforming from a talking teapot to an evil queen, an ally to an enemy. Acting out fairy tales at the playground was my first foray into creating a world, but it was far from my last. Long after most kids abandoned \\'make-believe,\\' I drafted friends for re-creations of my favorite stories. When I discovered this was not an original idea but an age-old art, I was hooked; by six, I knew I wanted to spend my life making theater. Every time I watched or directed a play, I felt that thrill I\\'d had at the playground of being two places at once. My parents don\\'t share my interest in theater, but my love of world-building is inherited. After we had finished playing Snow White, my dad would sneak away, creating a different kind of alternate universe. In his, he was having an affair that led to the birth of my half-brother, Max. Though the affair soon ended, he continued to see Max, a relationship he kept secret. Like me, my dad existed in two parallel worlds. But while I loved when the universes I created onstage informed my real life, he wanted desperately to keep his two worlds from colliding. Eventually they did; my mom and I discovered my dad\\'s secret life. The day he moved out, I crouched in my bathroom, listening to the soundtrack of Fun Home, a musical about memoirist Alison Bechdel\\'s relationship with her father, Bruce. I\\'d long recognized my own dad in Bruce\\\\u2014brilliant, deceitful, simultaneously supportive and scathing\\\\u2014but now the score became my lifeline. I leaned on Alison\\'s strength when I had none, hoped that if she could find clarity, one day I could too. But a few months later, when I was given the opportunity to intern on the show, I was forced to fully confront what I had been avoiding: the TV onstage didn\\'t actually work; we were in Times Square, not the Bechdels\\' Pennsylvania town; and \\'Bruce,\\' though based on a real person, was not a tyrant but a gentle, goofy actor. My father\\'s invented worlds had shattered me, and yet I was seeking solace in fabrication. I was disgusted that the musical that had saved me shared so much with the betrayal that had almost destroyed me. Even worse, I felt like my love of theater linked me to my dad, revealing that deceit was in my DNA; he was the one who had taught me to create universes out of jungle gyms. I needed an answer to Alison\\'s opening number question: \\'Dad, am I just like you?\\' The answer came during rehearsal, as I watched the cast perform the show. I knew every word, but this time I was struck by the scene in which Bruce, teaching 5-year-old Alison to draw, tells her that the cartoon map she has made is childish. The young Alison is heartbroken, but the older Alison, now a successful cartoonist, ignores her dad\\'s critique and draws the map anyway, using the skills he taught her even as she differentiates herself from him. As Alison sang \\'maps show you what is simple and true,\\' I realized that theater is my map. My dad can be both talking teapot and evil queen, my ally and my enemy; like Alison, I can take what he gave me and use it differently, inventing worlds not to lie but to find truth. I\\'m still angry at my father, still struggling to decipher him. So I direct a scene or read a play and I try to understand him. I use parallel universes to reach truth in the real one. I make maps. And for all he has done to hurt me, it is my father who taught me how to draw.In tenth grade, my school\\'s Mock Trial team was composed mainly of seniors. That meant we were a strong, experienced team, capable of winning city championships. It also meant that when those seniors graduated, our team really felt their absence. As the lawyer captain for the 2016 season, it was my job to guide the team through what I knew would be a difficult year. I worked late nights and lunches, training novice lawyers while struggling with my own closing statement and cross examination. Every time I felt like giving up, I remembered how exhilarating it had felt to win and worked harder still. So when we got destroyed in our first trial, I was crushed. Worse, though, was the team\\'s reaction. We stormed out of the courtroom, glared at each other, blamed our teammates and coaches. Win or lose, our team had always gone out afterwards for Chinese food, but now most people skipped it. As I nibbled on my dumplings, I wondered if this was my fault\\\\u2014maybe if I hadn\\'t been so obsessed with winning, losing wouldn\\'t feel so bad. The next day, the witness captains and I called a meeting. I knew I needed to renew the team\\'s confidence, but didn\\'t know what to do besides parrot our coaches\\' favorite saying: \\'We win as a team and lose as a team.\\' But when I said the words out loud, words that had always felt trite, they rang surprisingly true. As I spoke, I realized that what made winning great was that we all shared every victory. I told my teammates that Mock Trial was too hard and scary to do alone. I looked each one in the eye as I said \\'we need to have each others\\' backs.\\' After the meeting, I sought out everyone who\\'d felt blamed for our loss and listed the best objections and arguments they\\'d made. I made \\'we win as a team and we lose as a team\\' my motto. And when I found out we wouldn\\'t advance, I arranged for us to all get Chinese food together. This time, everybody came.There are few things I love more than making gingerbread houses. I\\'m a master at melting butterscotch into stained-glass; I pride myself on my ice-cream cone trees, my powdered sugar snow and my lifesaver wreaths. Every year, my mom and I devote days to baking, assembling and decorating a candy winter wonderland, and every year our houses get more and more elaborate.  I like making gingerbread houses because they\\'re cute, because they\\'re my favorite family tradition and because there\\'s always delicious candy involved. Most of all, though, I like making gingerbread houses because I like building worlds.  That love of world-building is also why I love directing theater; I\\'m happiest when I\\'m creating an alternate reality simply by adjusting a light or staging a moment or analyzing a line of text. When I start working on a play, all I have is a group of actors and a pile of papers, but by the end of the process, the show is a parallel universe. Directing allows me to live in two worlds at once.  Making theater, like making a gingerbread house, involves quick thinking and problem-solving. It demands attention to every detail, no matter how small. It\\'s hard and frustrating and takes a tremendous amount of trial and error. But when I step back and see the universes I\\'ve created\\\\u2014the gingerbread house with its butterscotch windows or the world onstage inhabited by fully alive characters\\\\u2014I know all I want to do is begin all over again.   I have an irrational hatred of red peppers. I\\'m not allergic to them, and I have no problem with green or yellow peppers, but their red relatives I find completely intolerable. So a few months ago, when I was having dinner with my best friend Izzy and her family, I was dismayed to see her mom dicing red pepper. Then Izzy leaned over. \\'Don\\'t worry,\\' she whispered, \\'I told her you didn\\'t like them and she\\'s going to put them on the side.\\' In that moment, I knew that Izzy had been listening to me and watching out for me, could tell that she was there for me no matter what. It was such a small gesture, but it made me feel so safe and so valued. Since that night at Izzy\\'s house, I have made it my mission to learn the little things that make my friends happy. When my friend Eleanor is sad, I know to buy a bottle of sunscreen because, for some mysterious reason, applying sunscreen calms her down. Hazel, who\\'s wildly indecisive, needs me to help her make a pros and cons list over chocolate milkshakes. Every time Adelle is stressed, we watch The Twilight Zone until she\\'s too scared to be anxious. And if Jacob just got exciting news, I pick up my phone and get ready to scream with joy. I think I have a natural talent for knowing what people need, but only recently have I felt responsible for filling those needs. It takes almost no effort to remember someone\\'s favorite song or least favorite movie; all I have to do is pay attention to them and remember what I notice. But I hope that by giving that attention to the people I love, I can help to make my friends and family feel as cared for and valued as I did that night at Izzy\\'s house.The moment I walked into my math class, I could tell something was wrong. My friend Ashley, always cheerful, looked anxious. Nina, the diligent note-taker who sits in front of me, hadn\\'t even opened her backpack. And Matthew, goofy, go-with-the-flow Matthew, had his head on his desk. After class, Ashley told me what had happened: our classmates had seen the Facebook group chat that Matthew and eight other boys had been part of. They said the chat was filled with unspeakably racist, sexist, and homophobic messages, and they had the screenshots to prove it. These boys, my friends for years, had spent months degrading and dehumanizing half of our grade. Everyone at school was stunned. My friends and I cried in class, lower-termers walked around looking horrified, and even teachers were too upset to teach. I\\'d never seen my classmates, many of them women, people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community, look so defeated. That night, I looked for some comfort in the script of one of my favorite plays, Sarah DeLappe\\'s The Wolves. The Wolves follows a high-school-girls\\' soccer team as they cope with crises big (a teammate\\'s death) and small (a big zit). They tease, support and fight with each other, they win and they lose. They also never stop training. The girls on the team are paragons of physical and emotional strength, and in the wake of the chat leaks my schoolmates desperately needed to feel strong. So I asked some friends how they would feel about a school trip to see The Wolves. When they responded enthusiastically, I emailed the chair of the English department. She too loved the idea. Now, she and my principal are working to procure tickets for up to a hundred juniors and seniors. My community is nowhere close to healed, and I know this play won\\'t solve all of our problems. But I do hope that when my classmates see the play\\'s final scene, watch the girls scream \\'we are the wolves,\\' some of the characters\\' strength will rub off on us.\"}, {\"index\": 169, \"new_personal_statement\": \"It was around 6:30 in the evening when I filed onto the train to go back to my host family\\'s apartment in Shibuya. As I untangled my earphones in my seat, I noticed a little girl, clutching her mother\\'s hand, gasp at the sight of my dark skin and box braids, as though she\\'s never seen anyone who looks quite like me before. A cause of great discomfort just a few weeks prior, I shook it off as a normal part of being agaikokujin,or a foreigner, in Japan. Being an outsider was one of the things I was afraid of when I decided this past March to study abroad in Tokyo for my senior fall. Although Tokyo was a giant city, Japan\\'s homogeneity was glaring in most places I went, so while I was used to being a minority, I\\'d never quite been a rarity. Besides sticking out in the crowd, a thousand other worries flew through my head.What if my host family doesn\\'t like me? How am I going to have a sense of humor in Japanese? What if the kids in my classes never talk to me?Although I came to Japan because I liked Japanese language, food, fashion, and media, I also liked to know my place, and how to operate within it.As the train slowed to the second stop, Eifukucho, I thought about the last time I\\'d been truly out of my comfort zone. When I first went to boarding school, I called my mother during my first week crying about how I thought I\\'d never get used to such a strange, new place. But just two years later and here I was using my dodgy train Wi-Fi in Japan to snapchat my friends at my \\'second home.\\' I knew that to come to Japan would be to challenge my idea of home and my perception of the world, but because boarding school had already done that, it wasn\\'tsobad the second time around.I got up as my train began to slow to my transfer, and waited impatiently with everyone else for the door to open. I walked with purpose up the escalator, attempting to show everyone that I had a place to be and that I knew exactly how to get there. I was only going home tonight, but I\\'d already seen the Cup Noodle museum in Yokohama, Buddhist temples in Kamakura and Nara, and kabuki theater in Ginza.It was a time of firsts, and slowly but surely, Japan was starting to feel more and more like home. Finally around 7:15, I saw my home station come into view, along with my local convenience stores, restaurants, and other small shops. As I walked out of my station into the street, I watched mothers pushing their babies in strollers, businessmen walking with less stress than in the morning, and other tired teenagers aching to take their school uniforms off. Before Japan, it was so hard for me to fathom the idea of a place I\\'d never been to being perhaps all someone has ever known. But living here for two and a half months made the world feel more intimate, something I wouldn\\'t have been able to see if I\\'d simply been tourist for a few weeks. As I walked in the door of my home, I yelled out \\'Tadaima!\\'to my host mother, signaling my arrival. I plopped onto the couch next to my host sister, sighing in relief at a day coming to a close. Going to Japanese school was fun, but those hour commutes to and from were tiring! As I waited for dinner to be ready, I wondered what I\\'d be doing the next time I was out of my comfort zone, because right now, I was feeling pretty good. \"}, {\"index\": 170, \"new_personal_statement\": \"As soon as I heard Ms. Cheung introduce herself, my head turned, and my eyes lit up. While I was used to hearing Cantonese in passing in Hong Kong, Mandarin was something completely different. Its sound somehow had the tenderness of a lullaby but the intensity of a battle cry. Instantly captivated by this peculiar language, I spent the whole weekend perfecting my intonation. The following Monday, I skipped into class excited to show off what I thought was a unique superpower. That day, everyone in class 3B was gleefully greeted with \\'Ni Hao!\\'  Mandarin was just one of these moments for me. It also happened with my other languages - German, Spanish, and Latin. At first, studying different languages simultaneously was tough \\\\u2013 I sat in German class, trying to comprehend the endless declensions, distinguishing a weak verb from a strong one, and correctly identifying gender, and the next minute walked into Mandarin class, where such grammar rules were unheard of. But becoming comfortable with the drastic differences between each was worth the struggle. I like to think of learning a language as being given a key to a locked door. By travelling, and integrating with communities outside my own, I am using that key to open doors. When I travelled to Germany and eagerly embarked on a German immersion course, I stepped out into the cobbled back alleyways and felt an immediate sense of liberation. I was free to traverse the spirited streets of Berlin; hearing native Berliners chat with each other helped improve my articulation. Observing daily routines helped me understand the lifestyle. The almost tangible aura of unstifled creativity and bohemian zeal in Kreuzberg inspired me to continue pursuing my love of capturing the raw beauty around me through photography and filmmaking. Learning languages has ironically taught me that words cannot express everything. My project \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Laconic\\', a compilation of my photography and short films, aims to evoke emotion and provoke thought, using as little language as possible. When I travelled to Shanghai, language again provoked emotion as, instantly recognizable as a foreigner, people were shocked when I replied to them in Mandarin. Encouraged by their smiles, I felt a connection in every encounter. The barriers of cultural comprehension broke down; a shared language had brought us together. Breaking free from the barriers of cultural comprehension has always been important to me, but this is not just limited to my foreign languages. I joined Eton\\'s Feminism Society (FemSoc) because I discovered there is a problem in my school: the issue of gender equality is not talked about enough among students, teachers and the local community. I\\'ve noticed the common misconceptions associated with feminism, the most common of which being feminists seek to promote female domination at the expense of men. How can we solve this problem, when the very definition of the issue is constantly misconstrued? Through discussion, through language, through action.The first step to fight misogyny is to educate. Every Wednesday, FemSoc provides a safe space for the school community to voice their beliefs and to listen to the opinions of others. I am currently in contact with members of the St Mary\\'s Ascot Feminism Society, an all-girls school equally committed to the promotion of feminism. Through discussion, boys at Eton will have the chance to hear about the real-life experiences of girls growing up in a female-dominated environment. Through FemSoc, I am determined to help lead a better-informed community against everyday sexism, to help break down the barriers existing in today\\'s society. The ever-increasing inter-connectivity in today\\'s world constantly fuels my desire to continue opening doors and breaking down cultural and linguistic barriers. Globalisation often leads to a collision of worlds, but with a mastery of Chinese and German, as well as other languages I\\'ll study in the future, I hope to transform these collisions into opportunities, from which I can learn and grow.\"}, {\"index\": 171, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Revolution: it was a strange concept to grasp as a seven-year-old obsessed with The Hunger Games, but nineyears later, I saw one for myself in Kashmir.I watched my 19-year-old cousin hold back tears as she described her helplessness \\\\u2014 her life confined to herhome because of daily curfews, enforced after protests against youth shot.

An outsider wouldn\\'t give much thought to it - they probably wouldn\\'t ever see it at all. But if you stood on your tippy toes and reached to the top shelf, took down the bin and blew off the decade of dust, you\\'d find the remnants of a world that exists only in the very limits of my imagination. Indeed, this inconspicuous container practically overflows with the colorful, magical dress-up supplies of my childhood. Pirate swords, princess tiaras, and secret agent gear were my lifelines, truly the defining characteristics of my youth. No one played pretend like I did.This wasn\\'t necessarily a quality that made me incredibly popular in elementary school. If you wanted to play pretend with me, you had to have a detailed character analysis. If you are a princess, what kind of gloves are you wearing? What color is your dress? What\\'s your princess\\' favorite food, and what does she think about the meaning of life? If I was going to construct a fantasy world of my own devising, I had to be able to fully immerse myself in it. One might call this an unhealthy obsession, but I called it an exceptionally active imagination.As I moved through high school, something in me shifted, prompting me to think differently about the made-up characters. They had always been manifestations of solely my own imagination, but thensome undefinable thing drew me to instead look to the stories of real people who lived on this earth, people who had their own narratives to tell. I became engrossed in the study of history. The fantastic realization that there is an infinite world of stories and characters out there sparked within me a determination to understand as much as I could about it.In my mind lies a plethora of facts, dates, and names. Slivers of time are shoved into every cranny of my brain. I can hardly close my eyes without seeing scenes of ancient battles and historic moments flicker on the back of my eyelids. I don\\'t count sheep at night anymore; now I recite the names and dates of things that would generally only matter to you if you are older than 200. August twentieth, four hundred and eighty before the common era - the Battle of Thermopylae. June twenty-sixth, seventeen hundred and twenty-one common era - the first smallpox inoculation on the American continent. I hardly remember the date of my own birthday, but I can rattle off details all the way down to the weather forecast for events that happened centuries ago.History is what\\'s right out of the corner of your eye. It\\'s like chasing someone and finding out that you just missed them. It\\'s longing for someone you\\'ve never met, and having nostalgia for memories that aren\\'t yours. When I turn a tattered yellow page, the ghosts of the past whisper to me. I rarely listen to them. They hardly ever agree with each other. Still, I don\\'t mind it. It\\'s a familiar comfort.And it sometimes feels funny that I can call these ghosts \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018familiar.\\' But every person that I study once had a favorite color, loved someone, hated someone, lost something they just put there, watched the clouds in the sky, and had an infuriatingly catchy song stuck in their head. Robespierre once wrote an ode to jam tarts and Aaron Burr splurged on the purchase of a coconut. These seemingly insignificant details shape us into who we are, whether they\\'re recorded in history or not. The transformation from a little girl who loves to play dress-up into a scholar with obsessed with the past hinged on the acceptance of that fact: that people are people, and that those who choose to learn about them will always have an endless story to explore.They say that, if you can see a tsunami wave on the horizon, you are too close to escape it. As a seventh grader, I saw my mom wear mismatched shoes to work. At the time, I didn\\'t realize that that was the tsunami on the horizon.My mother was diagnosed with Frontotemporal Dementia in 2013. It was a wave siphoning all of my familiar waters. And I, on the brink of adolescence, was helpless: helpless to stop it, helpless to resist, helpless to do anything but run to higher ground and wait for the water to crash over everything that I once knew.My mother was my best friend as a child. We laughed, talked about elementary school drama, took trips to Disney World, and made pizza on family night. She kissed me goodnight, read stories and went to all of my dance recitals. I could not have asked for a more quintessentially perfect childhood. But a calm before a storm can\\'t last forever.A tsunami wave in the distance doesn\\'t appear to be nearly as powerful as it is. You can hardly believe it\\'s happening. But then, the wave crashes on the shore. And your best friend is drowning in confused speech, and can\\'t focus on her work or even write legibly. She is forced to quit her job because she can\\'t think anymore. She stays in bed all day. I didn\\'t understand, is she unable to get up? Or does she just not want to? Turns out, it was a combination of both.Most people don\\'t become the parent to their parent until they\\'re at least old enough to be an actually have kids themselves. But what do you do when you\\'re in that role as a middle schooler?The water rushes onto the land. The line between the world that I knew and the turbid, gushing water becomes obscured. It overwhelms any structure it passes, destroying it in one blow and whisking away the rubble. My mother\\'s mind continued to deteriorate. I was afraid to share things with her. She couldn\\'t communicate and she would randomly blurt out insults towards me or other people who I knew she once cared for. Her filter was gone, and so was the love or support I once counted on.This particular disease is characterized by the loss of mental and physical abilities, starting with complex decision- making skills and ravaging through the brain, destroying everything until it finally reaches the essential bodily functions, killing you.I ran to higher ground. I didn\\'t talk to anyone about what was happening in my home. If anyone asked about my mother, I told them that she had become a homemaker. It stemmed from self-consciousness about the situation at first, but by high school, it was second nature for me to do anything and everything I could to avoid the subject.My very last memories of her have her withering away in a wheelchair, less than 100 pounds, unable to communicate in any intelligible way, and stuck with a horrible grin plastered on her face because she couldn\\'t control those muscles anymore. I didn\\'t get to be with her when she died. It was the night before my 16th birthday, but I was out of town that week. I didn\\'t cry, and I still didn\\'t tell anyone. I had already shed all the tears I possibly could.Now, the water has finally receded. I had to focus on the repair.I never perceived my life to be that different throughout this ordeal. But I look back and realize how quickly a catastrophic family illness and the grief that followed made me mature, and how I was put in a position where I had to be my own emotional support during those tumultuous high school years. I\\'ll be proud that I faced the tsunami and came out wiser, stronger and more aware of my horizons.\"}, {\"index\": 173, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Tick, Tock, Tick!\\' The clock ticked and soon enough, my heartbeat could be heard doubling the tick of the clock, synchronizing with every downbeat. My eyes burned from straining too long at a piece of paper and my hand was indented from the weight of the pencil. I nervously glanced around the room, and noticed that a few of my classmates had abandoned hope and were sleeping in despair. On the other hand, there remained a few intent individuals who continued working. Determined not be outdone, I quickly resumed my concentration. As the clock ticked, the pressure in the room began accumulating and my heart began to race. I desperately scanned through my work, double and triple checking every line, however, the solution still evaded me. Rubbing my bleary eyes, I sat up, still focused on the paper. Suddenly, in my peripheral vision, I spotted what I was looking for: the final word. Incredulous, I hastily rechecked my answer but the result proved unchanging. I finally had completed my word-search.I have always had a penchant for puzzles. In elementary school, when crossword puzzles and word-searches were frequent assignments done in class, I would race to be the first to finish. As my intellectual capacity progressed, so did the types of puzzles I enjoyed. Word-searches and crossword puzzles soon turned into riddles and rubix cubes and eventually, into Java exercises. Java provided limitless fuel for my thirst of puzzles; so many applications exist that the possibilities are endless. This sort of capability and power piqued my interest and as I learned more, I only became certain that I had finally discovered what I was looking for: the ultimate challenge.I first took an Intensive Introduction to Java Programming course at Harvard University over the summer of 11th grade. At first, there was so much information to process and I was overwhelmed. Even the simplest lines of code were beyond my understanding, yet I remained intrigued. Over the next seven weeks, I eagerly devoured each new piece of information. I spent many late nights watching tutorial videos, reading the textbooks and consulting with fellow classmates over problem sets. In my free time, I explored with various codes and even worked on side projects of my own. These creations performed simple tasks, such as row-reducing a matrix or calculating one\\'s age, and took more work to program than to simply undertake, nevertheless I enjoyed the process. The course consumed the entirety of my time, as I would often find myself pondering which algorithm to implement when in the shower, during meals, and even in the middle of pickup basketball games at the gym. As the weeks passed, all the pieces soon began to fall into place. Each completed program added one more piece to my ongoing puzzle of Java and my knowledge grew bit by bit. It was not long before I could begin to fully understand and write my own complete programs. Then, in no time, these simple codes evolved into more complicated programs such as a Battleship game client, a Sudoku Solver and Binary Tree iterators. From there, I never looked back. From this, I learned to take everything piece by piece and set small goals, just like when solving a puzzle. It is too easy to get lost looking at the big picture, so I remain focused on the little things. When times get tough, I remember to keep trodding along, placing the pieces one by one, steadily making progress. This has always been my strategy for completing puzzles, and has now translated to all things I do in life, including programming. Flash-forward to my senior year. I am back in the classroom again, racing to complete a challenge against a group of friends. The situation is oddly reminiscent. However this time, instead of a word-search, it is a Java exercise and this time, I will finish first.One chilly April morning, while other people were still buried in the warmth of their bed, I was in the woods with my buddy, Will. We were on a mission to catch turtles, one that we had planned for hours on before deciding upon a satisfactory plan.Once inside the forest, I felt the call of adventure in my blood. I was unstoppable, ready to take on any obstacle. As we started our journey, the icy winds blew harder, seemingly to obstruct us. We climbed over many hills and through many bushes, under many valleys and over many streams. My feet ached from trekking and my hands were all scratched up from stray branches. Finally, after a backbreaking journey, we managed to reach the cherished destination: a thin, trickling creek. However, our journey had only just begun. I encountered a variety of fish and the occasional reptile, but the elusive turtles were nowhere to be found. The water was ice-cold and my feet were freezing, yet I continued with only one thought in mind: turtles. My determination was soon rewarded. Entrenched in the shallow edges of the creek and camouflaged by his surroundings, laid a small turtle. I carefully approached and picked him up. After a brief contemplation, we decided upon the name, Oliver, because of his olive-greenish color. Oliver came with us on the trip back, and remained largely unconcerned about his imprisonment. In fact, he held his head up high in confidence, as to look forward towards his uncertain future. Over the course of the next few days, I started to rethink this incident. What if Oliver missed his home? What if he was scared out of his shell? I struggled with this dilemma for days. One particular night, I laid in bed, tossing and turning, before realizing that deep down, I had always known what to do. I had to return Oliver back. So the next day, I called my friend and convinced him of my worries. Once again, we prepared to make the arduous hike. This time, the trip to the secluded home of Oliver went by quickly, perhaps because I was lost in thought, thinking of Oliver. Although I had not known him long, I knew that it would be a difficult farewell. When it was finally time to let him go, my eyes began to water, and it was not because of the rain.To this day, Oliver remains a symbol of confidence. During times of hardship, I reflect upon Oliver\\'s resiliency. More importantly, this adventure is one of many that has shaped my development. I am not afraid to try anything new and welcome any challenges. As a result, I\\'ve had my share of ups and downs and have experienced emotions on the far ends of the spectrum. I have laughed, cried, and done both at the same time. These experiences have imparted on me the joy of discovery, as well as the tears of pain and farewell. I have scuba dived in the depths of the ocean, bungee jumped off sky-high platforms, and gotten lost in the mountains. I have lived in the rural countrysides of China, taught English to young children, and played my violin in the busy streets of downtown. Although I do take my academics very seriously, I also enjoy a good adventure once in awhile. After all, life is meant to be an adventure.\"}, {\"index\": 174, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I stood on a slippery dock, rain pouring over my shivering body. Heart pounding, adrenaline pumping, I stepped to the edge and dove. I was jolted by the frigid, fifty-five degree water of a remote Norwegian fjord. I surfaced, breathing heavily in the cold. The shore behind me was awash with shades of deep evergreen and shimmering silver; ahead, the rainy fjord\\'s surface was alive with a million overlapping ripples, and majestic mountains rose steeply on the opposite shore. I\\'m sure a tourism pamphlet would have pictured this fjord on a brilliantly sunny day, but the rainy scene had a mysterious, remote beauty that no camera could possibly capture.Places like this center me. To me, nature represents simplicity, an escape from a lifestyle often dominated by constant connectedness, chronic busyness, and pressure to achieve. Doggy paddling in the fjord, I have nothing to worry about except the stinging feeling in my toes, the surreal vista around me, and the sounds of others splashing into the onyx water. When I duck back under the surface, I am not preoccupied with the college applications that await me at home. I am guided by wildness and pure instinct, drawn to the refreshing nordic water. I am lost in the present moment.This location is especially precious. It\\'s not only an escape to nature, but also to an eclectic yet tight community. Adjacent to the fjord sits a Luethi-Peterson campsite, a low-tech international summer organization grown out of the ashes of World War II. Last summer, our group of thirty spent a month sharing the responsibilities of communal living, exploring our local environment, and learning about the world through each other.Fjording- our made-up verb for using the fjord to bathe- is a characteristic example of Luethi-Peterson-style fun. At dinner announcements, a spontaneous chant\\\\u2014 \\'FJORDING! FJORDING!\\'\\\\u2014 spread infectiously, convincing even the vehemently anti-fjording Sardinian boy Aire that fjording in the rain would be more exciting than hot showers. And it was. Rain fjording was a special occasion, so after washing we decided to brave the cold and swim out deeper. For a hectic minute we treaded water in a circle, shouting at each other over the rain, catching raindrops on our tongues, and squealing in the cold. A fisherman boated by, and we yelled greetings at him in a language we created by repurposing words on labels of Norwegian kitchen items, much to his confusion. Goofiness and camaraderie pulsed through our group as we lingered in the icy water, forces that transcended language barriers. We recognized the value of co-created fun, which sometimes comes at the expense of comfort. The shock of the water was worth the wild joy of togetherness.I had a teacher who always said, \\'The juice is worth the squeeze.\\' I adopted the proverb, and try to live by it. The phrase encourages experimentation and embracing challenges. It\\'s ultimately the reason I found myself bounding towards the fjord that day, wellington boots splashing through a muddy path and rain soaking my bones\\\\u2014 even when an indoor shower was readily available.Fjording was never easy. Throwing myself under that frigid water demanded confidence and courage. It was a daily test of character\\\\u2014 undoubtedly a squeeze. But even on the days when fifty-five degree nordic water didn\\'t seem so appealing, I never lost sight of how much \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018juice\\' I gained from fjording. Indeed, the setting is incomparable natural beauty, its simple majesty keeps me grounded. It takes place with a diverse community, living with a shared purpose. It is also a leap of faith, a challenge. I sacrificed the commodity of comfort, and was rewarded generously. Fjording certainly isn\\'t a practical choice for getting clean, but it is cleansing in the truest sense. It confirms a principle that I carry with me as I anticipate college: the juice is worth the squeeze.\"}, {\"index\": 175, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I\\'ve always despised the cockroach. Their dark, armored bodies, small, ticklish legs, and long, tentacle-like antennae. It\\'s not that I hate all bugs; the ant is industrious and playful, the ladybug is sweet and thoughtful, the daddy longlegs is graceful and mysterious. But something is just different about the cockroach, something that makes my skin crawl.I remember crouching around my grandmother\\'s kitchen table playing Scrabble, deep in thought about how to manipulate my nearly impossible combination of letters to form a word, while maneuvering the board as to achieve optimal points scored. As I rotated the smooth, wooden \\'Q\\' in my hand, a scurrying along the floor dragged me out of my Scrabble hypnosis.My eyes darted towards the ground. There it was. The roach. Its fat, bloated body lurked closer and closer to my chair. As I leapt onto the table like an ape, the Scrabble tiles flew into the air, crashing onto the linoleum floor below like pellets of hail during an autumn storm. \\'Kill it, grandma!\\' I wailed, petrified. She pulled off her slipper, slamming it hard onto the cockroach\\'s scuffling body. My deepest fears subsided now that the roach was dead.Suddenly, from under the slipper, an antennae poked out, then another, as the resurrected roach squirmed free, alive. Its legs scampered as it dashed out of danger and vanished into a crack in the wall. My heart still pounded, though the cockroach was now gone. \\'Those suckers always seem to get away. Luckily,\\' grandma said, \\'cockroaches only live down south. You won\\'t have to worry about those up north.\\' I thought I had escaped the roaches. Little did I know.Six years later, I\\'m sitting next to Amy Robbins, Syracuse, New York\\'s premier early morning radio broadcaster, practically a celebrity in these parts. I place the headphones over my ears as the sound of the outside world fades away, and I\\'m transported into a different realm. The song dissipates. Sound bites are cut and merged together as the advertising jingle begins. And finally, Amy speaks. I smile like a fanboy as each crisp word rolls off her tongue.The day\\'s top stories, weather, a phone-in, and finally it\\'s my turn to speak. My hands tremble from the excitement of it all as I clench the paper tightly, the lines I am to recite scribbled illegibly across the page. Except, I\\'m frozen. Immobilized. Unable to speak. My heart beats faster and faster, and I try to force the words out, but it\\'s as if my brain is disconnected from my tongue. It\\'s not stage fright that\\'s awakening this panic, it\\'s something else. And I see it. Slowly, deliberately climbing up the cord of my headphones. The roach: it\\'s back.I\\'m living my dream, live on-air in front of thousands of listeners. It\\'s my chance to shine, my chance to speak. And I\\'m screwing it all up. The roach\\'s fat, bloated body inches closer and closer to my head as it clings to the cord.But too horrified to slap it away, I leave listeners with the longest awkward silence in the history of 93Q Radio.\\'Say your lines!\\' Amy scowled, unaware of the roach.I feel the greasy cockroach launch onto my scalp, where it stops its journey and nestles deep into my thick head of hair. This time, I\\'m not going to jump on the table. I woke up an hour early for this; I\\'m not going to let some uncrushable bug stand in the way of my dream.I take a gulp, breath in, and begin to speak. Broadcasting, live on air. I feel like a real journalist, even if for just a second. I smile as I deliver the words scrawled across the page, feeling the rhythm of each syllable released from my lips. Then, I realize: I am the cockroach. Pesky. Annoying, even. Yet resilient. Always able to overcome.\"}, {\"index\": 176, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The price of two fudge cupcakes and three peanut butter brownies is $14.56, plus my self-esteem. This August I realized that I was too old to have no job experience and applied to a local bakery for a position as a cashier. Nervous about the possibility of wearing a hairnet and being surrounded by chocolate that I could not eat, I was half-hoping that my application would be rejected. But as fate would have it, I received a call a week later from the bakery; they had decided to hire me.My nervousness turned into excitement. I would finally have my first job and make my own money! On my first day of training, I walked into the bakery ready to conquer anything. My confidence was bolstered by my introduction to the cash register.\\'All you have to do is type in how much money the customer gives? That\\'s really it?!\\' I happily asked the girl training me.\\'Yep! It\\'s that easy. Why don\\'t you ring up the next customer?\\' she said.The next customer was a mother with two teenage children. She ordered two fudge cupcakes and three peanut butter brownies. As she approached the cash register with her money in hand, I lost all my confidence and was suddenly having flashbacks to third grade when I struggled with understanding pretend money. Her total was $14.56, a price which will live in infamy, and she gave me a twenty dollar bill and a quarter. Having lost all activity in the part of my brain that knows how to count, I put in the amount of money she had given me as $20.15 and gave her back ten cents less than what she should have received.\\'I need ten cents,\\' the woman told me. \\'You owe me ten cents.\\'I still had yet to realize my simple mistake. I calmly looked back at the amount of change that the cash register displayed, but I was internally panicking. Ten cents? Where? How?\\'Ten cents. You owe me ten cents,\\' the woman repeated in a frustrated tone.I was able to understand stoichiometry and calculus that year in school, but I could not figure out why I owed this customer ten cents. I stared at the cash register again as the woman repeated \\'ten cents\\' in an angry tone. Suddenly I realized my greatest recourse: I could ask for help from the girl training me. I did so, and she resolved the issue with ease. Once I understood what I did wrong, I felt like a fool and hoped that I would never see the customer again, as she will forever know me as the person who looked at a quarter and thought, \\'ah, fifteen cents!\\' Hoping to never repeat my embarrassing failure, I dissected exactly what I did wrong later that day. I realized that panicking and worrying before a situation even arose was my first mistake and that waiting to ask for help was my second mistake.I would love to say that I have never made a mistake with a customer\\'s money since that day, but I have made a few more blunders. I no longer beat myself up about mistakes; instead, I stay calm and use all my resources, whether it\\'s a calculator or the help of another employee. Outside of the bakery, I use the same method when experiencing difficulty. If I do not understand a concept in school, I now always ask for help. If I am feeling upset about something, I reach out to friends and family. Whenever I inevitably fail at something, I do not panic or worry as long as I am certain that I tried my hardest to prevent the failure from occurring. These valuable lessons were instilled in me over the simple matter of ten cents.\"}, {\"index\": 177, \"new_personal_statement\": \"As a citizen , a country devastated by war but one that has recently gained its independence, I have witnessed both the destructive and liberating power of politics. This context has fostered in me an aspiration to advocate for peace and social justice. My experiences have highlighted the importance of identifying vulnerable political systems and the necessity to create strong political frameworks to prevent disastrous internal conflicts erupting. This aim, I believe can be achieved through the understanding of political philosophy and economics; therein lies my fascination with the subject and my ambition to pursue PPE at degree level. It was during my first history lesson on the Partition of Africa that I recognized the potency and relevance of politics in our contemporary world. This inspired me to study IB History, where we have explored the ideologies of authoritarian leaders: Mussolini, Hitler and Mao.Upon reading \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Why Nations Fail\\' by Daren Acemoglu, who postulates that politics is the template from which economic systems are derived, I drew parallels with the recent Brexit debate on whether a single market should be maintained or full independence from the EU should be pursued. This current argument has provoked a desire to learn more about the symbiotic relationship between politics and the economy and the significant role that state intervention can play. Furthering my interest in the role economics plays in societies I read Dambisa Moyo\\'s \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Dead Aid.\\' Her claim that the provision of aid to African nations should be questioned as it creates dependency, fosters corruption and results in persistent poverty was one I sympathised with. As an African I fervently believe that aid at a grassroots level is a far more effective method of encouraging economic development. Moyo\\'s book encouraged me to revisit my own African heritage. The environment in South Sudan I grew up in fostered an inclination towards radical ideologies and I recently explored the lives of revolutionaries such as Thomas Sankara and Kwame Nkurumah, both committed advocates of Pan Africanism. Their views immediately echoed my own and fed my desire to learn more about this challenging area of African history.In 2015, I was selected to attend the World Summit for Noble Peace Prize Laureates in Barcelona where I had the opportunity to converse with influential political figures such as Oscar Sanchez on the current refugee crisis. His insights were illuminating and prompted me to join the school MUN society. Here I have advanced my global perspective on politics and honed my debating skills by addressing issues such as Nuclear Security, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation. This activity has led me to appreciate the necessity of strong international law to maintain peace in the world. In addition to pushing the limits academically, I strive to succeed in extracurricular activities as well. I play basketball, taking on the role of team captain and have excelled in athletics. My motivation, passion and discipline has naturally led to leadership roles in the Student Council and to participating in the debating society. My proficiency in English, Arabic, Swahili and Italian has enabled me to engage with people with diverse ideas and enhancing my global perspective of the world.The rigor of studying economics will challenge me but also support me in acquiring the skills necessary to pursue a career in public service and to fulfill my ambition of playing an effective and positive role in the further development of my own fledgling African country.\"}, {\"index\": 178, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I sat by the door of the auditorium. A guy was on-stage, the subject escaped me. Big red letters on the screen read TEDx. I was calm. I had done this dozen of times and speaking before audiences was no big deal.His speech was over. I heard applause. I sat on the front row and waited while they set the stage, the projector, the microphone.I thought back to a year earlier on the Boston T-line. The train stopped. A girl sat beside me and we started talking. She told me of a program called DACA, through which she was managing the local Starbuck\\'s marketing. I figured programs like this helped maintain Uncle Sam\\'s entrepreneurial culture. According to Schumpeter\\'s definition, entrepreneurship is directly bound to a country\\'s development. I had to bring this to Brazil.The MC cleared his throat. \\'...so now I call to the stage our entrepreneur of the evening, Felipe Meneses!\\' Applause. When I got to the microphone, the bright light of the projector blinded me and I forgot my lines.Five seconds. Maybe six. What was my theme? Three more seconds\\\\u2026 eternity... A little anguish. Little by little my memory trickled back. Breathe in, breathe out. I should have been proud. At the time, LIGA was operating in three states in Brazil, developing its own materials on entrepreneurial education, and had just partnered with the biggest basic education company in the country.I stared at my shoes, coughed. I founded this nonprofit due to my will to make a positive change in society. LIGA is focused on instigating an entrepreneurial culture in Brazil and empowering the youth to make the change they want to see in the world. At first, we promoted talks by relevant businessmen and local leaderships. Then came the events featuring entrepreneurial dynamics such as the Marshmallow Challenge. LIGA is now 6 months old, inspiring hundreds of teenagers to action, from the creation of a happier environment to a business.Through LIGA, I discovered that many people had a passion and just didn\\'t trust their potential. There is hope, though, because when they perceived it was possible, they were eager to learn. Furthermore, in the right environment, everything happens much faster. After engaging in our events, some participants started NGOs and businesses. We ended up conceiving a course called Metamorphosis to help them develop and improve their institutions!That is why I was onstage. All you need is a spark in the eye. I had to share it with the audience. LIGA started as a Minimum Viable Project in my school with about 40 participants - not an ambitious initiative at first. If we could change two people, it would be extraordinary. If each of them did the same for two more and this cycle was repeated 33 times with different individuals, we would have changed the Earth. To my surprise, the project has grown exponentially. Perhaps we are underway.In search of new materials, I went to the Brazilian Leadership Bootcamp, where I met some of the best young social entrepreneurs in Brazil. I shared with them our vision and all the change that has been reported in people\\'s lives. Some of them have since partnered with me and, together, we are striving to expand LIGA throughout the country. The objective now is to disseminate our message throughout the 26 Brazilian states and establish a network of young entrepreneurs determined to forge a positive impact in society, hence taking the country to a better future.I breathed in, I breathed out, smiled and told my story.Black holes are among the most intricate and baffling objects in outer space. Some are powerful enough to gather whole galaxies around them. They sit there, parsimonious, not understood, alone. Yet, when two black holes encounter, they come closer and closer orbiting each other until they merge, creating a breathtaking spectacle. A black hole is formed when a star\\'s gravitational pull overcomes its inner forces, making it collapse into itself. Passionate people are just like black holes. Most of them are misinterpreted at first. Yet, they change their surroundings and inspire others. Given the opportunity to work with people who share their passion, they perform wonderful feats. Of course, black holes are scattered through the universe and there are still many stars able to turn into these beautiful objects. In earthling terms, picture a place that could catalyze change. Imagine the power it might gather. With that vision, I created LIGA, a non-profit with the purpose of promoting an entrepreneurial culture in Brazil and empowering the youth to make the change they want to see in the world. After a little over 6 months, LIGA is operating in three states, inspiring hundreds of teenagers. They approach everything from the creation of a happier community to a business plan. Through LIGA I discovered that many people have a passion and just don\\'t see themselves able to make it come true. They\\'re like stars. When they perceive it is possible, they get eager to learn. There is hope. Also, I found out that everything you need is a spark in the eye. LIGA started as an MVP in my school with about 40 participants. Later, in the Brazilian Leadership Bootcamp, I met some of the most amazing people \\\\u2013 supermassive black holes. I didn\\'t feel alone there, I felt excited, for we understood each other in so many ways. I told them LIGA\\'s vision and all the change that has been reported in people\\'s lives. Some of these bootcamp fellows felt inspired and joined LIGA as well. And black holes started orbiting each other. After two weeks, we were partnering with one of the major educational institutions in the country, expanded to two more states and had a bunch of new ideas. As a black hole merger, we are willing to send ripples throughout space.I hold the basket upon my head as he hands me fruits the size of golf balls. The face worn off by life, he still takes pleasure in time spent with me, the orchard, the sweet smell all around us. Summer has just begun. Mangaba season. Nonexistent anywhere else in the world, mangabas are a symbol of my hometown, my home state. Spherical, chartreuse in color, infused by a strong carmine whose dispersion on yellow seems like the distribution of heat on the cosmic microwave background. Aracaju is where I live, capital of Sergipe, in Brazil. Tupi for little macaw or cashew, it should have been named after mangaba. Now we share the handles of the basket, grandpa and I. He tells me of nothing really, yet it all so meaningful. In the farm kitchen, grandma joins us around the spoils of our battle. And she makes mangaba juice, jam, preserve while she shares stories of her own childhood.As I sip the whitish juice, I can feel the unique fusion of the sweet and sour in my mouth forming something magical, I can feel the connection to my heritage, my home. But as Hamlet put it, \\'I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself the king of infinite space\\\\u2026\\'. Well, I was bounded in my mangaba tree, but there was a bigger world to explore.My parents were always proactive in face of my five-year-old questions. But when such doubts became more complex, answers became scarce. The more I studied, the more doubts arose. Inquired, adults now told me not to worry because they would be answered in high school. High school, the promised land, was described as perfect for someone yearning for knowledge. However, when I got there, I was told that my questions would be addressed later, in college. Honestly, it seemed like nobody cared. But I could not wait any longer. So I did what my teachers told me.I went to college. I became part of Future Mathematician Project, a respected center for math prodigies in Brazil. There, I was taught fundamental structures such as Linear Algebra and Real Analysis. I grasped the theories of Weierstrass and Riemman and was dazzled by the writings of great professors such as Kenneth Hoffman and Richard Courant, but most importantly, I wasn\\'t alone. In my vigorous pursuit of knowledge, I was accompanied by likewise curious people. We\\'d spend hours debating the intricacies of mathematical theories. That setting was embedded in knowledge, and so was I. It was a moment of sudden epiphany. From that chair where I sat, 18-year-old PhDs were born and so were people whose capacity of understanding I could not dream to bear. Inspiration came from everywhere. After so many years, I had answers, and from those answers, many more questions arose. In that environment, I truly felt intellectually alive. A free mind to explore the universe, cracking the nutshell.\"}, {\"index\": 179, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Stepping off the plane on June 13, 2005, I knew I was no longer in Colombia.

I walked into a room ofacademic abundance. The walls were lined with classic motivational posters, every letter of the alphabet, and whatI believed to be the most important thing of all: the multiplication table. I began that day at the bottom of my class, Iwas the kid who talked the least because he knew the least, yet many years later, I ended up transitioning intohigh school at the top one percent of my class, a testament to the great choice my parents had made severalyears prior.

Leadership is not bossing people around, rather it\\'s working alongside them to accomplish a common goal. In my life, I have been privileged to be able to lead different groups of people to receive awards and complete our goals. However, one experience that has positively influenced others on a completely different level than the rest, is my leadership in our school\\'s Advanced Placement (AP) Ambassadors program. Our AP Ambassadors program is a group of students whom have taken AP classes and are readily available to tutor students who need aid in their AP or honors classes. I vividly remember the day an Algebra II student walked into our advisor\\'s room, after being forced by his mom to participate in tutoring. Our advisor asked who was available, and in the abounding sea of people, I raised my hand and offered to help. I raised my hand, even though I was flooded with piles of work from my other extracurriculars, journalism, and yearbook, because I saw, what I believed was, a spark in this student, who even though had been dragged to this study session was ready to learn and improve. We worked diligently after school for a couple of days until the day before his test. I tutored him by going step by step until he dominated algebra. I could have easily decided to let someone else tutor him or have just told him to do this and that, but I genuinely believe working alongside someone and getting down to their level and helping them from the ground up is the best way to lead someone. Leading should be done by example, doing the hard work and taking the time out your day to just concentrate on teaching, rather than telling other people to do it. This student, after putting in the work with me, was able to ace his last test. Not only did this bring satisfaction to him, but I was ecstatic that I was able to contribute to his success.Stepping off the plane in 2005, I knew I was no longer in Colombia.

Everything I endured prepared me for excellence in my future endeavors.As a senior and student, it is our duty to leave our school better than when we first entered as a freshman. As my junior year concluded, I was faced with a tough selection of classes and choosing whether to pursue journalism, yearbook, or both. These two classes intrigued me, I had been part of yearbook back in middle school and journalism my junior year. I was attracted to our school\\'s publishing classes, in part because of my love for photojournalism, but mostly because it was my way of giving back and leaving a mark on my school. Our school\\'s yearbook department was mediocre while our newspaper was nationally ranked and I believed I could transform our yearbook department into a pacemaker winning school while enhancing our journalism department as well. Even though our two departments share the common goal of recording our school\\'s history, they were divided and worked within their own hub. I took it upon myself to try to aid with the building of a bridge between the two departments. However, the way I approached this could be seen as ambitious. I applied for editor-in-chief of both publications, and to my surprise, I became the head of these two great departments. When senior year started I had been able to flow information, articles, and photographs from one publication to the other and vice versa, and this new friendship has enhanced both publications. A problem both classes had, was the lack of coverage of school events. Now that we share information, we are able to get greater coverage of events because if one publication is at an event, it\\'s as if both journalism and yearbook were there. This merger of agenda has aided our school because now the student body is able to stay updated with current school events via our newspaper and once the school year is over they will be able to reflect on all the events captured by both publications. While this merger was probably inevitable, I am ecstatic that I was a part of constructing a great yearbook while enhancing our nationally ranked newspaper.An idea that I believe in, is my intellectual development and this idea of staying hungry, hungry for knowledge and understanding. This idea sets me apart as a student because my motivation is fueled by my academic hunger to learn more and understand the curriculum which I am taught.I feed via indulging in knowledge; this method includes self-teaching through the internet or videos, learning from other knowledgeable people, or simply letting my curiosity run free and allowing it to learn from experience. I don\\'t believe people have a limit in their understanding of a subject, I believe we\\'re all capable of expanding our knowledge and developing our mind beyond our believed capacity. As for myself, I know I love learning new insights because learning is my brain\\'s food. Staying hungry is not a problem when it comes to feeding my brain, it is the method through which I have experienced some of my greatest satisfaction. When I was able to comprehend derivatives because I taught myself after school, I was ecstatic that I understood a complex idea that my peers didn\\'t understand at first. I was able to aid them because I had nourished my hungry brain weeks prior to the actual lesson. Staying hungry fueled my intellectual development because it kept me wanting to learn new information every day. This hunger sets me apart from a wide variety of students because most students\\' hunger is hidden and never surfaces. Some prefer to take the easy road and do what is minimally required, yet I know my hunger and vigor to succeed sets me apart. It\\'s what allowed me to become editor-in-chief of two publications and what has allowed me to achieve great success in my rigorous academic courses. I know that other students pursue education and hold it to a high regard, yet I believe that there is only a handful of students who truly hunger and appreciate the opportunity to learn, and being able to study at a University of California would allow me to pamper my hunger to a higher degree than I ever thought possible.\"}, {\"index\": 180, \"new_personal_statement\": \"On September 20, 2014, a friend told me a secret that had haunted her since she was in the seventh grade. We first met in physics class earlier that month, and developed an immediate connection. As we spent more time together, we became close friends much faster than I had anticipated. I can still vividly remember the moment when she pulled over her car and turned to me unleashing out of nowhere, \\'Winnie, I have an eating disorder.\\'Hearing those words, I immediately froze. My entire body locked up; I had never been this speechless in my life before. She looked worried, and I felt my heart racing as I searched desperately for even a single word in reply. The simple \\'Oh\\\\u2026\\' I responded was far from eloquent.My uncomfortable response accurately demonstrates how I acted for the entire first week after our conversation. As I struggled to find words to comfort her, I worried that she might think I didn\\'t want to be her friend anymore, but that was in no way the case. I was surprised at how she was able to expose this painful illness to me, since we were friends for a few short weeks. By sharing, she showed that she had complete trust in me, and that level of trust was unexpected for such a nascent friendship.Nobody had ever opened up to me about a problem that carried the same weight as my friend\\'s eating disorder. I had no experience dealing with this kind of issue, but I truly believed it was my moral obligation to conquer my uneasiness and step up to the challenge of helping her recover.I was crushed knowing that she sensed my hesitation. I decided it was time to overcome my fear that was slowly eroding our friendship by assuring her, \\'We are going to get you through this together, and I am here to support you whenever you need.\\' These were basic words of encouragement I should have said from the very beginning. Hearing myself say those words, I felt a new sense of responsibility resting on my shoulders and recognized that I had the capacity to make a true difference in her life. I held the power to help her change and gain back control over her life.At my insistence, she agreed to check herself into a residential program at an eating recovery center nearby, and I made time to visit her on weeknights even when I was busy with sports and homework. She was never light on saying \\'thank you\\', even for the smallest of acts. She always appreciated me, but she struggled with appreciating herself.As I became fully invested in supporting her, I realized that she cherished my devotion and that I was becoming a force of influence on her. She listened to me, respected me, and looked up to me. The process toward recovery has been long -- she relapsed three times and had to leave college after being there for only three weeks. When she arrived home from an extremely intensive recovery center in Colorado earlier this year, I finally saw a mental change, which was as welcomed as her return to a healthy weight. She eventually began to accept herself for who she is and regained trust in her choices.My role in my friend\\'s recovery has fundamentally changed my perspective on how to live my life. It forced me to grow up quickly, as it showed me how fragile life can be. I now appreciate more deeply the impact of my actions; with newfound purpose, I am more deliberate in my daily efforts. I also see more clearly the positive effect of these resolute actions on the many responsibilities I have and will face. My experience taught me how to communicate my compassion for others, and committed me to using that skill to effectively impact their lives.\"}, {\"index\": 181, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I still remember Accepted Students\\' Day in April 2017 at Wake Forest: the North Carolinian weather was beautiful,the students were approachable, and university officials touted achievements such as the university\\'s ranking inthe top ten schools in the country for undergraduate teaching quality, and having an average class size of just 21students.

I don\\'t have any friends!\\' cried one of my second-grade science class students. I was about to give the empty consolation of \\'I\\'m sure somebody likes you,\\' but then I remembered how I felt when I was his age. And I remembered what happened at Bird Camp.The previous summer, when I was sixteen, I had spent a week learning the basics of birding alongside a handful of young, knowledgeable, and arrogant birders, and I had every expectation of fitting in with that group of people who shared my unusual trait: an obsession with birds. But I was quickly singled out for having spent the previous year working in a bird store that specialized in parrots. \\'If we see see any parakeets in the trees, be sure to identify them for us,\\' mocked George, the program coordinator. I didn\\'t know the key to this social circle was recognizing the call of a chipping sparrow, or gossiping about which outlandish eBird reports were sure to be rejected. I wondered if I should quit, go home to my pet cockatiels, and quit trying to be a Wild Bird Person altogether.But I didn\\'t. The next morning I woke up at five o\\'clock to search for prothonotary warblers in a swamp on the outskirts of a farm, wearing a sunhat that everyone said made me look like I was about to go on a safari\\\\u2014 I just wanted to avoid a sunburn. I soon discovered the depths of encyclopedic knowledge the other birders had of forest dwelling species, and made the blunder of trying to compare my story of the time Dickens the cockatoo ate a moth to their tales of finding whip-poor-wills late at night. It soon became clear that I was not a part of the flock.On the third day, when my inexperience no longer weighed me down, I got lost in a cornfield while on a quest for wood ducks. It was the perfect time to think about how in the past three days, my socks had been soaked through with mud, I was heavily perfumed with a mix of sweat and bug spray, I got hives twice from a beagle named Crazy Bailey, and I saw a baby vulture in the second floor of an abandoned barn nicknamed the Haint House. Just because I hadn\\'t immediately made a bunch of friends didn\\'t mean I wasn\\'t having a memorable adventure. Still, it stung that when I finally returned to the group, I was greeted with an indifferent \\'Hi Mady.\\' Nobody realized I had been gone.One fateful moment at Bird Camp came on the night we spent on a stretch of country road listening for owls. We pulled up in the bus riddled with fly carcasses from the swamp and tumbled out as quietly as we could. As I crept along the gravel, I spotted a trash bag turned loose in the grass, and I scanned the trees until I saw the telltale beady eyes staring back at me. \\'I found a screech owl!\\' My peers applauded my discovery: I had finally proven myself to them. Raising my binoculars, I looked closer and realized it was just a baby raccoon. I let out the breath I didn\\'t know I was holding, allowing my heart to sink briefly before continuing on. That week, although I never had the chance to prove myself to others, I was able to shake off the dirt and keep going, and I had proven to myself that I was strong.\\'You know what, William?\\' I responded, my mind back in science club. \\'It\\'s alright if not everyone likes you. You\\'ll be much happier if you don\\'t sacrifice doing what you love for the sake of fitting in. The right friends will love you for who you are, even if they\\'re feathered and chirpy.\\' His tears dried, and we returned to class.\"}, {\"index\": 183, \"new_personal_statement\": \"As a little girl, I was terrified of practically everything. And I mean this in the most literal sense. Around every corner was a different monster: nightmares, ghosts, even the tooth fairy lying in wait to steal my teeth. Despite all this, my parents called me their \\'little star\\', an embodiment of their beliefs that I was capable of anything. I thought they were crazy.With time, new fears replaced old ones. Fear of the unknown, of the spotlight, of pain \\\\u2013 I had it all. My fears bothered me, but too afraid to confront them head-on, it was simply easier to fade into the background of a cheering crowd during Homecoming, or skip a blood drive to avoid the aching prick of a needle. Trying out for my school\\'s cheerleading team was no exception. But giving into my friends\\' incessant pleas to join the team, I was made a flyer, the supposed daredevil who - quite literally - dangled over the depths of despair. With the build of a fragile bird, I worried about 1) falling and 2) breaking. And considering the utter klutz I was, it truly was the perfect set-up for catastrophe. Indeed, the first time my team attempted twist baskets, I flailed through the air, slipping through their grasps and receiving a concussion. It should\\'ve been my breaking point. Like a sadistic \\'exit\\' sign, it was practically a sentencing that I was meant to live my life barred behind the alarms of chaos and doubt. But ironically, my concussion was a wake-up call. Despite fretting over my injury, I couldn\\'t shake the ephemeral bliss I had experienced before my fall. It had been my first grasp of freedom from fear, and now, I was tired of feeling cornered by my monsters. And what wasn\\'t to say that if I stopped stunting altogether, I wouldn\\'t get another concussion regardless? For all I knew, cheerleading had been a catalyst, and without it, I would have never discovered my exhilaration for flying. If I could win my battles against other fears, I wondered what other passions I would discover.From this awakening stemmed a tenacious determination to finally embrace the fears holding me back. Forcing myself to conquer every activity I had been afraid of, I donated blood, which, in retrospect, wasn\\'t even all that painful. I dragged myself to my class\\'s ballroom audition, and surprisingly, had fun. Although accompanied by many falls, I discovered my untapped potential for performing. Flash forward to the Homecoming rally of my junior year as I twirled centerstage with my partner to the beat of a deafening applause; I savored every moment. The opportunities that opened up simply by being proactive were astounding; I was finally free from fear.As for cheerleading, through weeks of nonstop drilling and the support of my teammates, I eventually rebuilt the courage to try another twist-basket. Perfectly executing the stunt, tears of joy brimmed over my eyes as I realized that my tenacity had paid off. Yearning for strength over fear, my perseverance had screamed and clawed its way out to tell me I was strong. My fear of flying still remains, but is prevailed by the sense of determination I have in myself to rise. Even stars cannot shine without the darkness. That is to say, I don\\'t regret my fears. My fears are what has shaped me into the strong individual I am today: someone who isn\\'t afraid to explore and learn new things, isn\\'t afraid to live in the moment, and is determined to persevere. Too long have I spent wallowing in regret and lost opportunities. The dreams I have for myself range from the more feasible, such as developing my own line of wearable technology, to the improbable, like becoming the next Walt Disney, and fears in tow or not, I intend to conquer them all. I guess I\\'m a little star after all.On the day of my graph transformations test, I could vividly hear my heartbeat following a strict, piercing rhythm. It sped up as I turned in my test, and again when the sheet came back filled with red corrections. I collapsed into my bed that night, turning to the only solace I had in these moments of disheartenment: a Disney movie marathon. Coaxed by the darkness, my eyes slowly began to droop, eventually concentrating solely on the blurry outlines of characters I could make out on-screen. Suddenly, a glimmer of inspiration! Dumbed down, a character\\'s appearance was just an outline comprised of shapes and lines. Couldn\\'t this be recreated through manipulated equations as well? Channeling my love for Disney, I decided to reteach myself transformations by recreating characters on Desmos, a graphing calculator application. My first objective was to construct Mickey\\'s iconic ears. I inputted the standard equation for two circles, applying vertical and horizontal shifts to move both centers from the origin. Continuing with his forehead, I grasped that Mickey\\'s ears weren\\'t perfect circles, but rather, arcs. I restricted both circles\\' domains, and almost miraculously, the three equations intertwined to form the base of Mickey\\'s head! Though it took hundreds of trial and error runs to finish the rest of his figure, I finally felt a sense of accomplishment as I completed the goal of catching up to my peers. But the creator within me strove to become more ambitious. Over the course of several more drawings, I overloaded my browser history with tutorials on inequalities to integrate shading, and my admiration for Pixar animations pushed me to incorporate their usages of cycloids and epicycloids. With the ability to move on the graph, my characters had finally come alive! That old piercing rhythm in my heart has since been replaced by an ocean calm as I no longer fear math. What once seemed like a terrifying subject is now an open-ended voyage into a new dimension of creativity that I\\'d never considered before- one filled with possibilities and a new adventure into the unknown that I intend to conquer.Joining my school\\'s cheerleading team was a decision made with apprehension. With the build of a fragile bird, I feared 1) falling and 2) breaking. Yet the first time I tried a stunt, I felt secure. I trusted my teammates.This trust was soon shattered during our first attempts at twist baskets. I flailed through the air, receiving a concussion that prevented me from stunting for a month. In time, I noticed that due to my fall, a lack of faith had spread and implanted a weaker mentality within both my teammates and myself. I was determined to restore the team dynamic, but to do so, I also needed to rebuild the faith I had once had in myself. The first step was to take an initiative on communication. I made a newfound effort to voice my inner thoughts and pushed others to do the same. Once I expressed my concern that we lacked synchronization, Daisy, another teammate, spoke up during the next practice about feeling as if our team lacked the fundamentals. Vulnerability became a strength that refortified trust. With a clearer picture of what I had to improve, I devised a second strategy to build a stronger foundation with new workouts geared towards targeting specific muscles for each member. As our bodies grew stronger, so did our bond.After weeks of intense drilling, we retried another twist-basket. But this time, I embraced the possibility of falling with the faith that I would land in a safe cluster of arms. Perfectly executing the stunt, we rejoiced with all the happiness in the world shining through us. Tears of joy brimmed over my eyes as I realized that my team had come together as one. Succeeding in cementing my team\\'s mentality of faith over doubt, my perseverance had simultaneously screamed and clawed its way out to reveal the greatest talent I possess to this day: establishing trust. My fears of stunting still remain, but is prevailed by the sense of faith I feel tethering me to the team holding me up and the determination I have in myself to rise.Captivated by the creative freedom of art and design, growing up, I never associated math and science with anything other than restrictions or theoretics. Hindered by this fixed-mindset in STEM classes, I constantly found myself questioning the purpose behind lessons and unsolved problem sets. I consequently sought opportunities to broaden my perspective, and one day I submitted an application to a professor for a spot in his human-computer-interaction internship. Under his tutelage, I was assigned a project to develop a theoretical line of wearable technology. Envisioning SMART jewelry covered in sparkling lights galore, I brainstormed sketches, experimenting with variables like colors and durability. But unsure of what surface textures to implement, I turned to two-proportion z-tests, a data-analysis test I had come across in statistics. Interviewing fifty locals, I uncovered sufficient evidence to conclude that metallic finishes were preferred over matte. Shocked that the jumble of laws I had force-fed my brain were applicable to design, I felt as if I had made a new discovery. It was wondrous. The magic didn\\'t stop at analytics. Soldering wires and stitching conductive threads to build LED bracelet prototypes, I was pleasantly surprised to discover my niche for engineering, an inventive craft that showcased the circuitries underlying my designs\\' functionalities. Learning code to program my wearables\\' apps, my right and left brain tendencies combined to unearth the unexpectedly dynamic world of computer science. As beautiful as it was intriguing, the ones and zeros at my fingertips became more than mere lines of code, but rather, flowing brush strokes on a painting that never dried. No longer limited to a sketchpad, technology had become my artistic outlet. My dreams as an artist are already in the works. Each stroke of paint, line of code, and discovery has summed up experiences that I can only communicate through creation. As for my studies, such applications in tangible creative applications have only validated my unshakable passion for constant learning and innovation. With statistics and computer science as my chosen mediums for design, I continue on my ongoing quest to bridge the divide between the arts and sciences.A time-traveler is a pretty fancy title for someone who gets to bring past experiences to life, but hey, I\\'ll take it. As someone who sees my city\\'s history museum as a piggy bank of memories, I\\'ve dedicated years of volunteering with the objective of helping others preserve time and beauty. Devastated by her grandfather\\'s diagnosis of Alzheimer\\'s, a local woman in her quest to preserve his childhood before his own memory loss could erase it had stumbled upon the museum\\'s services. She had searched through every nook and cranny of his basement for his photos, even contacted relatives to no avail. This was her last hope. As the one to answer her cry for help, I scoured through countless databases, working overtime until I finally came into contact with his pictures in a yearbook at a nearby library. Now, imagine my astonishment as I handed the memento to see genuine tears of joy rolling down the woman\\'s face! A world of emotions lit her face as she leafed through the pages, chuckling at the sight of his hideous haircuts, sobbing over his senior quote. She had discovered a whole new side of her grandfather, and I had helped her do it.Inspired by her gratitude, I embarked on my own quest to organize yearbook drives. Contacting libraries and schools, I focused my pitch on the collection\\'s sentimental benefits for the community, and by the end, I assembled over ninety yearbooks. A smile still beams on my face whenever an old-timer sees their yearbook photos - a wormhole into reliving their vivid past.Over time, I couldn\\'t help but notice that the museum\\'s suggestions boxes were cluttered with notes consisting of visitors\\' desires for more ways to remember their museum experiences. Learning from my yearbook drive that mementos could serve to rekindle memories, I became the founder and manager of the museum\\'s gift shop, introducing souvenirs like books, apparel, and pins.With these small acts, I\\'d like to think I\\'ve helped to preserve some of my own community\\'s magic and given others the power to time-travel as well. \"}, {\"index\": 184, \"new_personal_statement\": \"     Two whistles sliced through the tumult and the band lurched forward. Cymbals, drums, tubas, and the buoyant pop of confetti cannons reverberated through the humid Texan evening as all 216 members of our Troy High marching band thundered through San Antonio for the Fiesta Flambeau, America\\'s Largest Illuminated Parade. The LED lights we had threaded down our pant legs and across chest straps set our uniforms ablaze against a dusky purple sky. Advancing in unison, I remembered why I joined marching band: to belt out halftime tunes on bus rides, to breathe in the frigid Autumn air during Friday night home games,to feel every marching step resound through my bones.    I had yearned for this sense of community when my mom left my nuclear family halfway through ninth grade\\\\u2014she had accepted a promotion that required returning to China, the country she had grown up in before emigrating to the United States as an adult twenty years ago. When she left for China, life at home felt empty without her constant reminders to stand up straight, finish everything on my plate, and pack another lunch, just in case. I felt torn at her decision to return, not knowing what to feel or say as she packed up her old life, her travel brochures, clothes, and favorite pieces of porcelain scattered across the living room floor.    As our band wove through a figure-eight routine at the corner of Broadway and Commerce, I found myself wrapped in memories of the past and cut my figure-eight too sharply, colliding with a bandmate. Our LED cords ensnared us in a thorny embrace as the lightbulbs and safety pins on our uniforms melded into a clotted nebula of light flashing on and off at our elbows. The more we tried to pull away, the more we seemed tied together, so I panicked and yanked our battery packs from our overalls. As our uniforms suddenly shut off, I felt overwhelmed by the pulse of frenzied rhythms, the crowd\\'s rumbling and swelling behind traffic barriers, and, most of all, the painful flashes of what my life could have been if my mom had stayed.    Fumbling with the clump of cords in the dark, I took a deep breath and let my fingers slip over the knot, slowly unraveling its intricate web. The lights suddenly flickered on, dim at first, then blinding white as we became untangled, the last resoundingnote of our parade tune soaring over the crowd\\'s roar. When my bandmate and I finally returned to our place in line, a wave of relief washed over me. The smoky evening air expanded in my chest, my hands stopped trembling, and the turmoil of moments ago turned into an inner stillness. Thentwo whistles called me back to attentionand the band staggered forward for another song.    When we returned home from San Antonio, I tried deciphering why the tangled lights affected me so strongly, but in addition to describing the parade and our light-up uniforms, I found myself writing about my mom\\'s decision to return to China. I thought about the pictures she had sent of her hang-gliding in Hong Kong\\\\u2014her smile wide and framed by flyaway strands of hair\\\\u2014and I realized she had left both to secure my future and to enjoy her own. In the following year, writing became a major part of my life as I began paying closer attention to my understanding of the world, untangling the knots of confusion I felt at my mom\\'s decision to return to her homeland and my own identity as a second-generation Chinese immigrant. Writing guided me to a new understanding of my mom, myself, and the ways in which I am inextricably entwined with those who have impacted me\\\\u2014I do not march, write, learn, or do anything alone. I am always indebted to family and community, our lights and lives tangled together.\"}, {\"index\": 185, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Chubby fingers outstretched and round cheeks flattened against the window, I leaned further into the plexiglass. Although I could feel a firm hand tugging at my shirt, urging me to sit back in my seat - at ten, I possessed little concept of manners (or sanitary awareness), both of which I abandoned as I refused to cease standing on the chair of the CTA train - at the moment, all that mattered was that I was soaring above the streets of Chicago. Eyes darting across the ever changing expanses of the city, I refused to lift my gaze in fear of missing anything.For the first time, I was taking a trip in the belly of a gargantuan silver beast, known familiarly to most Chicagoans as the \\'L.\\'What distinguishes the L from its relatives - the Tube, le M\\\\u00e9tro, the MTA - is its ability to burst through concrete and asphalt streets to rise above, guided only by wood and steel, and glide through the towering skyscrapers that dot the Chicago skyline. It elevates and cultivates a sense of infinite wonder in its riders, from the all-too-serious businessmen I\\'ve caught gazing dreamily out the windows to the young children futilely yet passionately attempting to balance in the center of the car as the train weaves throughout the city. From that first ride to the present day, my fascination with the inner and outer workings of the L and its passengers has refined itself to an infatuation.Each ride presents a chance to ponder the overlooked, to question the seemingly mundane: You can quantify the number of people that find themselves teeming through the L\\'s sliding doors, but can you quantify their experiences? Who is that woman, man, student, small rodent, and what is their story? I adopt the lenses of journalists, economists, marketers, sociologists, historians, and the mere fellow passenger to analyze: the placement of an ad for Planet Fitness adjacent to an ad for Pizza Hut, the change in the racial makeup of passengers as the train travels North to South, the origin of unassuming stains or abandoned books. More recently I pondered, if they say the beat of a butterfly\\'s wings can induce a hurricane halfway across the world, can a five minute train delay get me into college?The L is a catalyst between my vim mind and the seemingly elusive outer world, a seventy-five cent silver chariot that I can ride to whatever adventure I see fit. Since that first ride, I persist in search of the optimal collection of train stops, forging a mental map of Chicago shaped by my life experiences - all accessible by a simple swipe of a ventra card. The multitude of train lines that branch from the L\\'s \\'Loop\\' are dotted with my discoveries. The boathouse, where I strain my vocal chords from hours of training (and hours of laughing with my teammates). The school, where I test the waters of political responsibility, explore the depths of socioeconomic research, and conquer the wakes of edits delivered on my reporting for the newspaper. The small urban farm, located in a former project, that I help create and cultivate each spring and summer.My thirst and and hunger for the knowledge of anything and everything was, and remains, insatiable. This train, this beating artery, pumping from the birthplace of the city to its outer reaches, is what quenches my thirst and satiates my hunger. Riding the L not only gave me the access to pursue rowing, a liberal education, and volunteerism; it forged a sense of adventurousness deep into the synapses of my nerves, a sense driving me into the intersections of journalism, student government, fashion, and aiding my beautiful city. That first L ride instilled the interests that lie within me, passions that subsist on experiencing life at its fullest and engaging my sponge-like intellectuality. I thrive on discovery. It defines who I am.\"}, {\"index\": 186, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Visits with my grandmother have always been awkward. I speak to her in mildly incoherent Mandarin as she pats my hand and smiles. It never bothered me much\\\\u2014that is, until my sixteenth birthday.My entire family had come to celebrate at a local restaurant, including my distant cousin, with whom we had only spoken to through brief phone calls. Despite the initial strangeness of her presence, she naturally fell into conversation with my grandmother; it soon erupted with my grandmother\\'s warm laughter\\\\u2014 genuine and unrestrained.When the meal finished, my grandmother approached me, pressing a cold hundred-dollar bill in my hand.

Ostensibly representative of our relationship, I couldn\\'t help but wonder if our love was merely obligatory\\\\u2014a familial expectation.Months after, a family friend invited me to go to Taiwan to teach rural students English. I gladly accepted; teaching was something I loved, and I (idealistically) interpreted this as a chance to improve both my Mandarin and relationship with my grandmother.However, it was only once I arrived that I realized the enormity of my responsibilities. Not only did I have to maintain my own room and board, but I had to cook my students\\' meals as well. My thirty pupils were also of varying ages and levels; some knew nouns, while others only fragments of the alphabet. Progress was sometimes so slow that I had to revise weeks of lesson plans. Moreover, they stigmatized English, and our lack of connection only furthered their minimal and apathetic participation.As discouraging as this was, I was even more disappointed by my own inability to communicate. The language barrier was unyielding, creating a rift between me and my surroundings. In class, I was unable to congratulate (or reprimand) students. During lectures, I stumbled over words. These incidents often triggered a red flush\\\\u2014painful reminders of what transpired on my birthday.Not trusting myself to speak decisively, I furthered my isolation. I was used to English as the world\\'s lingua franca, and having it as anything but that terrified me. My feelings were only amplified by the exhaustion of ceaseless teaching, cooking, and cleaning. At night I often cried, sometimes out of pure loneliness, other times from sheer frustration in my own inabilities.One day after a particularly grueling lesson, a student with whom I had previous difficulties with shuffled towards me. Upon seeing him, I braced myself for complaints, but instead was greeted with a request for the English translation of \\'uncle.\\' I answered him, surprised by his vulnerability. His interest spread quickly\\\\u2014students soon approached me shouting new vocabulary like \\'carrot!\\' or seeking nightly tutoring. One student even grabbed my hand and led me to a temple that overlooked the entire mountainside. Though sweaty and sun-beaten at the summit, I couldn\\'t help but gaze, awestruck by the winding dirt roads and sprawled cabbage fields below. There was an inherent beauty to it all, something satisfying in its simple, albeit wordless, existence.Though this experience improved my Mandarin only marginally, I connected with these children through a dynamic foreign back home. Putting their needs ahead of mine became second nature; every morning, I served them the congee I\\'d just made, and every night I walked them home, often getting hugged good night. Our reciprocity of love and respect had been built by few words\\\\u2014rather, actions. This experience catalyzed the growth of my self-confidence and consequently, my relationship with my grandmother. We now make mochi, her rough, cracked hands guiding mine. She shows me how to grind sesame seeds for the filling, how to stretch and knead the dough. Now, I am beginning to see delightful new things about her, from her crooked smiles to her playful eyes. Despite the time we\\'ve lost, I\\'m grateful and better understand that what we have\\\\u2014what we\\'ve always had, verbal or not\\\\u2014 is enough.For the past four years I have been an aerialist- climbing up silks and performing tricks, much like the acrobats in Cirque du Soleil. Despite the various bruises, burns, and blisters I receive, I love the art. It is something tangible- a welcome break from pixelated screens- where I can shake off the general lethargy of the day. When thirty feet up in the air, I am aware of every minutia of my body, from my strained biceps to the strip of silk balanced on my back, maintaining my suspension. My callused hands, sticky with rosin, deftly weave in and out of the fabric, knotting my arms and legs to prepare for every trick. Contrary to traditional art, here, I am both the creator and the created. My body is the centerpiece, telling stories with every performance. While large tricks like drops and inversions easily convey a dramatic tone, subtleties, like flexing my feet instead of pointing them, are just as important. To practice these nuances, I play the \\'alphabet game\\' while training, contorting my body into as many letters as I can throughout a piece. Creativity and self-expression serve as the very building blocks of this performance art. Because of aerial silk\\'s novelty, few restrictions exist. Consequently, while training, I can often invent new poses and tricks at a whim or add variations to existing ones- for instance, incorporating a turn right instead of left, or performing an inversion instead of a pull up. Every moment on the silks is a new frontier, a new puzzle to be cracked, a new trick just waiting to be created. This creativity even permeates an aerialist\\'s language, where, to the outsider, the words \\'flippy,\\' \\'monkey hang,\\' and \\'waterfall\\' spoken in rapid succession sound like a child\\'s gibberish, yet amongst aerialists, is the key to an entire performance\\'s choreography. Here, there are no rules. My mind is always sharp, ready to invent new tricks and incorporate varying stylistic interpretations (all the greater when hanging upside down!).To most, the world seems a chaotic, mystifying entity. We ask ourselves questions like: \\'Why does the Earth shake?\\' or \\'What exists in the depths of our oceans?\\' Yet amidst this entropic system of colliding molecules, turbulent eddies, and the like, science manages to find answers. My love for science is rooted in this ideology; it is a way to understand the world\\'s complexity, yet simultaneously, appreciate the beauty behind it. Geological and cosmological processes have baffled people for thousands of years, from the warping of space-time to the mechanisms behind seafloor spreading. To better understand these processes, I take academic competition at my school, studying for the National Science Bowl, BioOlympiad, and Oceans Bowl. My specialties, however, are astronomy and earth science. Since studying the topic, my understanding (and consequent appreciation) of the world has increased considerably. For instance, when hiking in Bryce Canyon, I no longer admire just the aesthetics of the towering red hoodoos. Now, I understand the mechanisms behind their formation, from frost wedging to the volcanic flows which formed them, making the landscape all the more beautiful. On August 12th, I drive my friends out to the Santa Monica Mountains at night to see the Perseid showers, often pointing out Merak and Dubhe up to Polaris, all the while explaining their proper motion. Beyond school and my personal life, I have interned at the UCLA Medical Laboratory of Intestinal Regeneration, culturing and photographing smooth muscle cells. No longer was the human body a mere mass of tissue; working on a cellular level let me see every interacting component down to the last mitochondrion. More recently, I interned at the Stanford Hopkins Marine Station. There, I examined squids\\' diets through dissection and sonar sounding processes. While there, I began to understand the role squids played in the ocean\\'s ecosystem as a whole. The once mystifying, turbulent ocean seemed much clearer with food webs linking it into one unified \\'organism.\\'Experiences like these have ultimately shaped my understanding of the world, helping me better appreciate the Earth as a whole.Miles away from Taipei, tucked away in the mountains, lies Li Dao- the village where I spent my summer two years ago, teaching thirty children how to read, write, and speak English. When a family friend had first invited me, I was ecstatic. Teaching was something I loved and going would help improve my own Mandarin. However, it was only until I arrived that I realized the enormity of my responsibilities. Not only did I have to maintain my own room and board, but I had to cook my students\\' meals as well. My thirty pupils were also of varying ages and levels; some knew nouns, while others only fragments of the alphabet. Progress was sometimes so slow that I had to revise weeks of prepared lesson plans. Moreover, they stigmatized English, and our lack of connection only furthered their minimal and apathetic participation. As discouraging as this was, I was even more disappointed by my own inability to communicate. The language barrier was unyielding, creating a rift between me and my surroundings. In class, I was unable to congratulate students. During lectures, I stumbled over words. This isolation was only furthered through my minimal contact with others; the only familiar face was my family friend who briefly dropped off produce I needed to cook each week, and I had no phone.One day after a particularly grueling lesson, a student, with whom I had previously struggled, shuffled towards me. Upon seeing him, I braced myself for complaints, but instead was greeted with a request for the English translation of \\'uncle.\\' I answered him, surprised by his vulnerability. His interest spread quickly- students soon approached me shouting new vocabulary like \\'carrot!\\' or seeking nightly tutoring. One student even grabbed my hand and led me to a temple that overlooked the entire mountainside. Admittedly, my Mandarin is still far from perfect. My students, however, can now conjugate verbs, use basic nouns, and hold a conversation. I\\'m incredibly proud of them and their academic growth, and fortunate to have inspired a part of it, along with the creation of a community.Education is highly prioritized in my family. Though I had many toys as a child, I had twice the amount of books. My parents always urged me to push myself in school, taking advantage of afterschool programs, from programming to fencing. However with this opportunistic approach came a subtle yet undeniable expectation to do well. I was consequently funneled into the upper echelons of my class, taking the rigorous courses alongside a series of extracurriculars on the weekend.However, rather than being afflicted by this pressure, resenting or refusing it, I\\'ve thrived. Learning new things is exciting\\\\u2014I mean, who would\\'ve guessed that the universe was flat or that a group of merry pranksters had actually driven through America in a bus covered in Day-Glo?Admittedly, I\\'ve taken a little liberty in the interpretation of my parents\\' opportunistic maxim. While their ideology remains rooted in academics, I\\'ve strayed, learning unconventional instruments like the ukulele and harp. I\\'ll get lost in books, having read Les Miserables in a week. I\\'ll click on a page in Wikipedia about super-Earths only to wind through a maze of hyperlinks and end up reading about G\\\\u00f6del\\'s incompleteness theorem. However, as useless as these esoteric factoids may seem, not knowing them would be inconceivable.My appreciation for academia and learning has ultimately caused me to share it with others. Consequently, at school, I offer free tutoring in all subjects, and private lessons in music for elementary and middle school students. Before tests, I create and record lectures reviewing material for my peers. And, as irritating as it may seem, when someone asks for help on a problem, I never give them the actual answer; rather, I teach them the methodology so they can apply it to other problems. In retrospect, I thank my parents for my values and my schools for their support. These influences have resulted in an intrapersonal chaos theory\\\\u2014 unusual activities engendering unforeseen consequences\\\\u2014strengthening my (and hopefully everyone else\\'s) continual desire to know more. Looking onwards, I only hope to continue to influence and contribute to this dynamic at the University of California.\"}, {\"index\": 187, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Freshman and Sophomore year of high school I tutored 1st graders at Kempton Elementary in math and reading.

The MBTI is based on the research of Carl G. Young, who introduced the theory of psychological types. Through a series of questions designed to identify a person\\'s preferences, the MBTI test classifies them as one of sixteen psychological types. Each type is labelled with a combination of four letters, derived from a possible eight letters: E or I, S or N, T or F, J or P. These pairs of letters represent extraversion or introversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, and judging or perceiving. Studying the results of the MBTI can help a person understand how they respond to other people and the world around them, which can help them to navigate life in a way that better supports their own personality type. When I first took the MBTI personality test, I did not think too much of it, but when it was administered to me again during my time in the Upward Bound Program as a way to help me choose a career, I began to take a greater interest in learning about it. It intrigued me that the theory behind MBTI is that the seemingly random variations in human behavior are not really random. Using the MBTI, human behavior can be identified in a structured and orderly fashion. I love the structure and order to math and science, so I decided to learn more about this system which quantifies personality and human behavior.Once my interest was sparked, I encouraged all of my close friends to take the personality test as well. Reading about each of their types was eerily accurate. Their personality types both confirmed traits about them that I already knew and revealed traits that I had overlooked or never considered. Comparing how the personality types of two people interact is even more intriguing; I can know, for example, why friend A motivates me more than friend B, or why friend C always acts more reserved around me, but not friend D. This analysis of how two types interact has helped me the most in my relationship with my girlfriend. Researching about each of our personality types has helped us both to communicate more effectively and to resolve conflicts when we encounter them. Having a partner as equally enthused about personality indexing encourages me to continue my research into MBTI.After researching at length about MBTI, I have discovered that it is applicable to almost every aspect of life. By researching their personality type, a person can gain valuable insight into their possible career interests, relationship goals, friendship connections, learning styles, and many other facets of life. I plan to continue researching MBTI with my family, friends, partner, and on my own so that I may further improve myself and my relationships.\"}, {\"index\": 189, \"new_personal_statement\": \"In second grade, I received my first pair of prescription glasses.Those oval lenses, while improving the images I saw around me, marked a steep decline in the image I saw of myself. Before glasses, I was too nearsighted to see images of my sister calling herself fat in the mirror as she examined her thin body; I was too nearsighted to see magazines lining aisles of grocery stores with covers displaying what a \\'beautiful\\' woman looked like. And while my glasses gave me the ability to see clearly these outside images that were impressed upon my eight year old mind, it\\'s ironic that, they also stripped me of the pure, innocent clarity with which I viewed myself.Over time, the concave lenses meant to correct my vision acted more like concave mirrors in a carnival fun house, leading to the start of my battle with anorexia.Though it\\'s easy to blame my decline in self-esteem on these inanimate objects, the true bearers of blame were the people that made me feel insecure about my glasses in the first place. I was ostracized for being \\'nerdy,\\' and the stereotypical connotation of glasses did not help.Their words were soon reinforced by my own self doubt. I thought that if I was thinner, more people would like me. And as I chipped away at myself, I needed something to fill the empty voids I created. Soon, even amidst the uproar of disparaging voices from everyone around me, it just so happened that I heard and was given purpose by the still, small voice I call God. That voice emerged over the lies that had been fed to me like the food I had avoided. \\'My Masterpiece,\\' He said as He looked into my broken soul that I had been taught to hate. As I began to love myself again, I realized the need for more love in the world. It was in that moment of clarity that I decided to pursue science because I believed then, as I do now, that science truly has the power to change the world. To me, if I knew that my life\\'s work would make a lasting impact on the world, then it didn\\'t matter what the bullies in my life thought. To gain their acceptance was now such a trivial problem compared to the struggles faced by so many. For the struggling, I began to change the perspective I had seen myself through. For the impoverished, I poured myself into this new calling, driving an hour every day after school to conduct research. For the destitute, I embarked on this wonderful path of self discovery. In science, I felt accepted. In science, I felt whole, livened by the complexity of each experiment and my ability to make change. My passion carried me to Intel\\'s International Science and Engineering Fair where I connected with individuals that gave a new meaning to the word \\'nerd.\\' In this place, everyone and no one was considered a \\'nerd.\\' In this place, I felt empowered by my peers and validated for my research, placing fourth internationally.  I didn\\'t know it then, but realize now that the saying \\'It\\'s not you but them\\' is wrong. It was me. It was always me, but not in the negative sense that is associated with the phrase. It is in the powerful sense that is displayed through this woman I have become. This realization led me to exceptional heights in my science career and will no doubt lead me higher. I am no longer the reflection of derogatory comments; I am now the initiator, executor, and conqueror of the dreams that were deemed \\'too big.\\' I still wear my glasses. But clarity is a process that I am still learning, still learning to love myself inside and out. And slowly, those lenses that caused me to lose sight of myself are turning into symbols of personal growth that I proudly emblazon.To the woman at the basketball game,I saw you. I saw the way you looked at us. We were just sitting there, minding our own business, but you made a point to turn around and scoff at the contrast of our skin. Your disapproving eyes traveled the lengths of our bodies, lingering ever so slightly on our interlocked hands then continuing upward to meet my appalled gaze. You quickly turned back around, and thank God, because I don\\'t know what I would have done had you not. I wanted to give you something to look at, make a scene, and relinquish this dam of rage that was building up inside me. I wanted to shame you for the thoughts that were so evident on your face, thoughts of prejudice and discrimination expressed through your upturned nose.

They\\'re opposite ends of a beautiful spectrum of light, encompassing every color of the rainbow in between. He is far from my opposite, but I am proud of our cultural differences. I am proud of the color of his skin and his family background because it adds so much diversity to my own.

A glance at my notebook reveals a collection of worn pages covered with meticulously planned formations, counts, and movements. Through sharing videos of my performances with my relatives or discovering and choreographing the nuances of certain regional dances and their reflection on the region\\'s distinct culture, I deepen my relationship with my parents, heritage, and community. When I step on stage, the hours I\\'ve spent choreographing, creating poses, teaching, and polishing are all worthwhile, and the stage becomes my home.Set temperature. Calibrate. Integrate. Analyze. Set temperature. Calibrate. Integrate. Analyze. This pulse mimics the beating of my heart, a subtle rhythm that persists each day I come into the lab. Whether I am working under the fume hood with platinum nanoparticles, manipulating raw integration data, or spraying a thin platinum film over pieces of copper, it is in Lab 304 in Hudson Hall that I first feel the distinct sensation, and I\\'m home. After spending several weeks attempting to synthesize platinum nanoparticles with a diameter between 10 and 16 nm, I finally achieve nanoparticles with a diameter of 14.6 nm after carefully monitoring the sulfuric acid bath. That unmistakable tingling sensation dances up my arm as I scribble into my notebook: I am overcome with a feeling of unbridled joy. Styled in a t-shirt, shorts, and a worn, dark green lanyard, I sprint across the quad from the elective \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Speaking Arabic through the Rassias Method\\' to \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Knitting Nirvana\\'. This afternoon is just one of many at Governor\\'s School East, where I have been transformed from a high school student into a philosopher, a thinker, and an avid learner. While I attend GS at Meredith College for Natural Science, the lessons learned and experiences gained extend far beyond physics concepts, serial dilutions, and toxicity. I learn to trust myself to have difficult yet necessary conversations about the political and economic climate. Governor\\'s School breeds a culture of inclusivity and multidimensionality, and I am transformed from \\'girl who is hardworking\\' or \\'science girl\\' to someone who indulges in the sciences, debates about psychology and the economy, and loves to swing and salsa dance. As I form a slip knot and cast on, I\\'m at home.My home is a dynamic and eclectic entity. Although I\\'ve lived in the same house in Cary, North Carolina for 10 years, I have found and carved homes and communities that are filled with and enriched by tradition, artists, researchers, and intellectuals. While I may not always live within a 5 mile radius of a Bojangle\\'s or in close proximity to Lab 304, learning to become a more perceptive daughter and sister, to share the beauty of my heritage, and to take risks and redefine scientific and personal expectations will continue to impact my sense of home.\"}, {\"index\": 191, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Before I even started school, I discovered that I had a connection with math.

The bottle-blond cashier\\\\u2014Erica, her nametag reads\\\\u2014huffs impatiently and examines her scarlet nails. Behind us is a line of grumbling customers, shifting from one foot to the other, annoyance emanating from every pore. I observe all of this in shamed silence, arms crossed as if it would protect me from the accusing stares. The cause of the turmoil? The colorful pieces of paper lying innocuously on the cashier\\'s scanner\\\\u2014coupons.When I was younger, about 12 or 13 years old (the awkward years), the shame burned a hole in my chest. I couldn\\'t look anyone in the eyes, I bit my lip until I tasted iron, and I prayed to any and all deities that the transaction would be quick and manager-free. Sometimes I wanted to sink into the ground. Other times I cowardly abandoned my mom for the magazine aisle, a smiling Zac Efron a welcome respite from the judgmental stares. I didn\\'t want to be attached to the stereotype: the petite, Asian woman, trying to discount already discounted items, haggling with the customer service representative in broken English. I was jealous of my friends who threw bags of chips into their carts without looking at the price, grabbing only one jar of salsa even though it was buy-one-get- one-free. Their parents didn\\'t even look at the receipt\\\\u2014just handed over their credit card.I used to resent how I could never do something without caring about the price, how I could never attend birthday parties or socials. I was ashamed of my image, my heritage, my background. But as the years went on, and as I matured, I grew to realize that it was unfair to both my mom and myself to feel that way. Shame, embarrassment and guilt\\\\u2014how could I feel this way? When all my mother did was try her hardest to make me happy\\\\u2014saving money so we could afford a nice house, quality clothes, healthy food\\\\u2014how could I resent her? I began to see my mother in a new light. I saw her resourcefulness in finding ways to save money in all parts of our budget. I saw her determination and fortitude when she returned from work with bloodshot eyes and the stale scent of cigarettes sticking to her Hard Rock Casino uniform. I saw her optimism when she smiled everyday despite her struggles.Instead of seeing weakness, I saw strength. I resolved to be more like my mother\\\\u2014and to become a role model for others. I aspired to be resourceful, determined, optimistic, and strong in the face of opposition or judgment.Those revelations have carried me to this day. I thought of my mother\\'s strength and determination at her casino job when it was 2 am and I still wasn\\'t done with homework. I thought of my mother\\'s resourcefulness with coupons when I tried to find ways to go to summer camps I could never afford otherwise. I thought of my mother\\'s optimism and can-do attitude when it seemed like I could never pull off a successful open-mic night on the first day of summer; when school was the last place anyone would want to go. My mother\\'s lessons have carried me to success thus far. I got through a brutal junior year with stellar grades and a strong SAT score. I received a full scholarship to attend a summer program for art. The open-mic night was a smash success, with tons of students attending and sharing their talents, stories, poems, and dreams.I went to Publix with my mom today. She still uses coupons. Yet, rather than running away like I did when I was thirteen years old, I stood tall, looked the cashier in the eyes, made small talk with the bagger, and held my mom\\'s purse as she sorted through her coupon book.\"}, {\"index\": 194, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The first time I went to the symphony\\\\u2014Tchaikovsky\\'s Romeo and Juliet\\\\u2014by myself, I took the essentials: my phone to communicate with my parents, my water bottle to stay hydrated, and The Fountainhead to keep anyone from wanting to talk to me.Despite being packed full of well-dressed adults, Benaroya Hall seemed cavernous when I went alone. I found my seat, opened my book, and pretended to be riveted by the concept of hating poor people for being poor. As the audience filtered into the hall, I shrank deeper into my chair and read a bit harder, trying not to make eye contact or take up my neighbors\\' armrest space. But as the lights dimmed, the orchestra tuned, and the conductor strode onstage, I relaxed, my fear of seeming out of place forgotten.I can go to symphonies thanks to TeenTix, a Seattle nonprofit that promotes youth arts engagement by allowing teens to buy $5 tickets to almost every art venue\\\\u2014visual, musical, theatrical, and movement-based\\\\u2014in the city. It was my TeenTix pass that allowed me to go to that first symphony concert alone. But even though I relished the experience, I couldn\\'t help feeling like my cheaper ticket meant I deserved my seat less than the full-paying, real-collared-shirt-wearing grownups around me.Since my first symphony concert, I\\'ve used my TeenTix pass to see everything from Mozart operas to a play about growing up as a queer Latino. I wish I could say that first concert experience gave me all the confidence I needed. The truth was, my desire to see shows was always greater than my fear of sticking out, so I bit back my insecurities and went anyway.With each new ticket stub I\\'ve collected, I\\'ve become more secure in the idea that I\\\\u2014and all teens\\\\u2014deserve to see art as much as adults. That\\'s why I joined TeenTix\\'s leadership board: to help make arts access possible for teens who might otherwise never consider going to a gallery or theater.Realizing that everyone deserves to see art regardless of their status is one thing; believing everyone has the power to create art is another. However, I\\'ve been working on that, too. I\\'ve done improv comedy for four years, and though it requires no set, script, or costumes, I\\'d always assumed producing shows was best left to adults. But when my improv group wanted to perform more often than adults could help us with, I produced an improvised episode of the TV show Survivor on my own. It drew an enthusiastic and (paying!) audience. I\\'m working on the next installment, which will be performed at a tiny independent theatre in December. I want to blur the line between adults and teens in the arts\\\\u2014on and off the stage\\\\u2014by moving into territory that has traditionally been thought to be for grown-ups.I won\\'t be a teen much longer and, sadly, I don\\'t think AdultTix exists (yet). For now, I\\'m relishing the sight of my worn jeans in plush symphony seats and the sound of improv audiences yelling suggestions at the stage. And when I leave Seattle to become a full-fledged, collared-shirt wearing adult, I hope to bring that arts accessibility to the teens in the next city I call home.The last time I went to the opera\\\\u2014Puccini\\'s Madame Butterfly\\\\u2014by myself, I took the essentials: my phone and water bottle, but not The Fountainhead.

My goal is to spark people\\'s curiosity for scientific research.Many of my family members did not have an interest in education. Some turned to gangs and drugs. My parents, however, deviated from such a pattern and constantly reminded me of the opportunities they did not have growing up, and the struggles they dealt with. So, every year, I travel to the dusty metropolis of Cochabamba, Bolivia with one clear goal: empower children to continue their education. Dropping papers for my lectures as I hectically ran through a dense mass of people to catch my ride, I donated materials to high schools and taught their students; these were my moments of empowerment for I regained the connection to my motherland which I left so long ago and strengthened my life-long goals.This is my foundation\\\\u2014the foundation that has taught me what my passion is: to be a leader as a scientist, humanitarian, and educator, and contribute towards the public good, especially in the Hispanic community. With this, I hope to one day teach at a university with the goal of increasing the diversity in academia. My long-term vision is to be a professional advisor and advocate for non-profit organizations around the world to spread early access to quality STEM education.

We were planning to head directly to the Samsung Experience Shop. I could not wait to test the features of the new Galaxy Note 3 that I had thoroughly researched online.I made a beeline over to the first table, sprawling with Samsung\\'s newest smartphones. I was excitedly engaged with the Galaxy Note 3 demo when a sixty-something-year-old woman hesitantly asked for my help with her smartphone quandary.I responded enthusiastically, ready to assist. She proceeded to outline her needs very specific to her work as a realtor. But she worried that, at her age, her technological acumen was minimal, and the smartphone that she required would be too difficult for her to use.I listened attentively and immediately knew which phone would suit the demanding schedule of a real estate salesperson with the simplicity requisite for a kind, technologically-inexperienced grandmother.\\'The Note 3,\\' I assured, \\'is exactly what you are looking for.\\' I proceeded to outline its salient features and saw the relief in her expression and demeanor when I demonstrated that she would not face an insurmountable learning curve. Through our genial forty-five-minute discourse, I convinced her to purchase a Note 3 at the Samsung Shop. I referred her to a Samsung representative who completed the transaction and activated the new phone. She thanked me endlessly for my assistance as I basked in her appreciation.Little did I know, Josh, the Samsung Experience manager, was observing the entire exchange just a table away. As my dad and I were preparing to exit the store, Josh breathlessly caught up to us. He remarked how knowledgeable I was and asked if I would be interested in a job.Amusedly and somewhat incredulously, my dad asked how old one must be to work as a Samsung employee. \\'Eighteen,\\' Josh replied, presuming I was older than my actual years.I was certainly flattered as I was only fourteen at the time.

Even my grandmother\\'s unshakeable faith and counsel failed to renew my faith. My responses to friends\\' occasional questions about Hinduism grew increasingly concise, even acquiescing.But the Why? Question remained incessant. I read Heller, Tagore, and finally Vonnegut, who wrote: \\'Tiger got to sleep. Bird got to land. Man got to tell himself he understand.\\' The words slapped me across the face. I realized I had been desperately searching for my purpose through faith in a religion of fantastical, fictional fables that I knew, deep in my heart, couldn\\'t be true. Oh, puny Hindu, Vonnegut whispered to me. You\\'re one of billions on this little planet, and of billions before you. They all come, and they all go. What makes you think you matter?And so, in my spiritual distress, I returned to the physical setting of my internal conflict, a place, I had visited seldom since childhood: our Hindu temple. The statues and murals, still alluringly beautiful, offered no consolation. Finally, in a moment of salvational serendipity I realized what I had been missing the whole time: the people on the carpets around me. Family, friends, neighbors, even strangers. We sat separately, but prayed in harmony and sacred unity.Maybe, Vonnegut was both right and wrong. Correct, perhaps, in his assessment that life may not have a concrete, comprehensible purpose, but incorrect in failing to see the meaning within the search itself. Religion is a manifestation of this search - its importance does not lie in its accuracy, but rather in its ability to unify and bring meaning.What Vonnegut and my fellow Hindus helped me realize was that our search for purpose may be the very thing that proves the presence of meaning in life. We search together in spiritual fellowship; that we search proves there is something to search for. This journey that we all share qualifies itself. There is no final answer, there is only this great process, one that we are all bound to in life.Today, I am religious, but my faith is not just a Hindu one. It is a faith in my fellow man, a faith in love, and a faith in the necessity my lifelong question: Why?So, somewhat ironically in the words of Vonnegut: \\'Live by the harmless untruths that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy.\\' These untruths, then, are those that bring us together.And, just as it was written thousands of years ago in the Hindu Vedas:The experience of unityis the fulfillment of human endeavors.The mysteries of life are revealed.\"}, {\"index\": 198, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Prompt: Please provide a statement that addresses your reasons for transferring and the objectives you hope to achieve. (Max 650 words).My religious and intellectual journey thus far, much like my ancient ancestors\\' wanderings through the wilderness,has been both painful and revelatory. Growing up, I attended an ultra-Orthodox high school, or Yeshiva, where Iwould study Talmud for upwards of six hours a day and was strongly discouraged from engaging with anyperspectives outside of Orthodox Judaism. There, as a devoted student eager to spend my days immersed in theholy and exhilarating wonders of the Talmud, I thrived. At the time, the notion that we need not and should notengage with any perspectives outside of our tradition made utmost sense to me; after all, why engage with othersif only we possess the divine, unadulterated truth?With that orientation, I set out after high school to an ultra-Orthodox seminary in Israel to continue my religiousstudies in a similarly sheltered environment. There, I spent my days exploring the breadth and depth of the Jewishtradition and developed a profound, religious passion for Judaism. However, over the ensuing months and years, Ifound that the more I engaged with the religion that was so dear to my heart, the less capable I became ofmaintaining my faith. As my studies progressed, biblical criticism loomed like a serpent threatening to swallow thecore of who I was and searing moral and ethical problems posed by Judaism\\'s sacred texts and laws plagued mymind and conscience.Eventually, the burden of these unrelenting doubts forced me to venture out of my mini-universe on a quest foranswers. I began to explore a broad array of liberal and progressive Jewish thinkers who had been off-limits to mein my youth, including Abraham Joshua Heschel, Franz Rosenzweig, and Mordecai Kaplan. Ultimately, thisexploration led me to embrace a more open-minded and pluralistic vision of religion that recognizes the findings ofmodern scholarship, is fully committed to engaging with varying and divergent perspectives, and does not claim amonopoly on truth or wisdom.Now, still passionate about Judaism, I long to continue my Jewish studies in a world class academic environmentdevoted to critical, intellectual pursuit. However, my current academic home, Lander College for Men, is a JewishOrthodox institution and only offers Jewish studies courses from a prescribed traditional perspective.Additionally, to reach my full potential as a student and person, I now long to wrestle with not only Judaism\\'s bigideas, but also with the broader, vast, and magnificent expanse of human moral, political, and religious thought. Iyearn to study ethics and political philosophy, examine major world religions, and explore the literature, history,and beliefs of cultures and traditions that are presently wholly foreign to me. However, Lander College is primarilyfocused on preparing students for specific professional careers such as Medicine, Law, and Accounting and doesnot offer a wide selection of courses in the liberal arts or humanities.Finally, having come to realize the immeasurable value of engaging with a multiplicity of perspectives, I now cravea diverse academic and social environment where I can broaden and sharpen my own point of view. I hope tolearn from peers and teachers of varying backgrounds, identities, and religious and political orientations. However,at Lander College, as the entire student body and much of the faculty are male, Orthodox Jews, I feel that therange of perspectives with which I can engage is inherently limited.I don\\'t know where my religious and intellectual journey will ultimately take me. However, to continue my journey, Iknow that I need to find a new academic home where I can study broadly and sincerely engage with the rich anddiverse world around me.\"}, {\"index\": 199, \"new_personal_statement\": \"A curly blond haired girl stares up inquisitively, puzzled and perplexed attempting to decipher the odd sounds mouthed from her family members\\' lips. \\'Je t\\'aime, ma ch\\\\u00e9rie!\\' \\'Que linda! Es una mu\\\\u00f1eca.\\' \\'How cute, she\\'s adorable.\\' Confusion sets in: she only understands fragments of this conversation. As a three-year-old girl moving from France to Miami, I only spoke and understood French. My inability to communicate landed me in the principal\\'s office the first week of school. My infraction? Pulling other girls\\' ponytails to finally get my turn on the swings.As my language skills developed, concepts became clearer. I began to understand these foreign conversations and my childhood cloud of confusion was transformed into comprehension, igniting my inquisitiveness. At the daily dinner table, I would relish listening to my father rant about French politics and \\'mi abuelo Cubano\\' cursing Castro and recounting the horrors of my Dutch grandmother\\'s ordeal in a Japanese concentration camp in Indonesia during WWII. These fascinating stories prompted me to ask questions and learn about the historical and cultural traditions of my diverse background. I became entranced and impassioned by history, often researching about D-Day and Normandy to be able to partake in my father\\'s zealous conversations with his friends. These heated discussions taught me to broach controversial topics and participate in intellectually stimulating conversations with people of opposing views. This undoubtedly set the foundation for my venture into debate at school. Whereas in kindergarten my ability to speak French was a hindrance to communicating, now my languages have become an advantage, opening the doors to new and exciting worlds. From deliberately burnt ratatouille to frijoles and platanos, my origins not only allow me to savor the flavors of various cultural cuisines, but also engage in conversations ranging from Nutella crepes and Nouvelle Vague French cinema to Cuban coffee and the Cha-cha-cha. These curious and, at times, comical conversations have taught me to more easily establish deep connections and friendships with persons of varying backgrounds.My cross-cultural identity not only motivated me to learn about my own particular heritage and its struggles, but also made me yearn to discover the plight and intricacies of others around the world. Captivated by culture, I aimlessly stroll the aisles of museums, spending hours absorbing art, artifacts, artists and the history of other nations. Fortunate enough to have traveled to other countries and continents, I have witnessed both the beauty and uniqueness of different societies and conversely, the misery and corruption that plague them. These eye-opening travels coupled with the stories of my family\\'s struggles and my Sacred Heart upbringing have inspired me to serve my school and local community. As a student of the Sacred Heart I have strived to emulate the goal that teaches students to \\'commit themselves to develop a social awareness that compels them to action.\\' These powerful influences have led me to open the Miami Chapter of Students Against Melanoma (in memory of my grandfather), organize Relay for Life, and volunteer as a retreat leader in Campus Ministry. Although my actions may be small and local in nature, I aspire to one day be able to continue my dedication to service on a larger, more global scale. I hope I will be given the opportunity to continue my commitment to service and to share my family\\'s unique history at college. I, likewise, look forward to learning more about other cultures that I have yet to discover and experience. While outsiders may consider my multicultural background what the Cubans call \\'un arroz con mango\\', a confusing combination of ingredients, I prefer to believe and live by the motto coined by William Cowper\\'s poem, \\'The Task\\': \\'Variety is the very spice of life, that gives it all its flavor.\\' Yours truly,Tarina Lily Touret, the \\'Fruban\\' (French-Cuban)\"}, {\"index\": 200, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I met Ziva in an unexpected text from my mother. Ziva is a Shepherd mix, she wrote, followed by a photograph of a young dog with wide brown eyes radiating warmth through the latticework of her cage. Caramel- colored eyebrows stood out against her dark coat, her expression permanently surprised, yet friendly.The text came after my mother had discovered Ziva on Facebook. When we squeezed into the small room at the Town of North Hempstead Animal Shelter, Ziva initially hung back in the corner. Eventually, she jumped up to lick my mother\\'s hands, simultaneously crouching and wagging her tail. We adopted her later that week.Once home, Ziva silently lounged in her pillowy bed for days. We wondered what her bark sounded like; soon, she woke up, running from room to room singing in loud whimpers whenever a newcomer came to the door. She broke off her leash several times despite my commands to walk by my side, and I once chased her for three blocks in a foot of snow while she hunted a squirrel. The first time I gave her a bath, I ended up in the tub while she smiled triumphantly from the other side of the bathroom, still dry. She dug holes in the backyard and trampled the flowerbeds of cucumbers and peppers.Ziva was definitely not a perfect dog that people follow on Instagram, who idyllically sit at a dining table eating a steak or pose with sunglasses on a pool raft. I had a lot to teach her. I purchased a book by Cesar Millan and read about the many different methods he used to train dogs. I adopted this inventive approach as I trained Ziva, drawing upon creative skills I never knew I had. When Ziva didn\\'t respond to my first approach of clapping my hands to invite her to meet someone new, I personally introduced her. I stayed by her side with a bone until she felt comfortable enough to independently leave her place beneath the table. I managed to coax her into the bath by feeding her sliced vegetables instead of her regular training- nibblers.As I figure out what her different barks and whines mean, I understand myself and I understand Ziva. She has taught me how to approach problems without a fixed solution. The path I followed training Ziva was never a paved road, allowing me to create my own detours.  I apply this mindset to other activities in my life. When I get lost during a run in Alley Pond Park, instead of immediately retracing my steps, I use landmarks to find other routes out.It seems fitting given that Ziva means \\'light\\' in Hebrew. I now approach problems looking for unique resolutions, rather than ruminating about the difficulties or frustrations. When Ziva continued to paw at the door wanting to join us outside during the Eclipse, I placed a pair of solar glasses behind her ears and invited her outside. I captured her, smiling, smelly, in a picture before she shook them off. Ziva may not be a flawless Instagram dog, but she comes close enough for me.\"}, {\"index\": 201, \"new_personal_statement\": \"On the first Sunday of every month, I skip over to the Baskin-Robbins around the corner. My black hair flows in the wind as I joyously hum Here Comes the Sun. When I enter the ice cream shop, the ding of the bell soothes me while slightly jolting the store clerk behind the tubs of chocolate and milk. With a jump and a glowing smile, I order the same thing as always:\\'One scoop of vanilla with rainbow sprinkles, please.\\'Once I receive my order, my eyes gravitate toward the bright colors while my tongue indulges in the sweet, yet starchy, crunch. The oases of reds, blues, and oranges bleed into the vanilla ice cream, creating a symphony of color. Rainbow sprinkles are the stars of the show.My friends say that my love for rainbow sprinkles is a passion fueled by nostalgia. Maybe it is just that. Every time my taste buds are granted the colorful confection, I am transported to when my dad would treat me to ice cream as he sat down with a piece of paper, willing to engage in any topic or question I asked.The first time, I asked my dad to describethe dystopian world of Animal Farm. I watched in awe as my dad quickly scribbled stick figures that vaguely looked like pigs. He smiled sheepishly, apologizing for his creation, but I thought it was a masterpiece. He then detailed with many curvy arrows the intricate connections between Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer. While he exposed the metaphors in the text, a new world opened. Sure, many kids idolize their parents, but I knew my dad was brilliant. In later lessons, my dad would draw diagrams as he told me about the complex plane and how imaginary numbers can coexist in harmony with the numbers I knew so well. Or he wrote Pinyin as he explained the phonetic difference between Shanghainese and Mandarin.For a couple of years, these lessons were simply a way for me to expand my perspective while getting closer to my dad. I longed for our tutorials, quenching my thirst for knowledge and satisfying my hunger for rainbow sprinkles. Out of all of them, though, I had a soft spot for the literature and mathematics lessons. As I sat in algebra one day, the ice-cream lessons transformed into something completely different. The unsolved variable x metamorphosed into a character from a novel. By solving for x, I was going through x\\'s journey. X became Jay Gatsby, Edward Rochester, or Madame Loisel. By making myself more invested in x, what seemed like a mundane task at the time turned into something intriguing. Afterwards, I started to see connections betweenthe rushed brushstrokes in paintings and the equation of work in mechanical physics, between American football formations and historical war strategies. My awe and curiosity grew as I focused on the filaments between fields, seeing the whole world in a new light. By connecting what seemed to be unrelated, my education was no longer a constrained experience, but an immersive one.When I now look at the rainbow sprinkles, I see what I love so much about learning. Each color is a different subject, and when they mix, they make a dazzling rainbow that builds off of every hue. While the sprinkles look different, they all come together, bringing an almost too-good-to-be-true saccharine taste, and that is how I see our world. It may look like it is made of separate entities, but all of them enhance each other cohesively.And that, like taking a bite of vanilla ice cream with rainbow sprinkles, is incredibly satisfying.There\\'s a feeling of euphoria that is irreplaceable. Some get it from making the winning touchdown. Others get it from performing their symphony.Meanwhile, the program I wrote runs on the terminal, and I wait anxiously, hoping that I successfully debugged my code.3...2...1...Let the euphoria begin.As someone who loves solving riddles and problems, coding gives me a rush. I love thinking logically and building algorithms one step at a time. Coding is my own puzzle: by fitting together the right functions, I can create a beautiful picture.I started coding in the Brown Scholars program at the American Museum of Natural History. In the first year, I learned the basics of programming for scientific research. In the next year, I interned at the Exhibitions Department. I noticed during the program how interactive coding truly is. It\\'s not just sitting in front of a computer; it\\'s a collaborative process where everyone chips in to create a final working product. I also learned about the fusion of hardware and software, as I worked with Raspberry Pis and Arduinos to create exhibitions.I\\'ve done more than creating exhibits. In my computer science classes in school, including AP and post-AP courses, I built websites and video games from scratch with HTML, Python, CSS, and Processing. I also spent two summers at NYU to hone my Python skills: I learned how to write encryption algorithms at a cybersecurity camp before my junior year and learned how to implement machine learning algorithms to create predictive data models before my senior year. All these experiences, while different in scope, only made me love computer science more. The most irresistible part of coding to me is still that euphoric feeling that rushes through me when my program solves a hard problem. That is irreplaceable.When I was first introduced to the Locksmith, Key Club\\'s newsletter, it was not living up to its potential. It was published sporadically with an unappealing format and text copied-and-pasted directly from emails. I envisioned the Locksmith as a strong voice to spread the great work of the volunteers at the Key Club. Therefore, I decided to make a difference by revitalizing the Locksmith.At the end of my sophomore year, I became the Locksmith Director. I immediately created a small committee dedicated to the publication and developed an execution plan. The plan consisted of three major components: advertising the Locksmith through emails and Facebook posts, developing a point-based reward system to motivate members to submit articles and photos, and refreshing the layout to make it look enticing. With relentless efforts, my team successfully improved the content and increased the influence of the Locksmith. Now, we have 50 regular contributors and hundreds reading and sharing every issue. The Locksmith has grown into a monthly publication with over 60 pages of riveting stories and smiling Key Clubbers. For my \\'exceptional leadership\\' in transforming the Locksmith, I received the sole Distinguished Committee Director award from Stuyvesant Key Club.I am now the Editor of the Locksmith and overseeing all publications of the Key Club. I am proud of my success in changing the Locksmith into a publication that is at the core of Key Club. With the expanded outreach of the newsletter, Key Club\\'s membership has increased by 40 percent. The culture of Key Club has changed for the better due to the new Locksmith. This is most evident when someone eagerly asks the question, \\'Will my article be in the next issue?\\'\\'Of course,\\' I respond, remembering that just a year ago, no one would have been so enthusiastic about submitting articles to the Locksmith.Every year, NYU\\'s GSTEM selects high school girls to conduct research with experienced scientists. Last summer, I was one of the fortunate few that were awarded the Winston Data Analytics Scholarship to attend this program. I worked with Dr. Rob Barton to build a data model predicting housing prices with machine learning algorithms. Because I knew so little about data science, I went into the program a bit nervous but excited.I immediately enrolled in a machine learning course on Coursera by Andrew Ng. I watched every course video, read every resource, and took many notes, making sure I understood everything. Before I knew it, I could explain concepts like gradient descent and ridge regression with confidence. I then created a data model that could predict housing prices using the regression algorithms I learned on Coursera. I submitted it to the Kaggle Zillow Price competition and waited a few anxious seconds to see my placement.I was ranked 1,583rd out of 1,700 competitors.Naturally, I was crushed, even though I was competing against professional modelers with far more experience. However, I was not deterred. I was determined to raise my ranking. I spent countless hours refining the model. I went through the data meticulously to understand the story behind each outlier, added new factors, and dropped irrelevant variables. My model\\'s predictive power gradually improved as I climbed up the Kaggle leaderboard. At my final submission, I was in the top quartile of the competitors and received a top grade of 96.4 in GSTEM for my successful data model.I had a rewarding summer participating in GSTEM. By taking advantage of the scholarship opportunity, I significantly improved my knowledge on data science and developed a great appreciation of its impact on our lives. Through hard work, I overcame difficult challenges, accomplished things that I would have never dreamed of doing at my age, and demonstrated that I am a good data scientist.\\'Next up will be Tiffany Chen presenting her first exhibit.\\'I nervously walk up with my exhibit in hand, anxious to present the electronic leaf that changes color depending on the season. As I look down at the exhibit, I remember why I wanted to create it for the Museum of Natural History. As a kid, I fell in love with the beautiful fall foliage. However, whenever I asked about the reason behind the leaves\\' color change, I always got a complicated chemistry lesson that further confused me. I wanted to create an interactive experience so kids like me can visually see the process of the leaves changing colors. However, the process of building the exhibit was not easy. At the beginning, I drew multitudes of sketches in my small black notebook, each one building off the last. I also found materials and used techniques that made the exhibit almost indestructible. To keep the LEDs together, I learned how to solder. In a few weeks, the exhibit came together, with a functioning leaf and knobs that can change the season.I then worked on the code for the leaf. I wanted the users to have as much an interactive experience as possible. To do this, I emphasized the difference between the bud and the leaf so that users can learn how the two entities work together. I also made sure that the seasons changed smoothly, programming each LED to not change color abruptly unless when the leaf fell off. Looking down at my exhibit, I feel a sense of accomplishment. Even though the exhibit itself is small, it can leave a lasting impression on those who have experienced it. I know that many kids will benefit from this exhibit and be motivated to learn more about the world we live in.I take a deep breath.\\'Hello, my name is Tiffany, and this is my interactive leaf for the newest exhibition.\\'Although you may not yet know what you want to major in, which department or program at MIT appeals to you and why?

Please address with some specificity your own wishes and how they relate to UChicago. (1-2 pages)I\\'m no Michelle Kwan, but I can manage well enough on the ice. Every winter, I find myself at an ice rink. Once the blades on my feet hit the slippery surface, I find my balance, skating slowly and sensing the environment around me. The stresses of my daily life fade as I listen to the cutting of the ice and the flow of the breeze. I glide away, free.Off the ice, I still search for balance between my interests and my pursuits. As I embark on the next stage of my life, I look for not only a launch pad for my future career but also a solid foundation with a broad perspective of the world that I can benefit from.When visiting Hyde Park this summer, I realized an education from the University of Chicago can provide me this balance. There, I was drawn to the unconventional and free-spirited thinking of its students. I believe this unique culture is attributable to UChicago\\'s Core Curriculum. The breadth of the Core allows me to explore many subjects and prepares me well for future challenges. While I examine the meaning of humanity, I can also research the mathematics of nonlinear dynamics and the mystery of dark matter. While I investigate social policy, I can also appreciate the beauty of music and art. The interdisciplinary perspective of the Core will help me build critical thinking skills and develop an out-of-the-box mindset. In my high school years, through classes, internships and summer programs, I developed a strong interest in mathematics, computer science, and economics. I did research in areas such as inversive geometry and chaos theory. I also learned the fundamentals of data science and witnessed its power first-hand when applying it to economics problems in my GSTEM and Regeneron projects, where I used machine learning algorithms to forecast housing prices and gentrification trends. At UChicago, I can continue developing my computer science skills by delving deep into theory sequence while learning real-world applications in courses such as Mobile Computing and Game Construction. UChicago also boasts first-rate math and economics departments with Fields medalists and Nobel Laureates. I will actively seek learning opportunities in this world-class environment, where I can conduct cutting-edge research under the guidance of UChicago\\'s faculties. Further, because of my family\\'s influence, I also have an interest in applying the knowledge I learned at school to the business world when I graduate. The Trott Business Program and Dougan Scholars Certificate Program are additional reasons I want to apply to Chicago. These programs allow me to get direct access to the Booth School of Business, so I can learn business first-hand from Booth\\'s world-renowned faculty and through internships and mentorships. Last, while many might be intimidated by the Windy City, I enjoy the cold and ice. Every winter, I will look forward to skating at UChicago\\'s Midway Plaisance Park ice rink, where I can find balance as I glide on the ice.Dog and Cat. Coffee and Tea. Great Gatsby and Catcher in the Rye. Everyone knows there are two types of people in the world. What are they? (1-2 pages)I love the country.Many are shocked when they first hear this. How can a girl from New York City appreciate the country life when there\\'s the hustle and bustle of the city? However, there\\'s no denying it: between being a city person or a country person, I would rather be a country person.I think I was bound to be this way. For most of my life, I have lived in the suburbs. I lived in the meadows of Connecticut, the beaches of Washington, and the forests of Ohio. I was used to the relaxed country life.Once I moved to New York City, I realized how hard it is to escape the city. Even as I walked around Central Park\\'s beautiful reservoir, I noticed how impossible it is to be alone in the city, to think to myself. I heard a few kids screaming in the playground close by; I heard the constant beat of a runner\\'s feet tapping onto the pebbles. No matter how hard I try, I\\'m surrounded by people.In moments like this, I\\'d wish that I was in Ohio. I used to live in Powell, OH, and tucked into the woods is a small park with a cerulean blue lake. It\\'s just as breathtaking as Central Park\\'s reservoir, but I feel much more at home there. I am transported to the times when I walked around the lake, my dog in my arms, indulging in his soft fur. Whenever I go back to these memories, I realize how much I miss Ohio. There\\'s this aura that emanates from nature: everything clicks perfectly together, leaving a serene atmosphere. In the country, I can think to myself, find myself.However, no matter how much I love the countryside, I cannot help but appreciate everything the city offers. All around me, there are museums and buildings that I can go into and explore. There are boutiques and shops I can walk into and window-shop. There are restaurants and cafes I can try new foods and cuisines at. There\\'s a different type of freedom that the city offers. With a swipe of my Metrocard, I can travel anywhere in New York City. I even find myself loving the people in the city; everyone comes from a different background and brings a new perspective of life. While the suburbs allow for more introspective soul-searching, the city allows for external growth, granting me a more rounded view on culture, expression, and identity.So yes, it may be hard to find peace and quiet in the city. However, with every passing day in New York City, I gradually appreciate the benefits of the city. I belong in a place that offers the opportunity to develop an outlook on myself and the world I live in, no matter whether that place is in the city or the country.\"}, {\"index\": 202, \"new_personal_statement\": \"As I burst into the house, I could smell that she had already started to saut\\\\u00e9 the onions; I was late. I rushed into the kitchen \\\\u2013 after forcefully tossing my knapsack in my bedroom\\\\u2014and assumed my place: three marble tiles away from my mother. No words were exchanged as I stood and chiffonaded the basil. My mother probably wanted her silence to echo the fact that my tardiness was unacceptable. After all, we had an unspoken agreement to be home at 5 PM sharp to cook the curry.This weekly tradition has gone on ever since I could muster up the strength to grind spices with a mortar and pestle. The smells of turmeric and curry powder flood the air every Monday night and always find a way to nuzzle themselves into the fibers of my cotton dress shirts. Sure, the pungent aroma may deviate from the other Tide-scented apparel in the hallway, but to me, it is a symbol of the innate bond my mother and I share.As I sprinkled the basil onto the slightly charred onions, I grabbed a handful of green chilies and began finely chopping them. At that moment, it dawned on me that I had forgotten to show my mother the reason as to why I was fifteen minutes late. I ran back upstairs, dumped my knapsack onto my bed, and rummaged through its contents. Sufficiently out of breath, I returned to place fresh saffron on the countertop. My mother, having forgotten her glasses, held it close to her face as she examined the crimson red strings of the spice. Almost instantly, she began tearing up. With eyes watering, she looked at me and explained that growing up in the slums of Sri Lanka, she could only dream of affording such a luxury.At ten years old, my mother was tasked with the job of cooking meals for her entire family. She walked two miles in the scorching heat, wading through serpent-infested waters, to pick a handful of mallum (greens), five sardines, and two red chilies.Looking back on that night, I understand why my mother cried. I had always thought of her as an adult when in truth, she too is someone\\'s child. At some point in her life, she was also seventeen, but instead of applying to universities, her daily routine consisted of embarking on a treacherous journey to put food on the table. Her hard work and bravery are the reasons why I\\'ve been able to experience life as I have, and I aspire to develop my own sense of courage to one day match hers.Earlier last year, my aspiration was put to the test. My high school was rocked by several sexual assault cases, which left our student body divided. Someone had asserted that these issues stemmed from the fact that our administrators accepted minority children \\\\u2013like me\\\\u2014without \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018screening\\' properly. I tried to bite my tongue, but as I smelled my dress shirt, smelled the heritage of my mother and her resilience, I knew that something had to be said. So, I spoke out.I spoke for every student who felt threatened by the school culture that was rapidly growing more antagonistic towards them \\\\u2014who was suddenly self-conscious that they reeked of their ethnicity\\\\u2014and told them we were not the problem.The ability and ease my first world status brings is one that will no longer be taken for granted. My mother\\'s story will continue to linger in me throughout university and beyond, even after the hint of spices has left my cotton shirts. As I continue to cook on my own, I will continually be reminded of the love of my mother, the will of my parents, and my ability to use the bravery I derive from them to rise above any obstacles the future may bring.\"}, {\"index\": 203, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Describe a problem you\\'ve solved or a problem you\\'d like to solve.

We had spent the summer next to good \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018ol Lennox, a town with absolutely nothing to do. Living in this nothingness, we all focused on the truly valuable thing\\\\u2014each other. I can vividly recall the first recital, when person after person went up and performed. Justin, the never serious one, over-sentimentalized the last bars of his Chopin Ballade. Theo, the always serious one, surprised us with an unapologetically zany interpretation of Rachmaninoff. Ayane impressively improvised her way out of a memory slip to formulate a complex finale. We were not showing off for an audience; we were playing for each other\\\\u2014each, in turn, adding to the conversation amongst ourselves. And with every concert, masterclass, and outing, we grew to admire each other\\'s uniqueness and beauty, each adding our own ingredient to the magic of the Magnificent Seventeen. Today, we bid farewell to that magic.How could I possibly say goodbye to these irreplaceable people? For the first time in a long time, I felt as if I couldn\\'t genuinely express what I wanted to say. No amount of forensic talent could adequately tell them \\'I love you\\' and \\'I\\'ll miss you.\\' I wouldn\\'t simply love them or miss them\\\\u2014there was something beyond\\\\u2014something more that I so desperately wanted to express.The final concert consisted of pieces assigned to us by the professors, and while others had emotional, heartfelt pieces, I was stuck with Liszt\\'s light, fluffy, and carefree Valse-Impromptu. How desperately I wanted a Chopin Nocturne or a Brahms Intermezzo\\\\u2014something nostalgic and sad, something that could express my sorrow.The West Street Theater stage stared down at me in its impervious regality. Upon stepping up, looking at the beautiful faces of those I loved and likely wouldn\\'t see again, and knowing that this would be my last time with them, I let myself go.Perhaps a music critic would deem my performance distasteful, making comments about how Liszt intended it differently. They would likely prefer the piece to be lighter, quicker, zestier. But in that moment, in the silent hall filled with the people I had grown to love, with the memories that we had created, and with the moment itself becoming a memory as we lived it, all I wanted to do was sing. And sing I did. The happy and carefree passages of the Valse-Impromptu rang richer and deeper\\\\u2014evocative of our happier past memories; the dramatic, indulgent passages sang and sobbed sonorously for the present anguish. I had a vision of all of us smiling and laughing in the expansive meadow surrounded by the Berkshire forest, and I knew that they saw it too. But by the final page, I was back in the West Street Theatre. The final chords, guardedly hopeful, hinting of times in the future when we could all meet again. I was in tears. My put-together, professional persona: completely abandoned. I took my final bow, looked into the equally wet eyes of my beautiful, beautiful friends, and stood there in the moment. The dark stage resonated with approval, whispering words of comfort and warmth into my quivering body.

I, however, am obsessed with it \\\\u2013 not only because of its nostalgic taste but also because oddly, the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018king of fruit\\' and I share much in common.One day, when I was twelve and home alone, I caught a familiar whiff. Despite being cocooned in layers of red plastic, I still located the durian. I wanted it.Armed with a bread knife, I confronted the brutish fruit. As I resolutely hacked away at its spiky, enigma-like shell, I suddenly spotted star-like notches on the durian\\'s base. Aha! Using them as my guide, I cut lengthwise to remove the unsightly greenish membrane, revealing nutritious jewels of flesh inside. I had successfully pried my first durian open at the tender age of twelve. I ate every mouthful of creamy sweetness and bold tanginess with gusto. Ah, how gratifying it was to reap the fruit of my labor!When my parents came home, they were shocked to find their girl with durian oozing between her fingers, and bemused at how I \\\\u2013 a demure and slight girl \\\\u2013 had managed to best this \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018king of fruit\\' even they dared not challenge.I was never a David to the Goliath of durians.

I have since embraced my strength in listening to my peers.I eventually mustered the courage to try team sports for the first time. It came as a surprise to me, though, when I became an avid softball player in high school. I assumed that introverts were incompatible with team sports. However, I soon realized that team sports also require individual focus. I spent hours, alone, perfecting the precise movements of throwing the ball. Yet our team is driven by a collective spirit of \\'guts over fear\\'. On the field, we stealthily lock eyes, signaling to one another with the slightest nod. In this manner, a quiet synergy spreads across the field.My stoic exterior allows me, drenched in sweat, to bear the 100-degree heat and analyze the next play. And when my team celebrates a home run or dive catch, I am also the one who exudes sweet, enduring joy.I am more than just a quiet person, just as there is more to a durian than its prickly shell. Passionate about international politics, I advocate for justice. Intrigued by economics, I contentedly pore over books and seek to understand the societal forces at work.

Yet to my family and friends, I was always the ambitious girl who relentlessly experimented with new ideas whenever inspiration struck. While quiet, I have a gritty determination to accomplish tasks once I set my mind to it.In middle school, I walked into my first\\\\u00adever Model UN meeting. Initially, I doubted myself, but my timid voice gradually gave way to confidence. I embraced the thrill of combining ideas to voice my opinions compellingly, just as I had experimented with original flavors in my cooking. Surprisingly, I won a Most Improved Delegate award in my first year. My eyes opened to the world of intensely competitive MUN. I found my talent in debating, driven by my love for the art of rhetoric.Five years later, I still thrive amidst the intense dueling between opposing ideas.

As I tightly clutched my flimsy 1st place certificate, I felt like my efforts had been validated.For me, winning was exhilarating, but not enough \\\\u2014 I had to be better no matter what. My desire to constantly improve was almost compulsive. My high standards drove me to sports where I didn\\'t have to depend on teammates that could fail me: chess, tennis, and swimming. I even played basketball alone; I spent hours at a neighborhood hoop tirelessly working to sink as many consecutive three-pointers as I could. Every shot had to be perfect. But, I was a solo performer, and shouldering this enormous burden alone took a toll.In fifth grade, my love for science and fast-paced competitions led me to Science Bowl. But there was one caveat: I had teammates. Wary of working with others, I tried to become my own team, memorizing as much as I could about every subject. However, one question soon revealed the flaw in my approach: \\'Which of the following is true of the mantle?\\' Even though I wasn\\'t sure of the answer, I impulsively slammed down on the red button and guessed. Rather than let my teammates, who may have known the answer, buzz, I had to determine the outcome.My fatal buzz ended the match. Costing not only myself, but also my team, the competition felt horrible. I couldn\\'t actually master physics and chemistry and biology and astronomy by myself. Initially, I distanced myself entirely from Science Bowl; however, a few days later, I guiltily faced my teammates. The consequences of my individual failure made me realize that, to win, I had to work with others and trust my teammates.Science Bowl showed me that winning required teamwork, but I still saw collaboration as just a way to win.However, researching at a biomedical engineering and physics lab in my junior year completely transformed my perspective. My first few interactions with my fellow interns were cringeworthy, filled with awkward silences and meaningless pleasantries. However, one day, a supplies shortage forced us to devise our own experimental apparatus with my iPhone and a selfie-stick. I discovered something much greater than the scientific uses of selfie-sticks that week \\\\u2014 I discovered how much true collaboration matters. To celebrate our success, we trekked to \\'Speedy Street Tacos,\\' a nearbytaco stand that became our daily lunch spot. Discussing everything from our ideas for optimizing super-hydrophilicity to Makoyi\\'s (in)ability to woo women bridged our differences in age and experience. Once we became friends, our work was so much better, and we had fun doing it. We would have never succeeded as much as we did without our camaraderie. Ultimately, I\\'ve grown to embrace that life\\'s a circus \\\\u2014 a crazy show filled with failures and mistakes that make it uniquely mine. Despite what that second grade spelling bee champ thought, winning isn\\'t everything. Chatting at a roadside taco stand creates something greater than any certificate or win.

But there was one caveat: I had teammates. We all memorized as much as we could about every subject without communicating. However, our first tournament soon revealed the flaw in our approach: rather than deferring to other teammates, who were more knowledgeable on the topic, we all raced to slam down on the red button.This strategy cost us many matches and, initially, our team grew apart. However, a few days later, I guiltily called a team meeting. To win, we had to trust each other. As captain, I made study plans for my teammates, so that we could become specialists in our respective subjects and rely on each other to win. Science Bowl showed me that leaders can\\'t succeed on their own.

For the rest of the summer, I embraced my role as part of this new team by writing papers and grants, and leading the research and development on our microliter blood analysis technique called HemaDrop.My experiences in Science Bowl and research have transformed me from a leader who saw teamwork as a means to an end to someone who truly appreciates the value of working as a team. Every day, my new perspective on what it means to be a leader allows me to be a better researcher, team captain, and ultimately a student who can contribute meaningfully to his community.I view humor as one of my greatest talents -- not because I\\'m that hilarious, but because of how it connects me with others. I employ humor to build upon existing relationships and forge new ones. It is my way of bringing out the best in myself and others is through humor.Humor has even found its way into my Organic Chemistry class, where our primary language isn\\'t English or chemical nomenclature -- it\\'s nonsensical inside jokes. We chuckle at tert-butyl alkyl groups, even creating the substituent with our arms. Contrary to what you might think, these inside jokes do not hinder learning. Instead, they enhance it. For instance, when I\\'m taking a test and a \\'terty\\' butyl is attached to a cyclic alkene, all of the jokes we cracked flood my memory, and I can immediately identify the compound. \\'Boring\\' material becomes entertaining. My passion comes through when I explain concepts to my classmates or the younger children I tutor when I use amusing acronyms and mnemonics. Humor reminds me and those around me that work and fun aren\\'t mutually exclusive. And fun actually makes work a lot more effective. My jokes go beyond reinforcing learning. However superficial, they create moments that deepen my bonds with others. When I see a classmate after a tough day, we can always grin by making a tert-butyl with our arms. During junior year, I wanted to be able to expand that by writing a mock-advice column, entitled Yash-ip Girl (yup, a synthesis of my name and Gossip Girl), in our school newspaper. After a somewhat rocky start, my audience grew wider, and hilarious questions began filling up my inbox. Students and teachers alike still often stop me in the hallways by yelling my pseudonym and referencing some ridiculous line from the column (for instance, advice on \\'balling\\') that made them laugh. I love how humor allows people to bond over shared experiences and truly enjoy the work we do. I view humor as an essential part of myself, like a bone in my arm. Now isn\\'t that humerus?The two staples of our AP Physics C class were the deep baritone voice of our beloved teacher, Mr. Mac and a poster that read, \\'Formulas are for babies.\\' Before AP Physics C, I viewed physics as just another subject -- another class where I had to do some practice problems, read the textbook, and take tests. I enjoyed solving problems, but I studied superficially by memorizing solutions instead of understanding how to approach any problem. I developed my ability to actually solve problems instead of simply regurgitating solutions. And it was beautiful. AP Physics C taught me more than just mechanics, electricity, and magnetism, but how to study and approach everyday problems more meaningfully. Physics quickly became one my passions even outside of the classroom.Armed with my new appreciation, I joined my school\\'s Physics Club and prepared for the U.S. Physics Olympiad Exam, on which I earned semifinalist honors. Challenging myself every Tuesday to understand new, abstract concepts about Modern Physics and attempt difficult problems was liberating -- I reveled in the systematic approach I took to solve problems.My love for physics deepened when I started pursuing research as a junior. As I learned about Quantum Mechanics in the classroom, I saw the real life applications in the lab -- for instance, we had talked about using an ion beam to excite electrons, and I had the chance to work with a particle accelerator weekly! Along what I learned in my physics classes, my experiences in biomedical engineering research intricately related physics to biology, another one of my passions. In fact, the most interesting and complex physical system to understand is the human body. Whether it\\'s Bernoulli\\'s principle governing the flow of blood through the heart or mechanical stress determining the optimal composition of prosthetics, solving problems -- like microliter blood analysis -- at the intersection of physics and biology is extremely impactful and intellectually stimulating. Ultimately, physics has provided me with crucial problem-solving abilities that I use in all aspects of my life. I now aspire to solve problems at the intersection of biology and engineering with biomedical engineering.\"}, {\"index\": 208, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'A Brief History of Time\\'  It was a pleasant February morning when my Grade 6 science teacher, Ms. Anjali Tilak, entered the classroom and wrote those five words on the chalkboard. While I am usually not this dramatic, I think it is safe to say that those five words changed the course of my life.  Ms. Tilak smiled as she saw the cluelessness on our faces and explained to us that she was referring to Stephen Hawking\\'s bestseller about modern physics. It didn\\'t take me more than two minutes to ask her my paradigm- shifting question, \\'Who is this guy?\\'. To say that I was amazed after I learned about Professor Hawking\\'s existence is an understatement. A man suffering from Lou Gehrig\\'s disease who happens to be one of the most brilliant individuals alive is, for me, the closest thing to a superhero. After I got home that day, I found the book on my parents\\' bookshelf. I drowned myself in the mysterious world of black holes and quarks and quasars and a bunch of other big words that helped me look really cool in school. It was a world that I didn\\'t fully understand (quantum mechanics came off as particularly counter-intuitive), but it was a world that resonated with me.  Soon enough I found my eyes widening more and more every time anyone mentioned the words \\'physics\\', \\'quantum mechanics\\', \\'cosmology\\' or \\'chocolate\\' (who doesn\\'t love chocolate?). My Facebook and Twitter feeds starting filling up with physics related news, my YouTube feed started filling up with videos from the channel ASAP Science and my reading list started filling up with books like \\'Seven Brief Lessons on Physics\\' and \\'Surely You\\'re Joking Mr. Feynman!\\'. Debates about parallel universes with my friends became frequent instances in my life.I didn\\'t just stop there; I decided to get my hands dirty. I started taking part in quizzes, competitions, and research.I loved every moment that I spent working on my Physics Extended Essay on the mechanics of the double pendulum, especially the time when I found a way to increase the precision of my readings by 50 percent, yes, 50 percent! The Google Science Fair, a competition for which I worked incredibly hard to build a compact water filter but didn\\'t succeed, made me realize how much I enjoyed the process of trying to solve a problem through various logical approaches.  One of the most unforgettable moments in these last four years was when a judge at a science exhibition was so impressed with my team\\'s project, a glove that generates electricity through the difference in temperature between the skin and the environment, that he told us to \\'patent it\\'. We were so happy that after months of testing, failing and redesigning, our invention finally worked and it generated enough electricity to light up a 2 volt LED and impress a panel of judges. But the light from that tiny LED did more than that, it gave me a ray of hope and made me realize that I could do something with physics. I started dreaming about a future in physics, a future where I used my understanding of physics to help make humans an interplanetary species, to discover the secrets behind dark matter, and to do many other equally magical things.I guess I\\'ve always loved the idea of magic. I spent my early years reading the Harry Potter series and then turned to physics so that I could find magic in the real world, and physics did not disappoint. Physics has enabled humankind to build rockets, harness energy from the sun, and look at the building blocks of matter by smashing sub-atomic particles together at speeds close to the speed of light. If none of these things can be described as \\'magical\\', is there anything that can?\"}, {\"index\": 209, \"new_personal_statement\": \"6:57 A.M.

Maneuvering my frame through the densely packed car, I embark on my journey, my meticulous routine designed to help me escape the instability of my home. A familiar sight surrounds me: hurried men in tailored business suits circled by homeless nomads sleeping under the train\\'s inextinguishable fluorescent light. A family performs a string quartet, transforming the train car into Carnegie Hall and drawing both smiles and dangerous scowls from the audience. Prayers of the Torah captivate a young boy wearing a kippah. Next to him, an elderly Vietnamese couple indulges in a scrumptious dish of pho. With every stop the train makes further from home, I tighten my grip on authoritative control over my being. 8:43 A.M. In a flustered frenzy, I exit the train and flutter towards my first destination, using my designated path to reach the doorstep of my rhythmic gymnastics school. I calculate that I will have exactly seven minutes to roll away the carpets and wooden ballet barres at gymnastics and take the Q train to tutor on the other side of town. Every moment effortlessly falls into place onto the endlessly circulating conveyor belt of my existence. 7:16 P.M. Hopping on board the train once more, I find safety and refuge in mimicking the train conductor announcing the next stop and calculating time intervals between train stops. I revel in my routine, equating change with rampant destruction.9:30 P.M. Sliding through the rusted metal turnstile, I numbly direct my body towards the place where my routine holds no power: home. I pray that my key still fits the lock. I hope to find my things where I left them that morning and not scattered, destroyed, or discarded after one of my mother\\'s torturous scavenger hunts. My mother\\'s abuse inflicts more than just physical pain. It disrupts my routine and, therefore, my sanity. My home is the epicenter of instability. Its tensions confine me to a world of vulnerability and uncertainty, of restraints that I cannot ever imagine being liberated from. My routine, embodied by my time on the train, comforts and shelters me from the otherwise unbearable fluctuations permeating my life.Now, I learn to make a routine of new endeavors and experiences, accepting the ever-changing nature of my world. Habit and routine have no say in my pattern of living. I resist the structure that once consumed me. No longer hiding behind the confines of monotony, I free my creative spirit and fill my world with spontaneity. The admirable beauty of my conventional train ride lies not in its static image but its continual evolution and journey forward. In defiance of all constraints imposed by my mother, I fearlessly progress into a world of uncertainty, unraveling the tight grip once held on my existence. Like my train rides, I am set abound by possibility. I am eternally dynamic. I refuse stability and ambitiously venture toward unfamiliar territory.\"}, {\"index\": 210, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The piano plays a blues-like arpeggio, pentatonic notes ascending until G#7. My fellow choir members and I begin to sing our second song, \\'Music Down in my Soul,\\' for the spiritual category in the Golden Gate International Choir Festival. The piano dramatizes its notes over the line \\'Over my head\\' as we slowly bring our hands mid-body to groove. Suddenly, the piano accelerates into an upbeat gospel and we cry, \\'I got this music down in my soul! And it feels my heart with the joy of the Lord!\\' In our red pouf dresses (and one \\'waiter\\' boy), we sway vigorously, like palm trees in a windy March afternoon in LA. Our swelling hearts revealed jubilation through our dynamic melodies, huge smiles, and dancing bodies. I myself felt a fire spread throughout my body that impelled me to perform dramatically. \\'Music Down in my Soul\\' elevated my understanding of African-American trauma during the time of Southern slavery; the emotional gestures highlight my connection to the historical community. When we sang \\'Over my head, I hear music in the air,\\' I understood the analogy between God and music; through God, African-American slaves believed they were free, and music, at this point, was their only salvation. They reaffirm this point again with \\'There must be a God somewhere/Over my head, I feel singing in the air.\\' Choral music thus exposes me to personal and global stories and links me to another person or community intuitively, fortifying my empathy for humanity. Choir taught me that storytelling illuminates universal truths. These truths reveal the nuances of human experience from grief to love. Personal stories of injustice especially aggravate me; the obstructions due to power and prejudice placed on the marginalized prevents them from simply living. When I first read \\'Emily Doe\\'s\\' testimony, I was angry. I was disappointed by the judge\\'s partiality to Brock Turner, who had clearly violated \\'Emily Doe\\'; disappointed by the judge\\'s inability to sympathize with her trauma, and most of all, disappointed by the justice system\\'s failure to protect the victim, the person that the system had promised to protect. Driven by my sense of unfairness in \\'Emily Doe\\'s\\' situation, I raised awareness on sexual violence in my local community by leading discussions about sexual violence through a club on my high school campus, Amnesty International, and fundraising for Thorn, a nonprofit that fights sex trafficking through technology. In doing so, I hope to prevent people falling victim to sexual violence, and fight for the liberation of those who are victims. Through understanding universal revelations in stories, I am motivated to fight for the betterment of humanity\\'s conditions.Of course, I advocate for myself and my many identities. I am part of many communities with their own unique stories. I am a Filipino American, an ethnic minority with stories of colonization and discrimination in its collective psyche. I am a member of the LGBT community where stories of repression of true love and true expression endure in the fight for visibility. I am a Gen Zer, an emerging generation with humorous relatable stories and a readiness to defend the future. I am a poet, a construer of language the discloses my letter to the world. I am a scholar, one who observes the stories of the world to discern their wisdom for the future. Beyond all, I am a citizen of the world whose connection with innumerable peoples propels me to be in emotional unity with unknown narratives. Without my choral experiences, I would have never arrived to the conclusion of storytelling as testimony to truth. Songs of different traditions and travels to foreign places to sing with choirs around the world only strengthen my argument. Because of choir, I am an activist motivated by others\\' stories to campaign for justice.Immaculate Heart of Mary Children\\'s Choir has been my second family since 4th grade. My choral director Mr. A jokingly once said that I sounded like a \\'roach\\' at first. Yet, he saw my potential for growth and permitted me to join the choir\\'s rich history. I was first a Soprano 2 weakling who competed in the World Choir Games and won two silver medals in the children\\'s choir and spiritual categories. The next year I traveled to Eugene, Oregon to sing at the Pacific International Children\\'s Choir Festival. The festival\\'s choral director Mr. Henry Leck taught me singing techniques that metamorphized me from a roach to a butterfly. After, Mr. A moved me to alto 2. Because of my powerful heavy voice, I became a leading figure in the group, being responsible for knowing the alto parts and mentoring younger newcomers.As an alto, I became important in numerous choral events. In 2015, the choir competed at the Golden Gate Festival wherein the group placed 3rd in the African-American spiritual category. In 2016, we sang at the National Children\\'s Choir Festival at Carnegie Hall. Though an elementary school choir, I still was a part of it despite graduating from middle school. In high school, we maintained some choral traditions like singing at the LA County Fair every Christmas Eve and at Disney CA Adventure. We also sang at a Bishops awards ceremony and opened for a new Filipino choir at Walt Disney Hall. Recently the choir sang at Canterbury Cathedral in England for the International Children\\'s Choir Festival. In all events, my alto voice held the three-part harmonies together and assured that the pitch was still correct. Instead of being a \\'roach,\\' I was the choir\\'s anchor because of my ability to lead other choral members to succeed in performance with my thunderous singing.My dedication to my choir has led to me achieving a top role within the group. Because of this role, I have strengthened the choir\\'s reputation. I thus have achieved excellence and self-fulfillment. Now, I am ready to utilize my initiative as a future leader.\\'I exist explosively for phenomena of the world and of humans,The need to extinguish flames with pages and lessonAll leading to personal investigations\\'I express myself through poetry, the art of condensing language into lines and symbols.

This time it was different \\\\u2014 I had accidentally broken dozens of dishes before, but this was my Grandma\\'s favorite mug.Alarmed by the sound, she rushed over to the kitchen and found me stationary, with liquid soap dripping down my fingers, and staring down at the shards that once constituted her favorite mug. I stared at her face and could see the disappointment written all over it. I was only a 7-year-old but I could tell I had messed up. She remained mute, though, holding in her frustration, and walked away slowly.Growing up in Fadeyi, Lagos, ceramic plates were a luxury we could not afford to have, and the few we were fortunate to,we could not afford to lose.Normally, after the deed was done the shattered pieces would be disposed of immediately. It saddened me to see such luxury go to waste. So, pensively, I devised a solution \\\\u2014 intercept the pieces\\' journey to the waste bin and make something out of them. To prevent my Grandma from finding out, I hid the pieces in a plastic bag and took them to my friend Chuka\\'s house. He accepted the responsibility of hiding the bag and I assured him that I would come up with a plan we would execute over the weekend.The day came and I suggested that we tried making art collages with the assorted pieces \\\\u2013 we had gathered together ceramics of different colors, sizes, and thickness. Initially, the idea was absurd to both Chuka and I; I had no former experience with visual arts and neither did he. In addition, we had to keep our artwork hidden so as to avoid chastisement from our parents whom we knew would not grant us permission to handle such \\'dangerous objects\\'. We dared, still. \\'A smiley face, Chuka!\\' I yelled; \\'Let\\'s make a smiley face\\'. Armed with a wooden board, a gooey adhesive mixture, a bucket loaded with mud, and the focus of art aficionados, we began working on our first project. One by one, we filled the dents in the ceramic fragments with the mud, and then glued the flat surfaces to the board. As we repeated these steps, I felt so proud that my idea was starting to come to fruition and maybe, after all, breaking those dishes was not so bad.We went on to finish the smiley face just before sunset. It was nowhere near perfect, but hey, what is?Later that day, I latched onto a rather obtrusive yet eye-opening truth \\\\u2014 those seemingly effete shards of earthenware had now been made utile. By taking those deconstructed pieces and reconstructing them, we had made art. In a bid to replicate the thrills I got from that experience, I began engaging in Literature. I found parallels in the way one could take words made up of different letters, possessing different meanings, and merge them into a peculiar story. This was my \\'Eureka!\\' moment. I would go as far as randomly selecting different letters and making a word out of each letter to form a coherent sentence. This means that, according to me, the incomprehensible word at the beginning of this essay could also abbreviate \\'I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine\\' or \\'I wouldn\\'t buy others; they\\'re clearly old for me\\'.  Pondering that experience now, I notice a resemblance with today\\'s society: everyone is a piece of earthenwarebroken from a much larger piece,each with a different purpose, shade of color, and size, yet all working together to birth a new masterpiece. Now, I strive to replicate this experience in college \\\\u2014 both as the artist himself, transforming others\\' lives, and as a broken piece, letting others transform mine.\"}, {\"index\": 212, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Nine hundred and ninety nine billion, nine hundred and ninety nine million, nine hundred and ninety nine thousand,nine hundred and ninety nine plus nine hundred and ninety nine billion, nine hundred and ninety nine million, ninehundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine equals\\\\u2026..I look up disturbed by the noise of avehicle engine only to see my school van approaching, distinct because of the cloud of dark fumes from itsexhaust trailing it. I furrow my eyebrows knowing I have to continue tomorrow but smile again as I realize the frontseat is empty.

I had a small notebook where I jotted down the endless numbers, soon after learning about them. Devoted,I would stand by the street in the morning waiting for the school van as I performed my complex calculations. Afew weeks later, I realized I was looking for something \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018abstract\\'- infinity, or at least that was what I was told. Everytime I recall this, I smile. The amused feeling comes and goes but one question remains. Is there really infinity?Man decided to label that which he cannot reach: that which he cannot seem to comprehend. Because there wasno limit, we created our own limit and called it infinity. We masked this with a simple definition: impossible tocount- never to be attained. It\\'s our nature to try to make concepts more logical since such \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018maximums\\' are theunderlying features of our society. There are things you just can\\'t do, they say. Why? Because it\\'s impossible.Why is it impossible? Because there\\'s a limit to everything.Is there?Grounded on such \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018rules\\' for as long as I can remember, I couldn\\'t possibly imagine straying from pre-determinedpaths. Crushing any fantasies of deviation, I explored what was expected of me. After all, I was staying within thelimits since anything drastically different should not be attained. I had a perfect plan and expected it to dictate mylife. Work hard. Pass my finals. Get into medical school- a seemingly sole desire in my society. Be a successfuldoctor. Make everyone happy. Nothing could go wrong in my plan right?Right.Then I joined Secondary school. Exposed to so many things that I would have otherwise overlooked, I began toquestion the viability of \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018limits\\'. My interests started to grow and my bubble formed lines of weakness. I dared tostay at the music room occasionally; the pull too strong to ignore. I dared to believe I could change the countrywith my new interest in waste management. The unusual attraction to music and science drew me in- a uniondefying infinity. Gradually, infinity became less abstract. Something that wasn\\'t expected to be attained becamedefined.When I started to play the drums, a foreign sense of tranquility and belonging overcame me. Indeed, musicopened the cork that had previously locked in my ambitions. I was no longer scared of a heart I couldn\\'t silence. Aheart filled with as many fears as ambitions that longed to be set free. For in reality, infinity diminishes the abyss ofuncertainty by falsely assuring you of a point where things are impossible. Music made my infinity more tangibleand borders non-existent. It made me get in touch with my inner child and finally, I resumed my challenge- Icontinued in search of a concrete type of infinity. An infinity where I dream of the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018impossible\\'- never to be attained;a dream where I can make a difference. In the midst of trillions, billions, millions, thousands and hundreds, there\\'sa central equation: music plus science equals discredited infinity.\"}, {\"index\": 213, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I first visited Tibet for the Sho Dun Festival. Dozens of brawny lamas carried an enormous painting of Buddha and hung it on the hillside for local believers of all ages dressed in traditional Tibetan clothes to pay tribute. I learned from a local that this piece of art is called Tangka. The Tangka had cast a spell so strange and strong on me that day that I found myself journeying to inner Tibet for three consecutive summers, despite ongoing sensitive geopolitical issues within China.During my first visit, I saw countless breathtaking Tangkas and met the monks who made them. I learned that Tangka symbolizes and embodies the grace of heaven and is itself worshiped as joss, a representation of the Buddha. One monk welcomed me into his workspace. The Tangkas that adorned his walls had existed for more than three-hundred years, yet the colors were vibrant like they were painted recently. Ten to twenty small stone saucers on the floor were filled with red coral, gold, and obsidian powder. These elements were mixed with human saliva and Yak bile. Surrounded by the saucers, the monk sat reading the scriptures. I couldn\\'t understand what the Tibetan monk said, but I almost cried, because I felt the prosperity and depression of Buddhism.I wanted to read and understand Tangkas, so I decided to learn Tibetan. For a year, I watched Tibetan multimedia, and read Tibetan Buddhist history. The complex Tibetan alphabet was dazzling: thirty letters\\' pronunciations sounded like tongue twisters. I was like a babbling baby, yearning to master Tibetan.In 2015, in pursuit of my new passion, I volunteered in the Tibet Tangka Fair. Tibet is 3800 meters altitude above sea level. At this height, breathing was difficult and altitude sickness plagued me. Eighteen hours a day of backbreaking work, helping the Tangka monks move the heavy Tangkas and translating texts were balanced by constant discussions. The physical pain mixed with mental awe, and, in that state of grace, I completely experienced what I had only minimally observed before. Tibet exists at the intersection of great pain and spiritual intensity.Tibet called to me for a third time. I volunteered with a Red Cross medical support team, and was honored to attend a Buddhist burial ritual. Tibetans believe that when the vessel of the body has been devoured, only then is the spirit free to move into the next karmic cycle. It was unlike anything I had ever experienced. A group of people dressed in traditional garb put the body in the field while reciting scriptures. The body was covered by white hada and put into the fetal position. The priest in red recited the scriptures while using a sharp black knife to dismember the body. He piped \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018awhhh\\', and the sky was blackened by a kettle of vultures that suddenly dived to devour the body. And after thirty minutes, nothing remained but white bones. I watched the priest quickly smash the remains and mix the powder with barley into a soft white ball. The vultures ate all and nothing was left. In that moment, I realized how fragile humans are. Once again, I was struck by the feeling of pain and awe, the destruction and creation unique in this fearless faith.I learned about the culture and history of Tibet especially Tangkas, and at the same time, I discovered much about myself. Before Tibet, I experienced the world by thinking instead of by feeling or acting. The art of Tangka taught me that profound feeling is profound living. I learned that destruction and creation, pain and awe, history and art are the lenses through which to see the world. Now, I want to dedicate myself to studying the intersections of art, religion, and history and one day return to Tibet to continue learning life\\'s greatest lessons.There\\'s a certain magic to learning language, finding out the combination and grammar rules, putting stokes together to complete the vocabularies and sentences, then communicate with others. Making friends and using language are always full of expectation.My fate with language begun with the teenage age\\'s curiosity and the belonging of \\'hipster\\'. In my 5th or 6th grade, there was one hot website focus, \\'The Japanese history book had changed a part of the World War II the period that China was occupied by Japan was removed\\'. As a girl who always argue with teacher. Trying to figure out whether this is true or not r, I begun to learn Japanese. Because the only way to solve this puzzle, it\\'s to learn this language and read the textbook myself.My playground was a jumble of video, tv series and cartoon books. I spent hours a day to try to mimic the tone and the rule of pronunciation and words\\' combination. My mother, noticed my intellectual curiosity and encouraged my childhood explorations. She gave me opportunities to attend summer camp in Japan to communicate with Japanese students and travel the country to feel and practice my language skill.As I learned more about Japanese and found the truth and reason behind that focus. I fell in love with language learning and try to learn more languages and use them properly. I\\'ve continued to learn Korean and Spanish. I joined a Earthquake helping organization, every time, when there\\'s earthquake happened, we would translate the important informations and sent them to rescue team. For example, the Kumamoto had earthquake of magnitude 7.3 in 2016. After seeing the news, we went to the gov website to translate the basic state of the earthquake, we went to check the centrum\\'s ground traffic condition to inform the rescue team which road to go, and sorted the materials local people need.

You are being a bad person.\\'I gave the woman to my right, this kid\\'s mom, a look which she returned with a meek, apologetic smile. While I was trying my best to ignore this child, I was also reading a very philosophical teen romance book and had just come across these lines: \\'Look around. All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.\\' Upon reading that quote I looked more carefully at the pair on either side of me, heart racing, and I noticed the mother looked worn; her beauty was marked with dark circles around her eyes and choppy, unkempt, hay-colored hair.\\'I know how you feel,\\' she whispered to me, \\'Don\\'t worry, we\\'re getting off at the next stop.\\'I suddenly realized the reason behind the child\\'s behavior. I felt ashamed and selfish, and that very \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018core value\\' I repeated in my expensive private school every week, empathy, was lost to me. Feeling a mix of embarrassment and pity, I quickly turned back to my book, sucking the cold air out of my cup. I took this bus route often enough. I happened to know the next stop was the Vancouver Autism Clinic.They say our eyes are equivalent to 480-megapixel cameras. The idea that a simple organ can have such a pivotal influence on us is extraordinary to me. What is more remarkable, though, is that if we aren\\'t genuinely looking, we miss out on more than just 480-megapixel pictures. We miss out on life itself. Sure, athletics and academics are important, but the ability to empathize with others, to create meaningful relationships and mutual understanding of another human being\\'s situation, constitutes a fulfilling life. This duo, as you may guess, was one of those 480-megapixel pictures that I will never forget. This mother, with her infinite patience, cared for her autistic child and even apologized to me, but I had not even been able to look beyond myself to put myself in her shoes for a moment. Looking at this child, I couldn\\'t help but think of my own brother who struggled with illness. Most importantly, I found the mother\\'s resiliency and unrelenting love for her son were qualities I could carry into my life. Since that 480-megapixel picture, my connections with my family members, especially my brother, have grown. Moreso now than before, I am more accepting of them regardless of our differences and I try to be conscious in our interactions to show more empathy. Previously, where there was an underlying tension in our household, there is peace and acceptance.Those lines from Shatter Me helped me realize just how vital it is to see others for who they truly are. Whether those people are close friends or individuals I have just encountered, they have their own diverse experiences, insights, and perspectives that I can learn from. The concept of reaching out to connect, physically and literally, is not a new one. However, in a world of iPhone pictures and social media, where the world seems to be more connected than it ever has been before, the wisdom of this quote reminded me that the images around us, the ones that we see with our eyes, are the most important ones.In today\\'s society, there is a commonly held belief that when you\\'re living with people who do not agree with you, you do not need to maintain factual discussion, instead whatever abstraction that you and your community believe is considered right. If everyone agrees without question, discourse that leads to the synthesis of potentially conflicting ideologies does not exist. If others follow blindly, with no one challenging the established status quo, there is no growth of ideas within that realm. Compassion arises from the acts of sympathy, pity, and concern for the suffering of others, and without any challenge to dogmatic idealism, those who suffer are merely viewed as weak. Most importantly, for democratic societies to function efficiently, it is essential for open-mindedness to become a personal habit, especially when confronting those with whom we disagree. These three tenants form the noble art of disagreement. In this case of the jurors, the ideal reason for disagreement is not based on a misunderstanding, as the jurors would have had unbiased information about the topic at hand. On the contrary, I would argue that if the one juror rises against the status quo from perfect comprehension, from having chewed over the information and ideas of her peers so thoroughly that she could adequately form a rebuttal, she should be respected and justice should be upheld. From the perspective of the noble art of disagreement, to be one juror out of twelve who votes innocent, one has to first understand well before disagreeing well. For the juror to have opposed, she would have had to read deeply, listen carefully, and allow for the possibility that she might be persuaded by what her fellow jurors had to say.  She should be granted the right to her beliefs, and given the opportunity to express them in an open forum for justice, which is only as good as the foundation of the synthesis between opposing views it can build.              In the case of scientific and religious communities, how they handle conflict is not all that different from one another. To establish synthesis through the noble art of disagreement, it is mandatory for various communities to recognize their similarities and differences, for them to empathize. On the one hand, the two communities are very different. Science is a way of thinking, investigating and testing the nature of well, nature. It understands the material world and examines it to break down and explain new things. Religion, however, relies on the qualitative criteria of faith. Science thrives on a thirst for knowledge and continual destruction of theories and of the material world to create new theories and materials. In opposition, religion understands that the progression of materialistic temptations will lead to the breakdown of humanity. As Galileo puts it: \\'The Bible shows how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.\\' On the other hand, the two are very similar. One commonly underappreciated fact is that scholars from different religions typically come together to debate to establish the most truthful version of their faith, not unusual at all from how scientists gather to argue their theories. Furthermore, through their differences, one can see that the two complement one another: religion explains what science cannot by explaining what cannot be quantified. Science and religion are not to be seen as opposing ends of a spectrum; instead, they should be seen as intertwined strands held together, sometimes closer by the similarities of logic, critical thinking, and justice, and sometimes further apart by the differences of perspective, morality, and conclusion. Understanding this, one can see the importance of empathy, because by recognizing, accepting, and contrasting a belief that is not of their own, one can synthesize through empathy and employ the noble art of disagreement.             The beauty of discussion, rational discussion, is that it allows one to see and learn from both sides of an argument.  If one can see the ends: justice, empathy, and compassion, which are the noblest traits of agreement, then one can fully understand the necessity for the noble art of disagreement.  But, if the only reason for conflict is personal gain, then it is not disagreement at all but merely self-promotion. Mill said it best when he stated the all are entitled to freedoms, thought, speech, and action, but only if those did not infringe upon the rights of others. In each case, unless there is open discourse resulting in a synthesis of ideas, there is no freedom.  Justice, empathy, and compassion are the foundations of nobility; without them, we only disagree. To solely oppose for the sake of disagreement only creates conflict which lacks any and all traits of nobility.\"}, {\"index\": 215, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I\\'m a freak about ear plugs.

I already knew my name was different, but I had no idea why the kids were chanting it. What could smoking a cigarette possibly have to do with me?Inside the bus, I was startled by a girl waving her cell phone in my face. When she handed me the phone with \\'reefa\\' typed into the Urban Dictionary search bar, everything suddenly clicked.  Reefa: Another name for marijuana. Like weed.  \\'That\\'s not how you spell my name,\\' I cried, devastated by the contents of the screen.\\'Same difference,\\' she snickered.  I grew up with my mom telling me that my name meant \\'highness\\', blissfully unaware of the fact that it was actually slang for a commonly used drug. After my realization, I developed a certain sense of self-consciousness that surfaced whenever I met new people. Did they know what my name meant? Were they going to start making smoking gestures like the kids on the bus? As I got older, introductions were not as juvenile as they were in my elementary years, but my cheeks still flushed whenever people recognized the slang definition of my name.Every knowing grin, sly comment, and incorrect pronunciation reminded me of one thing: no matter how \\'American\\' my accent sounded or clothes looked, I was not one. Rifah is the Arabic word for highness, elevation, and dignity, but it means the complete opposite in English. Determined to dissociate from my culture, I naively decided that I was going to change my name.For the next few birthdays, I blew out the candles and requested a speedy route to turning eighteen. Under Illinois law, I could legally change my name at age eighteen. I fantasized about how easy life would be with the name Victoria and decided to transform myself into her. To me, Victoria represented poise and perfection. I carefully monitored what I wore, stopped eating with my hands at home, and made sure to never sit without crossing my legs. I thought that by changing my mannerisms, I could compensate for the fact that I had a different cultural background.The harder I tried to be Victoria, the more miserable I felt. I was chasing after an identity that I could never fully assume and restricting myself from doing the things that made me happy. I loved dressing up in traditional Bengali clothes, eating rice for every meal, and not over analyzing my every move in fear of judgment\\\\u2014but being Victoria meant that I had to give all of that up.As the years have passed, the number of times I have been mocked for my name has increased tenfold; however, each encounter affects me less. The people who attempt to demean me for my name have been outnumbered by the people who think it is extremely cool. Serving as an icebreaker, my name no longer has the power to make me cower in fear whenever I meet new people. In fact, I might even be the first to point it out.  With time, I have acquired the ability to laugh at myself and not take life too seriously. Maybe Victoria embodies poise and perfection, but Rifah loves laughing like there is nobody watching, eating spicy food with her hands, and singing Bengali songs at the top of her lungs.As my eighteenth birthday approaches, I am looking forward to the idea of leaving Victoria behind with the rest of my childhood.\"}, {\"index\": 217, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Firefly\\'You look like a fried rat.\\'I had only started the fourth grade and those were the first words spoken to me\\\\u2014yet, despite being friendless and insulted in less than ten minutes, those were the first words Shawna ever said to me. Now, most would proceed to never talk to her again, fearing the possibility of being harassed again but not me! I went on to disparage her in every possible way; I soon realized my mistake as a fist cratered itself firmly in my stomach. The following moments proved far too violent to describe. The aftermath left us stationed in a small table to sort our differences; we baulked, however, at the thought of talking to each other and turned our chairs to see something much more interesting than the other\\\\u2014a wall. After what seemed like years of silence, an ill-disposed pair of greetings lead to a unique revelation: we both came from Belize, a country whose small stature and lack of any real importance to the U.S proved difficult when finding someone who acknowledged its existence, much less a fellow Belizean. It\\'s fair to say this simple fact, the place we called home, was the key to forging a bond that would last ages. Maybe it was because we were both from a place nobody acknowledged, and this manifested itself as something integral to our very identity. We were misunderstood and lacked any real friends; we were outcasts whose existence was a nuisance at most. But, now! Now, we had each other.It didn\\'t take us long to become inseparable. Soon, it became predictable as to who I was eating lunch with or passing by the weekends with. Anything and everything, from every joke to every rooftop sleepover, it was always Shawna. As the years passed, we began meeting in a desolate house at the end of the road, climbing the ridiculously high roof (or maybe we were just short), to gaze at the radiant stars overhead as the moon took center stage. There was nothing we loved more than watching the opulence of stars, and it was during these moments that we picked a star, a lone star\\\\u2014a firefly in the sky\\\\u2014that refused to dissipate as the morning\\'s celestial giant took its position, however, this wasn\\'t the only thing she picked. At sometime, unbeknownst to me, she began to use Tar (impure heroin), something I vehemently opposed, but I was unable to remove the parasitic addiction growing inside her. After innumerable fights I gave up\\\\u2014I was useless. Then, the day before Thanksgiving 2014, she overdosed. She passed away shortly after.I tried to deny her death. I couldn\\'t bring myself to admit she was gone, but soon I found myself thinking \\'It\\'s my fault, it\\'s my fault, it\\'s my fault, it\\'s my...\\' and I remained in this cycle for months to come, until I brought myself to look up again.Her death resulted in the greatest upheaval I\\'ve ever faced, replanting habits I had spent years cultivating. I grew a certain delight in waking up before the hum of the city to stare at our star. I grew a determination to work hard, to spearhead my way through life, to get what I wanted because life was an ever changing sea of possibility. I grew dedicated to living for two people at once. To this day, I still visit the same lonely house to watch the resilient star we grew fond of.

Throughout my life, I have been involved with a multitude of extracurricular activities, including competitive sports, school band, and community service groups, but the activity that has transformed me the most and that I\\'m the most passionate about is my involvement withScouting, in both Brazil and the United States. I beganScoutingin the first grade, and eleven years later, I was awarded the highest rank within the Brazilian scouting movement, marking the zenith of myScoutingcareer and the most prestigious achievement in my lifesofar.When the members of the board congratulated me, and told me they decided that I had accomplished all the requirements of the rank and passed their review, I felt a strange feeling. I wasn\\'t relieved, surprised, or excited. It was then that I realized that the rank and title ofEscoteirodaP\\\\u00e0triameant far less to me than the path that I took to getthere.That night I went home and, lying in bed, I remembered learning how to smooth a block of wood with sandpaper during my first attempt to make a soapbox car for the Pinewood Derby. I remembered my reaction when my parents said we were moving to Brazil and not being able to speak Portuguese at my first scout meeting there. I remembered undercooking hamburgers and burning marshmallows on multiple camping trips. I remembered carrying members of my patrol who fainted during a grueling cave adventure. These are the moments that matter to me; these helped me gain knowledge, patience, and maturity. I remembered the challenge of leading younger scouts during my final project. I relived the restless nights before the start of the project, second-guessing my measurements, concerned that I might blow the budget. I recalled teaching younger scouts how to correctly use a saw so that they wouldn\\'t hurt themselves or others. I remembered presenting the finished project to the scout group\\'s leaders, and howthey were relieved to know that they finally had a sustainable and long-lasting waste management system that would serve the community for years to come.It was this project, and times like it, that demanded every ounce of my patience, experience, and leadership capabilities, that transformed me into the best man I can be. I now realize thatmy identity had been developed long before I stood in that quiet room. Yet, that is the only tangible date able to mark the transformation I\\'ve experienced. It is the date that changed my identity in the eyes of others forever. However, far more important than that one date, are the experiences leading up to it. The years, the tears, the sweat, the pain, and the terrain I\\'ve crossed through Scouting are what have transformed me into the young adult I am today. Although each individual experience on its own only offers a single lesson that I have learned, the culmination of those experiences and lessonsarewhat define who I am today.\"}, {\"index\": 219, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Quiet, submissive, unopinionated\\\\u2014these are sundry deep-rooted stereotypes for Asian women in American society. Nothing about me has ever fit this description. In my childhood, I thrived on hamburgers, screaming contests, and stubborn quarrels defending my opinion. I never considered race, gender, or any outward differences between those with whom I interacted. Yet, as I grew up, I noticed and soon loathed my peers\\' labels for Asian girls like me: weird, geeky, shy. Refusing to be shepherded into such boxes due to my appearance, I disassociated myself from my eventually ostracized culture. I was determined to be one of the white kids\\\\u2014the \\'normal\\' kids.However, my worldview changed the summer of 2014. The shooting of Michael Brown and the following Ferguson riots gave me an unfiltered view into race dynamics in America. The library, in which I had once innocently flipped through self-help books, now became a safe haven to contemplate social justice. I devoured poems by Audre Lorde on race politics and works by Loretta Lees on gentrification in major cities. In my community, I searched for and tuned into conversations on microaggressions, disproportionate judicial penalties, and white feminism. In one of her poetry anthologies, Lorde wrote, \\'It is not our differences that divide us. It is our inability to recognize, accept, and celebrate those differences.\\' I understood, then, that my evasion of Chinese culture stemmed from my peers\\' as well as my own inability to appreciate the unique aspects of my heritage. I also recognized that if I hadn\\'t been enlightened to discussions on identity, I would have continued to reject my culture.So, I created a club at my high school, Social Justice on Campus, to give greater visibility to these conversations. I lead weekly meetings to discuss various issues with topics ranging from the Mizzou/Yale protests to the connotations of \\'political correctness.\\' Aside from just deliberating during meetings, club members often take action after witnessing palpable issues within the community that called for it. After the horrific Orlando shooting, students at Lexington High chose to focus solely on the event\\'s ties to terrorism and its role in the growth of ISIL. With approval from the administration, other club members and I anonymously drew a mural in the center of the school reading, \\'LGBTQ+ Community, we love you and we want you here at LHS.\\' The dialogue shifted.The summer following my junior year, I interned at The Welcome Project, a nonprofit aimed at empowering immigrants. With the organization, I coordinated a summer program for kids focused on exploring their diverse identities. Surprisingly, I learned just as much from the children as they learned from me. I had once naively believed that I would not relate well to the Latino community due to my contrasting cultural upbringing. However, after spending time with the children and their families, I realized that I didn\\'t have to be from the same culture in order to join Latinos in celebrating the joy of life; Lorde\\'s words rang true that summer.As I continue to engage with and learn from various social movements taking place in the country, I become increasingly impassioned to be a part in bringing about lasting, positive change. Having been previously consumed by internalized racism particularly motivates me to work towards public policy that supports broader early education on race, gender, sexuality, and other forms of identity. Among the many new things I\\'ve encountered in the past few years, I\\'ve learned especially that the most crucial elements to emotional survival are conversation, encouragement, empathy, and trust. To break the social barriers in our society, to fight for people whether they look, speak, or act differently is the road this nation needs to achieve tolerance. We\\'ve come so far in furnishing justice within American society, and I cannot wait to undertake my own future work in accompanying this mounting motion to promote equality for all.\"}, {\"index\": 220, \"new_personal_statement\": \"As I stepped out onto the dirt track in borrowed, black cowgirl boots, I felt like a fraud. An unfamiliarly heavy pendant bounced on my chest as I shuffled in front of two decorated horses whose equallyadorned riders proudly gripped flags atop their steeds. I clutched the microphone in my clammy hand, clinging to my one comfort in the enormous, foreign stadium. I glanced up at the Jumbotron and I could see the back of a girl with pageant-worthy hair walking towards the center of the track. At first I thought it was a mere coincidence that we shared this same feature, but it soon dawned on me that the girl was me. I took my place in front of four military officers whose postures were stiff as pokers. As I centered myself in the track. I looked out to the crowd where thousands of Stetson hats gleamed in a sea of heads.

Sometimes people ask me, \\'So where did you get your singing ability?\\' Truth is, my \\'ability\\' is self-taught, from watching Disney movies and YouTube videos. Following my cue, I took a deep breath, and opened my mouth. The words of our country\\'s National Anthem tumbled from my lips; the lyrics were second nature to me after endlessly practicing the song in the shower, in the car, and in my head. I searched the crowd for the faces of my friends and family, who looked at me with anxious yet encouraging expressions.Before I had walked out onto the track, I reminded myself why I auditioned to sing in the first place. I hadn\\'t tried out two years in a row for a gig only to be miserable while I performed. It was an opportunity of a lifetime, so I better enjoy it.Once I conquered the first few verses of the anthem, my nerves disappeared. A smile spread across my face. I relished my moment in the spotlight, and floated the high note of the song. The crowd started to cheer as I began the last verse.Despite my nervousness before the performance, I realized in that moment my passion to perform trumped all other feelings. I am usually modest about my achievements or talents, but singing is an exception. The time I stand in the limelight is a time when I can let my guard down.

There, an observant nurse and an incredulous doctor discovered an anomaly.It was freshman year of high school, and my body was going to kill me.After noticing an irregularity in my blood pressure, the nurse informed the physician, who in turn discovered a heart murmur.

However, although my physical body had surpassed the crisis, many other aspects of my life had been affected. Everything used to come to me with ease: I was a high school freshman excelling in senior courses, at the top of my class, and was able to play varsity basketball after my freshman year at a Division 1 school. I was, being driven by an egotistical personality, able to eat, play, and do as I please. My diagnosis changed all that. I missed several weeks of classes visiting countless cardiologists and surgeons. I struggled to keep up with school work. My coach made the hurtful but logical decision to take me off the roster, convinced that I wouldn\\'t be able to play at such a competitive level in the upcoming season. For the first time in my life, I experienced tremendous failure.It was freshman year of high school, and I had given up.Absolutely defeated by such a novel experience, the days preceding the surgery were riddled with silent self-pity.The surgery, upon completion, became the object of my hatred and blame. The operation that had saved my life had taken all that I held dear as a price, and left me incapacitated for months. However, I was wrong. At the highest point of despair, a change in my character was going to take place.Finding religion in the time of uncertainty, I often prayed to my patron saint, Kyrillos. During one night in the hospital, in the midst of the dim lights and muffled beeps, the distinct noise of a woman crying in the adjacent room awoke me. Drowsily, without much thought, I prayed that my saint would leave my bedside to comfort her.Immediately, I felt a sensation of my heart stopping. The experience of distraught hopelessness, as my heart began to give away, sparked something inside me. I found myself able to disregard my immediate needs for the sake of others. Additionally, the fear that I felt as I seemed to approach death awakened my broken soul. I became so immensely ashamed that I had given up; the notion that I deserve better disappeared. I was given the beautiful gift of life, a second chance to live fully and love fully.

Sitting within this curtain of invisibility, I can see the figures of other students and teachers gliding across the silver screen as though in a silent film sequence. It is in this familiar yet enchanted place that I have conducted many of my most enlightening interviews over the years. True, there is glamour in the notion that journalists serve as the \\'gatekeepers to the news,\\' and the opportunities I have been endowed with on a daily basis, from phone conversations with officials in the governor\\'s office to conferences with teen movie stars, are tantalizingly unlike any of the experiences offered to the typical high school student. Whether it is with a hot air ballooning agency struggling with increasingly strict restrictions each year or a homeless man searching for a purpose in life, interviews have led me to witness firsthand the beauty and pain of each individual\\'s story. It is incredibly humbling, and incredibly ironic that the resounding majority of the people I have spoken with I will never meet again, yet even as a stranger I was given the chance time and time again to share in their lives, to believe, to empathize. At first, I drank in this newfound perception and sought to shine the spotlight on the individual through my writing, struggling to freeze these transcendental moments I witnessed into the monochromatic ink of newsprint.But it was not until, in the comfort of the sub\\'s couches before a quaint tea-table and accompanied by a seemingly undepletable jar of Twizzler licorice candies, I was swept from the once pain-free bubble in which I dwelled into a whirlpool of emotions, that I began to realize that the quintessence of the human existence could never be captured in mere syllables. Reaching out to the parents of a student who was killed by a tragic prescription drug overdose, it was in the sub that I first learned to be sincere, to trust, to live, as the old couple\\'s optimism shamed the petty squabbles that had governed so much of my life until then, optimism that, though marred by regret, anger, and despair, engulfed an irrepressible hope. Never before having personally experienced sorrow so close to home, I was struck deeply by the family\\'s story\\\\u2014not only by their son\\'s passing, but even more by the unselfish willingness of his parents to share with me their most profound pain and most insightful reflections.

My eyes open abruptly. It has begun.Every year, my parents throw a five-day Christmas bash that would put most weddings to shame. We host and feed over 300 people complete with three-course meals, Christmas gifts, party favours and Bible readings. As the eldest son in my family, I have been helping with the management of Christmas since I was thirteen. From getting my littlest brother Nicco to wear his Christmas clothes to managing Aunt Daphne\\'s hyper-criticism, the fragile success of Christmas usually comes to rest quite a bit on my shoulders. This isn\\'t aided by the babysitting duty thrust upon me, nor by my relatives\\' constant barrage of questions.At home, it often felt like a circus without a ringmaster - It was impossible to lay down any rules much less implement them. This was in deep contrast to my experience as Vice Head boy of the Student Councilwhere my peers were empathetic, respectful and there was a democratic process for resolving issues.How does one organize a chaotic group of people that one loves?I\\'m not sure if I have discovered the answer, but there are three main things that I have derived from the experience. With those younger than me, like Nicco, an incentive-reward system is the most effective style of management. My little brother would probably become an assassin for enough chocolate. Secondly, managing people elder to me is all about polite deflection. Every time Aunt Daphne asks about why we haven\\'t changed our Christmas china, I invite her to gift us a set of her choice, because she has such discerning taste. Lastly, being kind usually goes a long way. Babu, the gentleman who manages our parking, works tirelessly to make sure all the guests are accommodated. So, I ensure that he has a steady stream of food, drinks and snacks sent out to him so that the event coasts on his goodwill. He sure loves my mother\\'s rose cookies!But most important of all, the values of the Bible have helped me definemy thoughts and actions. The merriment of Christmas is not just confined to my family. My brothers and I make sure that we pay a visit to the Orphanage near our home so that we can celebrate the Christmas cheer together with orphans. We spend time decorating the place, distributing sweets and singing carols. This exercise has helped me gain awareness of my responsibility towards the community and the value of leadership.The most rewarding aspect of Christmas for me is the opportunity to create new paintings every year. Before the guests arrive, I put up my new work all over the house and eagerly await the reactions of my family and friends.Art has inculcated an effortless zen in my practice - repetition and discipline have been like Olympic training in patience. Yet repetition, as Sisyphus has taught us, can be meaningless without awareness and attention to detail. From using the thinnest no.2 brush to choosing the larger colour composition of a canvas, detail is one of the main determinants of my artistic vision. Art, like most-important life lessons, has taught me to think big, and quite literally, see the big picture. This training has helped me choose the appropriate elements of my mother\\'s china, and match them with the d\\\\u00e9cor of the rest of the house. Most importantly, art as an expression of self has defined my perspective on life and learning, and I hope to add splashes of colour to any environment that I have the privilege of being in.After all, what is Christmas without the joy of colour!Intelligent machines, which were just a vision a few years ago, are today rapidly automatingevery common process around us. A fully automated future is impending, and as an aspiringcomputer scientist, this phenomenon excites me like no other. Every advancement in technology,from UBER to Neuralink, has propelled my interest and learning in computer science. I amintrigued by the numerous challenges we face today and excited about the possibility ofdiscovering elegant technological solutions to them. It has been my deepest desire to be apart of the growing community of creative people who work with technology and develop systems to effectively change the world for the better.I started pursuing my interest in Computer Science by choosing it as an elective in Highschool, Courses like C++ and SQL taught me to find digital solutions to real-world problems.Securing the 1st place on school level in National Cyber Olympiad (2014) was a majorconfidence booster and I was motivated to further improve my competency in Computer Science.My dreams turned into reality when I secured the highest percentage in the CBSE Class XIIExaminations and was titled \\'the school topper\\'. I strongly believe in the infinite possibilities that lie in creative and computational thinking. The versatility of math and Computer Science and their application to daily problems spurred me to hunt for new challenges. In August 2016, I participated in a \\'Design Thinking\\' program. This program prompted my team and me to think creatively and discuss ideas through computational thinking. This year, after my 12th-grade exams, I was fortunate to intern at Bridge Technology Partners\\' Cyber Security division - one of the leading enterprises in the field. It was here that I was introduced to latest technologies involved in penetration testing, remote surveillance and digital forensics. The experience also enriched me with skills used in a corporate environment like ethical behaviour, commitment to tasks and effective communication. To hone my leadership qualities, I contested in the school student body elections of 2016 and was chosen as the Vice Head Boy. I was actively involved in organizing fests, conferences and charitable events. As the President of the school quiz team and member of debating team, I have won several awards in the inter-school and intramural contests. Art has also been one of the most valuable determinants of my personality. It has inculcated an effortless zen in my practice - repetition and discipline have been like Olympic training for patience. I have always had a strong penchant for experiential learning. I had the opportunity tocomplete a Robotics camp at NASA, Orlando in 2015. The program exposed me to innovative technologies and helped me to thrive in a multicultural environment. Back home, at the Karnataka Blind Welfare Association, I pursued my passion in social activism and taught visually impaired children basic Math and English. The experience was priceless, and I learnt that perception is much deeper than vision.The real-world challenges along with evolving solutions in Computer Science & Robotics drive my long-term goals. I believe that Climate Change is one of the most pressing issues in the world right now. It is my deep desire to create a sustainable environment for the generations to come by applying my technological skills for solving climate change related issues. I feel optimistic about promising solutions on seeing the progress in areas like Machine Learning, Big Data Analytics, Neural Networking and micro-robotics.An undergraduate degree from the United Kingdom, with its challenging, research-oriented environment in an innovative community setting and rigorous coursework taught by outstanding faculty will help lay the foundations for achieving my ambitions.

My spring semester of my junior year was where I had a very busy schedule. I had AP classes and AP exams were coming up so I had to study for them. I had a college class on Mondays and Wednesdays and SAT prep on Tuesdays and Thursdays that made me stay longer until the evening, especially when I had Confirmation every Thursday right after. In some days, I had to take care of my older sister because my dad had errands to run to, usually buying groceries or picking up my mom from work in the late evening. My older sister has Down syndrome, meaning that I had to follow certain things that I can do to take care of my sister because of her condition. Taking care of my sister sometimes sacrificed the time spent on doing my academics and extracurriculars. All of this made me realize that I need to fix my time management skills. At first, I didn\\'t know how I could keep myself academically and mentally on course without jeopardizing the next few years that could be a pivot point in my life. I stick to this one advice from a few people that had went through a similar situation causing them to struggle very much. That advice was to start with one thing at a time. It was simple advice that personally changed my everyday habits. Because of it, this challenge definitely helped me in the long run. The more I was adapted to doing things one by one, the more productive and organized I\\'ve become. Doing it on a daily basis made helped me set my priorities straight, finish things earlier than I expected to be, and I get more time to spend for myself, such as reading or finishing up my homework.In all of my years, I never realized that until now, Environmental Science has been my favorite subject. It all started when I watched this show called \\'Fetch with Ruff Ruffman\\'. I remember every day I would get home from school and quickly go to my room, turn on the T.V., hoping that I didn\\'t miss anything from that day\\'s episode. The show talked about many scientific topics that I find very interesting, like physics, chemistry, and etc. As an elementary school student, this was something that I never knew about in school, until I get to watch the show. The show made me realize that science is fun, cool, and interesting to learn about. Although I enjoyed this show as a child, I never imagined actually enjoying science classes, that is, until I took AP Environmental Science this year. On the first day of school, our teacher talked about what\\'s the biggest environmental issue we are facing today. Our assignment was to make a poster relating to the issue we picked and list what are some of the effects that is harmful to the world. Most of the class, even me, chose air pollution as the biggest issue we faced today. Although most of the people chose that topic, they didn\\'t know much about air pollution. I knew that our assignment can\\'t do it on its own, so I took the initiative to lead my group using my prior knowledge about air pollution. After we finished our assignment, our teacher decided to have a class discussion on the topic we have chosen. From what I learn from that activity was not only the fact that overpopulation might be the biggest problem we face. It was rather realizing how my passion brought out the best in me. From the discussion that I\\'ve participated in, seeing myself being serious on a topic that\\'s relevant today influenced how doing something I love should be what I do as a major/career. I felt that from that experience, it benefits what I want to pursue in the future.There were many things that I participated and supported that benefited my school. One of which was the Green Team. When I first started in the school, I felt somewhat lost because high school was a culture shock for me and my friends. Our school was more diverse, more rigorous in academics, and it had more variety in clubs. Me and my friends decided to join our campus\\' environmental club, the Green Team. During that year, I enjoyed my time being at the club. Not only was it an escape from school and a bonding moment with my friends and other students that were above my grade, but I was proud to contribute to something that I think is so important to my community that might affect the future.For the next few years, there was inactivity throughout the school year where our Green Team lost both its essence and popularity. When there were elections for senior year, I knew I had the opportunity to turn this club back around to the way it used to be. Now as President, I sought for a resurgence in the Green Team for the sake of not only making our club more hardworking and strenuous, but also bringing a long-lasting effect all over the world but for our campus. What I do to ensure that our club is being active is organizing and leading school and beach clean- ups, volunteering more community service focusing on the environment, fundraising for reusable water bottles created by the club, and making sure we are able to promote environmental awareness to the school through presentations. The reason I wanted to bring the club back is not because I wanted to recreate the moments that made the Green Team special that other members can look back to. I also want to display my deep passion in environmentalism that can reflect towards the members of the club, even to the students in my campus, hopefully changing their ways and ideas that can fulfill my aim of the club: making the environment a better place.Reading was something I disliked as a kid. I was the type of kid who loved to play games and toys as an activity rather than read. My reading ability remained stagnant at that point in my childhood. Throughout my early education, my reading scores were usually lower than the average student. During the 5th grade, our class had to take a reading comprehension test every time we\\'ve finished reading a story. My reading comprehension tests were so bad that my 5th-grade teacher even offered some help. However, during the process, I felt somewhat discouraged and hopeless with improving my reading ability. Although the help resulted in slightly improving my tests and quizzes, it never happens to feel like I\\'ve achieved this personal academic obstacle.Then middle school came and that was when the next few years became life-changing and unforgettable. At my school, the library had this program called \\'Reading Counts!\\' where students are engaged to read many varieties of books and earn points by taking quizzes corresponding to the book\"}, {\"index\": 227, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'This summer, all of you \\\\u2013 yes, all of you \\\\u2013 will leave this campus a changed person.\\'Cramped into the bleachers on one side of a gymnasium far too small for its convocationand suffocated by the heat of 600 sweaty, impatient high schoolers, I both felt and heard thecollective skepticism emanating from the crowd. It was the same speech many of us had heardcountless times before, the same speech anytime our parents had forced us to attend soccer campor music camp or camping camp \\\\u2013 it was the same speech. When I first learned of my acceptanceinto the Governor\\'s Honors Program, I was somewhat apathetic. Its tagline of \\'Georgia\\'s Finest\\'struck me as comical, its mission and vision clich\\\\u00e9. I discounted the enthusiasm of my friendswho had attended in years past as post hoc fabrications, memories distorted by time andcontorted by obligations for positivity.As a violin major, I walked into class the first day with the expectation of practicingseveral hours a day, playing in long rehearsals and performing classical pieces as I had in somany music camps before. As we sat in a circle, preparing to perform the ritualistic introductionsand icebreakers high school students have biologically adapted to perform, I looked around theroom and recognized several acquaintances whom I had met at Allstate or youth symphonies. Iexamined the conductor, a short Asian man with a middle part and a satchel strewn over hisshoulder. I made eye contact with a violist who, as I vaguely remembered, didn\\'t like me at allon account of one fateful day back in 7 th grade. By all counts, the next four weeks seemed anodyssey, its course determined by my attitude and actions. Sitting there that first day, though, Icould never have imagined that I would soon be a part of the Lightning McQuintet, watching myfriends perform a La La Land medley and crying with laughter as my conductor dabbed in frontof the entire music department. I could never have imagined that practicing for 2 hours wouldbecome some of my most enjoyable experiences, not because of what I was practicing butbecause of who I was practicing with. That the 3 to 4-hour symphony rehearsals would be someof the most musically gratifying moments I had ever experienced, that our quartet rehearsalswould become \\'group meditation\\' sessions, that we would eat cup ramen every day despiteeating dinner just hours before, I could never have imagined. I\\'ll never forget the hot, stickynights when we lay in the grass and talked about our favorite foods and our favorite movies,complaining about our summer work and discussing the geopolitics of Southeast Asia. I\\'ll neverforget the discovery that, among the 22 string majors, several were valedictorians, some werefuture leaders interning at big corporations, and a handful were varsity athletes. Our conductorhad graduated from Wharton before re-evaluating his passions and returning to music and one ofour cellists\\' older brother was going to Juilliard on a full ride and my stand partner had gotten aperfect score on the SAT \\\\u2013 and I was a small fish in a big sea. At some point in the 4 weeks, Istopped looking at the orchestra around me as violinists and violists, cellists and bassists; Istarted looking at them as individuals, and as I did so, I started seeing them for who they were,not just as names on a list or as accomplishments on a resume but as people with hopes anddreams, pasts and futures.This summer, I left that campus a changed person. When I first learned of my acceptanceinto the Governor\\'s Honors Program, I was somewhat apathetic.Boy, was I in for a surprise.\"}, {\"index\": 228, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Muy, narod Soyedinyonikh Shtatov Ameriki...\\'Spoken in Russian, especially to American students, the US Constitution sounds little like the original refrain. But to E, my classmate from Moscow, those words meant everything. The day she recited the Preamble in her native language in front of our eighth-grade history class, I found myself captivated by her speech. The foreign rhythm mesmerized me: As I attempted to decipher the whirlwind of E\\'s rolled r\\'s and cryptic expressions, I craved for understanding.For the next several months, I filled my mind with miscellaneous Russian phrases, but without practice, my efforts fell flat. My \\'passion\\' could only truly take flight two years later when a thick envelope arrived in my mailbox, announcing my acceptance to the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy. Upon arriving to campus in the fall, the first class I enrolled in was Russian.Russian class quickly became my escape from the familiar. While math and science provided me with comfort, the infinite permutations and mysteries of language opened my mind to entirely new ways of thinking. I could just barely wrap my head around the diminutive forms of my Russian name, Sergei: At any given time I could be Seryozh, Seryozha, or Seryozhenka. I imagined myself as a fearless warrior, but instead of fighting barrages of flaming arrows, I defeated endless conjugations and decoded confusing letters into fascinating words and sounds. I could do anything -- by the end of my sophomore year, I thought myself invincible.That impression changed the following year, shortly after I landed in Saint Petersburg, Russia with eight other exchange students. I expected myself to be fluent, easily navigating Cyrillic signs and speaking unaccented Russian; instead, I was overwhelmed, puzzled by the cacophony of language around me and woefully unprepared to bring my Russian into the real world. The mistakes began as soon as I reached the apartment, where I addressed my host parents with an informal privyet rather than the more respectful zdravstvuyte. More embarrassment greeted me after I had unpacked my luggage and my host mother N.P. asked me whether I wanted to eat or sleep. I responded with a single da (meaning \\'yes\\'), leaving us both completely perplexed.Despite the linguistic chaos, I pushed on, motivated by the obsession that had led me to take Russian to begin with. In the process, I let each of the Ps introduce me to new linguistic worlds. N\\'s specialty was geography, and our discussions were always full of faraway lands. Chikago, she taught me, was simply \\'Chicago\\' pronounced in a Russian accent, while the adjective for German\\\\u2014 Nemetskii\\\\u2014 seemed anything but intuitive. A, my host brother, introduced me to teenage slang. Ya umirayu s golodu, as I learned, translated to \\'I\\'m dying of starvation\\': The phrase would save me on several late-night, foodless excursions. Although I occasionally tripped over my new vocabulary, I had finally found room to grow.Living, eating, and joking with people like the Ps -- that\\'s how I can truly call myself a good Russian student. They helped me realize that my curiosity is best paired with a pinch of modesty; anyone can become my teacher, if I let them. Now back in America, I still do not know all the answers-- but rather than let that fact discourage me, I return to the classroom, ready to master more grammar, write more Cyrillic, and add more words to my inventory. Along the way I will make mistakes, but I will not let failure dissuade me: After all, the gaps in my knowledge are what encourage me to trudge on, unraveling the world one word at a time.\"}, {\"index\": 229, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Please don\\'t tell me you\\'ve bitten one of your classmates again\\', her eyes pleaded. When the school principal called my mother, asking to have a private conversation with her, she instantly deemed me guilty of a toothy crime. Although I must admit there was background for this accusation, I wasn\\'t guilty this time \\\\u2014 not of this crime, at least. My actual wrongdoing had been to bite the forbidden fruit, getting a taste of the knowledge reserved to the big kids. I had learned to read and to write on my own, at the age of three.Analyzing the occasion from an impartial point of view, it was merely a supply and demand dilemma: I wanted to hear more stories, but nobody could find more time to read them for me. I did not want to be just a passive listener, dependent on others\\' goodwill, so I took the matter into my own hands and did the only thing I could do: read.Needless to say, this event shaped my life. I skipped two grades in school and won a scholarship to one of the best schools in Cear\\\\u00e0. As a kid that came from a low-income family, this opportunity meant the world for me. In the beginning, I didn\\'t adapt very well. As a kid accustomed to learning on her own, my mind did not stick to the endless lessons the teacher taught. Why did it matter if three was an odd number if I could still divide three cakes between my mother and me? As time passed, however, new classes were added to the curriculum, and school finally managed to get my attention. Finally, the science laboratory classes started.A new world was introduced to me, in which I could see that theory and practice fit perfectly. On my quest to understand these phenomena, I spent hours looking through encyclopedias, bothering adults with my questions and browsing the internet seeking answers. I found meaning in the seemingly useless numbers the teachers taught; if they were the language of science, then I would willingly study them. To help those struggling with those classes, I became a volunteer tutor at my school, an experience that taught me that although some of my classmates weren\\'t interested in science, it only took a bit of polyol and isocyanate to change their minds.It was only in 9th grade, however, that my interest became serious. What before I before knew as science then branched to physics, chemistry, and biology, and scientific olympiads made a debut in my life. My participation in olympiads placed me in the national selection exams for the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO). I had dreamt of the possibility of representing my country in a high-level competition like IChO since I was young, and when one of the best preparatory schools in Brazil offered me a scholarship to help me in this pursuit, I immediately accepted the offer. At Col\\\\u00e9gio Ari de S\\\\u00e0 Cavalcante, I met some of my country\\'s brightest students, and their hard work inspired me to dive deeper into my education, giving all that I had until the very end. Although I didn\\'t make it into the national team, the knowledge and maturity I gained on my journey made it more than worth it.I am proud to say education changed my life. I am grateful for all the opportunities I received, and that is why I work hard to improve the quality of life in my community, be it volunteering at schools or simply visiting children hospitals to read for them. I believe that education is the only way out of the systemic poverty present in Brazil today. I will commit myself to the effort of making education a universal right, instead of a privilege for the very few who can afford it, so that others\\' lives can be changed just as much as mine was.\"}, {\"index\": 230, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Don\\'t name them,\\' I remember my dad said on our way home from Brooks Feed and Farm.     \\'Why? We name everything else.\\' I replied. \\'It\\'s just easier.\\'I named one Gammon, anyway. They arrived at the store two weeks after I ordered them, shipped in a cardboard box with holes punched in it. After spending countless nights flipping endlessly through Brooks\\' catalog, I was confident these pheasants were going to be perfect. There were four, the minimum order Brooks\\' allowed.\\'Wait, why pheasants?\\' I remember my dad had asked when he first found out about my little venture.I replied, \\'They\\'re for fly fishing!\\'  I had become obsessed. It was not enough to visit LLBean\\'s Hunting and Fishing store. I had to construct these flies from start to finish, know what was on the end of my line. I had to be responsible for my own feathers, not dependent on just any that came from some far off place. At the time, my eight-year-old self did not realize that this went beyond normal, beyond long sweeping casts into a stream. I was living in the dream of fishing during the day, Orvis books at night. But why was I so fixated on fly fishing? There was no family tradition, no fishing club. I arrived at this intense fascination on my own. Eventually, and perhaps inevitably, interest in fishing started to fade, replaced increasingly with a different but similarly fierce pursuit: music. It was my fly rod for a banjo, fly vise for staff paper, babbling brooks for open concert halls. True to my character, what started as traditional bluegrass evolved rapidly into an affinity for jazz and classical styles. I became not merely involved in one world of music but instead immersed in many: an expression of my ever-curious passion. While strange to some, my intensely inquisitive personality had driven me silently forward. And slowly, I began to view my personality as a benefit, both as a tool to drive my exploration of diverse interests and a trait to help achieve my greatest aspirations.As a child, I was constantly surrounded by a tactile learning steeped in genuine interest. My father was a creative force of nature. Through handmade beehives and Adirondack chairs, barn raisings and boat restorations, my personality began to evolve. The environment created by my father\\'s ethos encouraged creativity and deep exploration. In a world satisfied by \\'Made in China\\', I was nestled in the comfort of self-reliance and the contentment that came with wood shavings and feather clippings on the ground. Influenced by these surroundings, I have become a person constantly questioning the world around me. And no matter what my next passion might be, I know that I will bring to it an inquisitive nature, delving well past its normal bounds.As things on a farm often go, my four pheasant chicks dwindled down to two, and then finally to one. But one grown pheasant was enough. It was all I needed to furnish my fly fishing endeavors for the year to come and complete my quest for a full understanding of my passion. What might have started as the simple tie of a fly had grown to much more. It far exceeded raising a bird for its feathers or the grim notion our farm had one less pheasant. I still have those flies I tied in the months that followed, stored neatly in my fly box. Almost nine years later, they\\'re next to the wooden case holding my banjo picks. While rods and flies have long had their places taken by the tunes of banjos and fiddles, one concept remains: no matter the experience, I forge an intense resolve and pursuit for learning that will always be an integral part of my identity, making me thankful for my \\'strange\\' personality that began in the pages of a farm supply catalog. Being a banjo player, my music and ability are often defined explicitly. I am supposed to be found by my neighbors in the acoustic music scene of Portland, not Blue Hill\\'s rich classical culture. My goal as a musician, then, has been to break these bounds. My aim is to show Maine\\'s bluegrass community that banjo players can discuss the syncopated piano ostinatos in 8 Lines by Reich. My purpose is to demonstrate to my classical neighbors that I can still be found immersed in the age-old debate about which finger leads a Scruggs roll. Consequently, I am caught in between these two worlds of music, acting as a bridge between them. In doing so, I have tried to reached out and gain from everyone involved in these separate communities, thus leaving a footprint of someone keen to learn and eager to explore music in all forms, regardless of any stereotype that might exist. Now, I would like to bring this same mentality to Dartmouth. In all aspects of my life, not just music, I try to push the boundaries of and make connections between seemingly separate interests. I believe that with people across the world connected via internet and smartphones, an interconnected approach to learning is the only way to enact solutions in our world today.

I had kept my journal with me for three weeks as I identified the sources of my sorrow. I was unlocking my suppressed thoughts whilst simultaneously looking at them through analytical eyes; I was healing myself. At first, I kept my journal because I had a desire to leave behind an artifact for future archaeologists to discover and regard as characteristic of the twenty-first century. As I grew older, I sincerely wanted to immerse myself in writing; however, I could not bring myself to look at it as more than a cumbersome chore. I never understood the purpose of journals. Also, the utter horror I experienced when my older sister found my journal deterred me from ever keeping a journal again. It was not until my freshmen year that writing transformed into a form of healing. For a year and a half, I knew my grandmother was withering away from stage three gastric cancer. When she died, I did not cry. I rationalized my stoic demeanor as desensitization from the multiple visits to the hospital. Because I felt emotionless, I agreed to babysit my two baby cousins while most of my family went to Pakistan for the funeral. I made them buttery pancakes for breakfast and prepared warm, hearty curries for lunch and dinner. I laughed and amused them with silly games and anecdotes until I put them to bed. Yet, each night, while they dreamt serenely, I was plagued by my grandmother\\'s sunken eyes and transparent skin until I too fell asleep. I continued this routine for a week, until the eighth day, when my carefully crafted tranquility soon evaporated. I woke up in the early morning shaking from my violent sobs. I never felt so vulnerable and frightened by my emotions before, and I did not know whom to confide in. There were people all around me, but my emotions felt too intimate to share. Immediately, the notion of journal keeping returned to me. There it was, at the bottom of my closet, covered in webs. The outside blue cover felt cold as I lifted it from the ground. As I flipped through to find an empty page, I felt a sense of warmth at the end of each break. I immediately began to sketch all my thoughts. As I recounted my grandmother\\'s illness, I identified all the streams of grief that collected into my current outburst. Most importantly, I was forced to face the regret I felt for not openly expressing my love for my grandmother while she was alive. I kept my journal with me for days, writing constantly. With each sentence, I acknowledged the existence of my feelings and let them gradually release from my mind. Little did I know, I was healing myself. As days progressed, I began to realize how journal keeping forced me to be honest with myself. I no longer thought of it as a mundane record of daily events, but as an intimate therapy session with my thoughts and feelings. Simply an opportunity to immerse in the deep confounds of writing. Having grown from this experience, I have continued to refine and implement this art of writing through science research. Journal keeping has not only allowed me to enhance my writing skills, but it also serves as a way for me to express my ideas and take a new approach towards learning. As I take the next step in life, my once held passion for journal keeping will aid my curiosity for scientific research. I kept my pen with me and closed my journal, knowing I would return to it another day.\"}, {\"index\": 232, \"new_personal_statement\": \"From being born in Belgium while my parents were working overseas to my world view as a queer teenager, I am a firm believer in the fact that my experiences have shaped me. Up until high school, I went to an international school that followed the IB system. As part of this program, the words \\'Inquirer\\', \\'Principled\\' and \\'Open-minded\\', among others, were proudly displayed in French, English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese and Dutch in every classroom throughout my elementary and middle school education. These words subconsciously became my guiding purpose. For most of my life, I was a student in an environment with people from over one-hundred countries, with a multitude of life experiences different from my own. Because of my strong moral education, and the international identities of my classmates, I began to see difference as something to celebrate rather than be ashamed of, and failed to understand why people felt the need to discriminate against others. I see myself as a citizen of a world first, and an American citizen second. I value the relationships I have with people from other countries, refuse to let country lines become an obstacle in my search for understanding and knowledge. The three people I consider my best friends from my time in elementary school are from Holland, Madagascar, and Canada. As well as growing up in a culturally-diverse environment, I began learning French at the age of two. My babysitter spoke Tagalog fluently and I would pick up slang from her. When my parents would discuss something they didn\\'t want my sister and me to understand, they would do so in Hungarian, which they both speak fluently. I took classes in Mandarin in third grade, and learned the Arabic alphabet in fifth grade. In sixth grade, I taught myself how to write in Japanese. I joined the American Sign Language club at my middle school, and have been pursuing sign ever since. I started Spanish classes in high school. Languages have been a formative part of my youth, and are especially important to me as an actor because they have instilled a deep fascination for words and an appreciation for grammar, things I find most people take for granted. From an early age, I have learned to approach everything from a place of respect and curiosity. This is especially true in theater. If an actor writes off a character as \\'different\\', or allows their character to fit fully under a label, they will find it almost impossible to add dimension and relate to their character. The same values and skills that made me the open-minded person I am today are necessary for my acting. They have caused me to approach my work with a sense of integrity and a need for understanding. My international perspective allows me to see things from multiple vantage points, and seek authenticity in my work. From being born in Belgium while my parents were working overseas to my world view as a queer teenager, I am a firm believer in the fact that my experiences have shaped me. Up until high school, I went to an international school that followed the IB system. As part of this program, the words \\'Inquirer\\', \\'Principled\\' and \\'Open-minded\\', among others, were proudly displayed in French, English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese and Dutch in every classroom throughout my elementary and middle school education. These words subconsciously became my guiding purpose. For most of my life, I was a student in an environment with people from over one-hundred countries, with a multitude of life experiences different from my own. Because of my strong moral education, and the international identities of my classmates, I began to see difference as something to celebrate rather than be ashamed of, and failed to understand why people felt the need to discriminate against others. I see myself as a citizen of a world first, and an American citizen second. I value the relationships I have with people from other countries, refuse to let country lines become an obstacle in my search for understanding and knowledge. The three people I consider my best friends from my time in elementary school are from Holland, Madagascar, and Canada. As well as growing up in a culturally-diverse environment, I began learning French at the age of two. My babysitter spoke Tagalog fluently and I would pick up slang from her. When my parents would discuss something they didn\\'t want my sister and me to understand, they would do so in Hungarian, which they both speak fluently. I took classes in Mandarin in third grade, and learned the Arabic alphabet in fifth grade. In sixth grade, I taught myself how to write in Japanese. I joined the American Sign Language club at my middle school, and have been pursuing sign ever since. I started Spanish classes in high school. Languages have been a formative part of my youth, and are especially important to me as an actor because they have instilled a deep fascination for words and an appreciation for grammar, things I find most people take for granted. From an early age, I have learned to approach everything from a place of respect and curiosity. This is especially true in theater.

I knew making the team last year meant nothing now. As I ran down the endless path along the Hudson River, I was faced with my final challenge at the yearly lacrosse tryouts. This was the same mile that got me cut from soccer the year before. I had watched in envy as the soccer girls flaunted their new pinnies, while I felt unwelcome--so I closed myself off. I never wanted to feel that way again, so I resolved to prove I belonged on lacrosse--by beating my mile time.Before lacrosse season started, I forced myself to run a mile every day. Even though my sore muscles ached, I was determined to prove I deserved my spot on the team. In freshman year, while some players got to play the whole game, my lacrosse coach only subbed me in when we were losing badly. On those occasions, I sprinted for every pass, and when I slipped, I picked myself back up. Despite my best efforts, I wasn\\'t able to affect the score, but the sidelines still cheered me on, making me feel welcome. I wanted to carry this spirit on to next year\\'s team. Beads of sweat dripped off my chin as I reassured myself I deserved this. I mustered a final burst of energy and sprinted past another girl, coming in somewhere around tenth, but definitely not last.One of our games was on the field where I used to play soccer. I felt estranged once again, but I pushed it aside. I had already earned my spot. Once Coach put me in, I scanned the field for the ball and made eye contact with my struggling teammate. Without a word, we knew what to do. That instant communication with her was the true moment I made the team, not at tryouts. The ball shot across the sky, breaking my reverie. I held my breath until I felt the silent thump of the ball landing in my stick. I took off, outrunning all my opponents. In one swift motion, I whipped a quick shot into the net. My first shot was the first goal in the game.\\'JANET!\\' My coach called.I looked at the sidelines. She motioned for me to come back; next to her was another girl lined up to take my place. What had I done wrong? No, it wasn\\'t me. This was a new freshman, eager to play the last minute of the game. I cheered with encouragement that ignited the sidelines, even when she fumbled and dropped some good passes. Suddenly, I realized, that was me last year--and my cheering grew louder.Although we lost, I gained more from the sidelines than playing the game. I thought all I wanted from lacrosse was the glory, but the game didn\\'t end with me: it ended with her. Being closed off after soccer prevented me from developing strong bonds with my teammates, which affected our dynamic on the field. Now, I was finally part of a team.I applied lessons from that game to creating a mobile app over the summer and was content with taking a step back. My development team overcame our challenges by giving each idea a chance, gaining trust along the way. Although we weren\\'t first in the competition, we applauded the team that was, because we knew we had won too.My presence on the sidelines, my enthusiasm for others, were proof we often focus too much on the numbers and capabilities, yet it\\'s the intangible, our relationships as a team, that accounted for our win.\"}, {\"index\": 234, \"new_personal_statement\": \"PROMPT: Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story. There\\'s a picture I think of often: one thousand bees within a thin plastic ball. Some are motionless, comfortable in the vacuous center of the bubble. Others are pushing and prodding at the surface, directing the course of the ball. Our society is that plastic ball, and it needs the movement of its bees. To keep our bubble from dropping and to push it towards any inkling of progress, we must continuously fly at our limits. True advocates aren\\'t those who settle but those who care deeply, reflect continuously, and never stop pushing. As I\\'ve come to understand this, I have tried to empower my cheeky younger brothers, Brandon and Brian, to be bees in their own lives. Every day after school, I take my brothers to the library and sit beside them while they struggle with the nuanced moral dilemmas in their reading. I wonder how they, at eleven and eight years old, make sense of books like The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing, the story of an African American slave who is manipulated into an experiment to prove white supremacy. On their birthdays, I challenge my brothers with gifts of novels beyond their reading levels. Together, we experience the pensive sadness of Ender\\'s Game, a tale of interspecies war, that compels Brandon to borrow all of its sequels from the library and Brian to read through dinner multiple nights in a row. Reading Ender\\'s story, I hope that they can develop empathy for all beings\\\\u2014including those fundamentally different from us. Most recently, we forayed into the musical phenomenon Hamilton, the passionate songs of which reinforce to us society\\'s need for determination in the face of disapproval.Now Alexander Hamilton himself was a \\'bee.\\' The author of 51 of the 85 Federalist papers that successfully and poignantly argued for the ratification of the U.S Constitution, Hamilton never stopped pushing. In exploring his story with my brothers, I could plainly see how Hamilton moved American society forward and how concerned citizens today must embody the same level of dogged advocacy that he possessed.At school, I like to think that I have already begun to. When I learned that my school\\'s constitution was outdated and teeming with loopholes, making our student government less transparent and unaccountable, I rewrote it entirely. With the help of friends, I continued to bridge the gap between students and student leaders by building a forum that gives students direct access to candidates\\' platforms and a means to voice the matters on their minds.However, in trying to be an advocate, I have also failed. While leading a mental health campaign at school, I mistakenly ostracized the very students I was trying to help by underestimating the complexity of mental illness. My team and I simplistically, though inadvertently, implied that the stigma of mental illness could be meaningfully addressed by celebratory activities and stress balls. We conflated daily struggles with disease, common stress with serious illness. This was not the advocate I had wanted to be, and it took weeks of conscious listening and earnest communication to right my failure of insight.I often wonder, does the direction in which we bees push actually matter? Or does the very act of trying, through the process of elimination, allow us to find the \\'right\\' direction? What I do know is that I cannot forget what it means to deeply care, for seemingly innocuous comments like \\'good enough,\\' if left unchallenged, will undermine societal progress. Advocates, like bees, need to live at the edges where though we may be least protected by our walls, we can also escape their restrictions\\\\u2014I\\'ve learned that it is at the edges far beyond \\'good enough\\' where the essence of progress lies.\"}, {\"index\": 235, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 236, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Oh no, Michelle! Can you even eat those?\\' Celia\\'s mother exclaimed, seeing the two cheeseburgers on my plate. The beef patties and slices of cheddar cheese stacked between two tiny buns were definitely not kosher. Yet, they definitely looked delicious. I was at an impasse. My family ate only kosher foods in our household and my friend\\'s mother knew of my dietary restrictions. After years of following the scientific method in school, I deduced there was no solid evidence barring me from eating the adorably small cheeseburgers. I shrugged and bit into the slider.My parents, Soviet refugees who came to America to escape anti-Semitism, pride themselves in being able to observe their faith openly. When my grandfather passed away, my father became more religiously observant to cope with his grief. My family followed his example and began the transition away from our previous, less rigorous traditions. We decidedly identified ourselves as Orthodox Jews.Dressed in modest, black clothing, I came to my first Orthodox service to support my father. I sat on the opposite side of the room from him and the rabbis leading the service. A lace fabric, called a mechitza, separated the men and women. \\'This seems sexist,\\' I thought. At eleven years old, alienated from the equality of my past synagogue, my modern mentality became apparent. Yet, my father looked happy, smiling at me from across the gender divide. Our difference in attitude prompted my uncertainty. I wondered if I was wrong for questioning a simple seating arrangement.In contrast, I found certainty within my academics. I felt more comfortable with my schoolwork than abstract traditions. When conducting an experiment, I knew exactly why I was following certain steps; religion didn\\'t provide this same confidence. In AP Statistics, I learned how to prove a hypothesis significantly true with a direct methodology. No mysteries remained a mystery; unlike the religious divine, math questions could be systematically verified. In AP Chemistry, where I measured acids and bases in (almost) perfect proportions to create a neutralized solution, the logic behind the science was clear. This precise reasoning contrasted to my struggle with religion where I had no way to determine which level of observance was correct.My inability to find rationality within Judaism caused me to stop practicing religion. During this time, my father and I argued daily. I saw him as a traditionalist, stuck in his ways, while I was as a modern woman pursuing academic interests. However, I felt disconnected from my father. Perhaps, I was being too harsh and judgmental due to my discomfort with his beliefs.As the years wore on, I noticed my father reading Hebrew prayer books late into the night. His studies led him to keep a detailed list of questions at the ready for whenever he invited rabbis to our home. In many ways, the diligence he took in discovering his beliefs were parallel to my own academic inquiry. Both of us craved knowledge and understanding. For him, religion was a salve to deal with his grief over the loss of a parent. For me, schoolwork offered the solace of clear answers in lieu of rituals and prayers.Debating with my father on the tenants of his ideology hasn\\'t been easy. Nevertheless, we find commonality in a main principle of Judaism: the encouragement of questioning. Unlike many other religions, Judaism doesn\\'t comport itself to blind faith. Instead, one is instructed to catechize in order to strengthen one\\'s beliefs. By finding a common trait of intellectual curiosity with my father, we\\'ve reached a de\\\\u0301tente.These days, my questions still aren\\'t fully answered. I\\'m working to find my set of beliefs by applying reasoning to whatever crosses my path (including cheeseburgers).

I\\'m fortunate enough to be able to turn to scientific research, where I can shed light on some of my most burning questions (and hopefully improving lives one day too). However, I wasn\\'t always this way. I found my endless curiosity in a rather unorthodox manner.When I was young, I was one of those children who never could sit still. For me though, running around wasn\\'t the antidote to my antics. Instead, the only thing which could make me sit still was an answer to the question, \\'Why?\\' Invariably though, whatever answer I had managed to procure would only tame my curiosity for a few minutes, and before long, the whole cycle would start over again.One day, frustrated, my mother handed me \\'The Big Book of Questions and Answers\\', and I plopped myself down in a massive leather chair and was hooked immediately. I immersed myself in everything that book had to offer, from astronomy to zoology. Before long, I had reached the back cover. However, I remained deeply unsatisfied.There remained so many more questions to be answered! I took to the internet.It was then that I first stumbled upon Wikipedia. I vividly recall diving into the its depths, an explorer who had stumbled upon something new, something huge! I became a sleuth, hot on the trail of the next answer. In an almost trance-like state, I could sit for hours on end, trying to absorb as much information as I possibly could hold, clicking link after link. I turned into Indiana Jones, returning time and time again, each time driven by an insatiable curiosity. Upon each return to the seemingly endless depths of Wikipedia, I was drawn in by yet another question.Perhaps the day\\'s events would lead me to inquire about lasers or Dracula or anything in between.One day though, while deep into an investigation on dreaming (how exactly do they happen?And why?), I ran into a problem \\\\u2013 a big one. The webpage stared back at me blankly, asking me to help start a new page. The unthinkable had happened. I had simply run out of hyperlinks. The next answer didn\\'t live in the next click. The next answer didn\\'t even exist at all. Even then, I knew I had reached something substantial: the edge of Wikipedia, the limits of human knowledge. Now, I knew, the game had changed. It wasn\\'t that I lost the drive to keep wondering, but rather that there wasn\\'t anything more to find. Beyond this point, there was simply\\\\u2026 nothing. This concept of non-existence, this state of not knowing, if anything, fascinated me more than anything else. Yet, at the same time, it frustrated me to no end. How there could be no further clues to follow, no more answers to find on this trail?As I grew older, I discovered my own way of finding more answers and creating new knowledge. My childhood Wikipedia adventures are the reason that, today, research is such a fascinating venture to me. In doing research, reaching the edge isn\\'t the objective, it\\'s only the first step. Digging through the literature is like following every hyperlink in sight, doing my best to grab as much information as I can as you push closer and closer to the edge.When I get there, doing research is choosing a nice spot along the edge, and saying to myself, \\'Yes. I think this\\'ll be mine.\\' Then, I poke and prod at the edge until it budges, even just a teeny tiny bit. And then I\\'ve made a permanent contribution. I\\'ve pushed past the edge.

This place was where I felt the most comfortable but my insecurities were surfacing. For the first time in my life, I was no longer a camper, and soon I would have responsibilities and challenges to face. In an attempt to regain my composure, I took a few deep breathes and stepped outside into camp.What was going through your head when you signed up for this, genius?Confronted with the challenge to get outside my comfort zone, I knew exactly where to go. I could hear their shrieks and giggles from across the lake, and I became more apprehensive with each closer step I took. Once I arrived, I was astonished that I was able to muster the words and ask to join. Much to my surprise, I was warmly welcomed, or so I thought. I jumped in the GaGa Pit and joined the ranks of the campers. \\'3\\\\u2026 2\\\\u2026 1\\\\u2026\\' The pit erupted into chaos and battle cries engulfed my surroundings. Although I wasn\\'t much older than some of the kids, being a staff member immediately set me apart and made me a target. Fatigued from dodging countless attacks, I sought cover in a corner where I found myself next to young boy, no older than five. Quickly, I realized this could be my chance to make a difference.Why do you keep letting the thoughts of others stop you, scaredy-cat?I gathered the courage to introduce myself, and he told me his name was Teddy. He didn\\'t understand the game, so I demonstrated how to play, and we became allies. Teddy and I never won a game, but as a smile crept across his face I knew I had made a difference. As the kids began to disperse elsewhere throughout camp, I invited Teddy to play another game. He ruled as the king of Four Square all afternoon and was amused my histrionical attempts to lose. As we bonded throughout the day, I realized Teddy saw me as an adult figure. Here, I had always been the child myself, and even though I was on staff, it was hard to grasp the fact that I was growing up.Can you really handle the other responsibilities you have, nerd?The next few days were a blur filled with a multitude of adventures: I tamed horses at the barn, wielded paint brushes at the craft shop, perfected milkshakes at the snack bar, maintained sailboats at the waterfront, and mastered heights on the zipline at adventure. I was able to complete these tasks almost effortlessly, but as an introvert, I continued to struggle interacting with others. Teddy would often visit me wherever I worked, confide in me, and tell tales of his extravagant endeavors. Throughout the week, I was able to build a strong relationship with Teddy and develop as a person through my interactions with him.After your hard work did you even leave an impact, nobody?On the final night, as I said goodbye to Teddy, his parents approached us and took a moment to thank me. I had worked diligently across the entire camp for a week now, but all that mattered to me was if I had made a difference in someone\\'s life. When I heard the impact I was able to have on Teddy, all of my insecurities were resolved. I stopped listening to the ridicule from my inner demons and became an entirely new person. That week the anxious, introverted boy was transformed into the outgoing, self-assured character I still am today.\\'Thank you so much for everything you\\'ve done, you really made Teddy feel special this week.\\'\"}, {\"index\": 239, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Two years ago, I went to the hair salon for a routine visit. Though I had only been frequenting a few months, it possessed a familiar feel: the women, both stylists and clients, spoke like old friends of the news, television, and, of course, hair.\\'You should cut off the relaxed ends,\\' my stylist suggested. She knew more about natural hair than anyone else I knew. \\'They\\'ll only break off if you don\\'t. Plus, you\\'ll feel freer.\\' I hesitated. I had only been transitioning from relaxed to natural for a few months by then; the chemically altered ends still made up half of its length. I had not discussed this with my mother, and I still did not know whether I would stay natural. If I went back to a relaxer, I would regret cutting off my hair. I agreed and watched the limp pieces fall to the floor.In storytelling, cutting hair does not come without its heavy meanings: liberation, dishonor, new beginnings, or loss of self. When Samson\\'s hair was cut, he lost his strength; Siddhartha cut his hair on his path to enlightenment. When those relaxed pieces were snipped away, I did not have anything as grand as that on my mind\\\\u2014I only wanted to avoid breakage and split ends. Looking back, I realize that it was a small step in my own character arc.A black woman\\'s hair is serious business. In many African cultures, the time spent styling hair doubles as the time for communal interactions, much like the camaraderie of the salon. When the Atlantic slave trade began, many West Africans had their hair shaved recklessly to avoid lice during the Middle Passage, often leaving their scalps damaged and infected. Forced to abandon their cultures, knowledge of black hair care was not passed down to later generations, who were taught to be ashamed of their \\'unruly\\' textures.As time passed and slavery ended, black people began to embrace their hair, often radically: a withstanding image of black hair is the afro of the 70s\\' \\'Black is Beautiful\\' movement, followed by the braids of the Afrocentric 90s. Today, an array of styles can be seen throughout the black community. More black girls are deciding to go natural, but not without opposition. In 2017, black women still face disdain from employers, educators, and even their own families because of their hair. My first year was not easy. It took hours of trial and error, running water, and sore arms to learn how to wash, moisturize, and style my hair in a way that would keep it healthy. Listening to jibes about my texture and fending off suggestions of relaxing it again only to hear those same people fawn over a family friend for their \\'good\\' hair\\\\u2014long, loose curls or waves\\\\u2014added to that stress.I pushed through. By taking time with my hair in a way that no one else could, I came to know and appreciate this small facet of myself. It is those long, late-night hours spent styling my hair that prove best for self-reflection. There is always a lesson to learn from spending half the day on a hairstyle only for it to fail the next morning. What matters most is that I dare to try; I learn from my mistakes and make another attempt, improving each time.My hair makes up only one portion of my identity and is one of the many methods with which I choose to tell my story. I did not realize it then, but the decision to cut my hair that day was the moment I reclaimed myself. It was an important first step in refusing to modify my self-expression for others, no matter the opposition. Through time spent tending to it, I came to love even the most \\'unruly\\' parts of myself and my cultural heritage. Like my hair, the rest would grow into place. \"}, {\"index\": 240, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I used to read a book a day. I\\'d go to the school library, grab a short book, read it during class\\\\u2014under my desk, much to the ire of my teachers\\\\u2014and return it that afternoon. My imagination was filled with talking mice, aliens, knights, and pretentious children. I mastered the art of reading while walking, reading while talking, reading while eating. I would take the worlds I found in books and bring them into imaginary play. The worlds became my own, and I loved the escapism. In third grade, I discovered the public library. The Phantom Tollbooth, with its whimsical setting and poetic characters, inspired me to write my first, albeit terrible, story. The images and beauty of The Golden Compass entranced me, and soon my dreams were filled with armored bears and warrior witches. Beyond stimulating my creativity, books enriched me. Childhood\\'s End, and most sci-fi for that matter, gave me morality, embedded an anti-authoritarian value in me, and informed my personal beliefs about God as strongly as the Bible did. There was one book that fundamentally changed my worldview. Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes challenged my previous views on issues as real as abortion and suicide, and as conceptual as the nature of religion, society, and personal values. Through empathizing with the characters\\' outsider status and living through their struggles, I became more human. I scorned those who favored their limited plastic screens and valiantly defended my expansive paper pages; that is, until my parents gave me my first computer. The rupture wasn\\'t a drastic cut-off from words, but a slow and sure switch. Why read when you could watch? Why pick up a book when you could scroll? My skills of reading, walking, and eating with a book stayed with me as a phone replaced the novel in my hand. And to further the end of literature, the world became hostile to reading. I was suddenly too old for fantasy and sci- fi. To my peers, Lord of the Rings was cool as long as Peter Jackson was directing it, because who has the time to sit down and focus on one thing at one time? Books are antisocial, your face stuck behind a wall of paper. You should put down that silly nonsense and come have fun. Don\\'t you want to be included? Adults, too, became an enemy of reading. You can\\'t learn anything from a fantasy book. What\\'s the use? It\\'s all made up anyway. Who has the time? You should focus on what matters: school and reality.I read less, watched more. I hadn\\'t completely severed my ties with words. I still read articles, albeit online; read biographies of my heroes, Walt Disney and Jim Henson; and read the books assigned to me by teachers. But to the imaginative worlds of my childhood \\\\u2014 Wonderland, Jordan College, Mars \\\\u2014 I was a stranger.The winter of my junior year, I finished my first fiction book in over three years: The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury. Sure, it was a collection of short stories and not a complete narrative, but when reading and immersing myself in a world where celestial blue orbs are God and rockets full of Edgar Allen Poe\\'s creations ricochet through the sky, I was entranced. I never realized I had stopped reading, and it was not until the final word of the book that the realization dawned on me. I had destroyed what was once the greatest aspect of my personality, and I long more than anything to gain it back. Now, on my bedside table there sits a stack of five or six books, each brimming and pulsating with imaginative stories and beautiful worlds. With limited time between schoolwork and activities, reading these is no easy objective, but I attack it with glee, for I may finally return home to the pages and worlds of which I was born.\"}, {\"index\": 241, \"new_personal_statement\": \"With the recent presidential impeachment and the aggravating tension with North Korea, I am a bystander to a turbulent time in modern Korean political history, watching my country walk down a misty road that leads to unknown ends. As a Korean student, my desire to study History, Politics, and International Relations, represents my passion to understand what shaped my country throughout continued internal and external peril.Based on my interest in modern history and politics, I was particularly attracted to the study of imperialism in AP World History. Specifically, by comparing the development of Japan, China, and the Ottoman Empire during the mid-1800s, I was able to understand how western influences changed the regional power dynamics of Asia; how modernization of government institutions, along with advancements in military structure, transportation, and communication, allowed Meiji Japan to grow as an imperial power while other industrialized nations colonized the former great powers of China and the Ottoman Empire. Compared to the way my previous history classes were colored with nationalistic bias - emphasizing the struggles of the colonized states, especially Korea - my AP class allowed me to view the history of East Asia with a broader perspective, helping me understand the specific ways how modernization shaped the colonial and postcolonial world order. As an extension of my interest in historical and political development, I began subscribing to foreign policy journals such as \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018The Diplomat\\' and \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Foreign Policy.\\' A set of articles focusing on the Middle East intrigued me, about how the Obama administration - wishing for a secular, pro-western Syria whilst disregarding the intense religio-political competition between rebel groups - failed to understand the dynamics of Syria and delivered arms to any militants who the US deemed \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018moderate.\\' Viewing the crisis being mishandled by the \\'passivity and abandonment\\' of the western states, I realized the importance of a multidimensional approach to politics: that a political decision should not be determined only within the realms of government, but should also consider the cultural, religious and historical aspects of the region.These perspectives that I acquired in an academic context were bolstered through a wide range of extracurricular activities. For example, by being selected as a full-scholarship national representative at the Global Classrooms International Model UN in New York, I was able to learn the importance of conventional country-to-country interactions, specifically by successfully mediating different stakeholders at the Security Council and establishing a nonproliferation initiative in North Korea modeled after the Iranian JCPOA. Furthermore, by serving as a full-time intern at Better World, an NGO focusing on international development, I was able to experience the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018micro\\' side of international relations. By supporting Samsung\\'s Corporate Social Responsibility projects, I was not only able to make IT education for underprivileged kids in Vietnam and Peru come true, but I also realized the necessity of the non-government sector in attaining international development agendas. Being able to develop a solution for these international issues fascinated me and is the driving force of my eagerness to study international relations, to advance my knowledge from those of a high school student to an advanced level.I wish to study in the UK to better understand how Britain and Europe developed in the midst of foreign and internal crises, just like the struggles East Asia and the world is dealing with at this moment. I am confident that studying in the UK - the birthplace of the industrial revolution and a diverse country consisting of people from around the world - will not only provide me fresh insights about global politics and history, but will also help me in drawing a \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018bigger picture,\\' for finding the solutions to the problems our world has to solve.\"}, {\"index\": 242, \"new_personal_statement\": \" On the 16th of December 2014, Peshawar was a muted, unfamiliar version of itself.

It was the day when we watched our television sets with blood in our eyes and tears on our cheeks. It was the day we saw fathers bury their children and mothers scream to the heavens. It was the day when 133 children and 13 educationists went to school, but never returned. Terrorists had struck right through the heart of this nation, broadly resilient despite losing 60,000 - soldiers, civilians, young and old - over the previous decade, in our war on terror.That fateful day, my world changed.The next morning, schools including mine were shut down for 24 days. When we returned, all students were made to practice evacuation drills in case a similar terrorist attack happened at our school. My friends and I would shiver in the cold and unwittingly shrug at the pointlessness of these drills. If those eight gunmen came to our school with fully automatic assault rifles, what good would assembling in the soccer ground do? We would anxiously look at our school\\'s roof where four snipers took up their posts throughout the day. We saw our school walls transform into prison-like boundaries. We were repeatedly reassured that these security measures would protect us. For me, it inculcated fear.The days, weeks, and months that followed APS exhibited everything that I would not want for the next generation to endure. Having experienced such an ordeal, I vowed that in my pursuit of a meaningful and worthy life, I would strive to address the menace of extremism and intolerance that leads to terror.Having had the good fortune of extensive travel, I had never before observed suspicion. However, as I gained consciousness and learned to become wary of my surroundings, I noticed that my very name, color, religion and passport drew focus at airports. Was I also a \\'person of interest\\'? Then it dawned on me - I, too, through extension, might often be expected to apologize for and explain terrorism. This, for the second time, inculcated fear.I began to appreciate the perspective of those unwittingly caught in the middle of a firefight, like Zubair Rehman, whose family and village was caught between the Taliban and humming drones, who said, to the United States Congress, \\'I no longer love blue skies. I prefer gray skies. The drones do not fly when the skies are gray and, for a short period of time, the mental tension and fear ease. But when the sky brightens, the drones return. And so does the fear\\'.All nations want to help Rehman and his family and the thousands of others like him. Extremism is condemned unanimously; promises and commitments are made to work toward solutions. Yet we see none that work. Is the current modus operandi a step in the right direction? Global \\\\u2013 not national \\\\u2013 citizenship is on the horizon through transformational technology advances and a new information age. Why then, are nation-states fearful of working earnestly with one another? We should be seeing humanity coming together to eradicate the menace that is all forms of terror. Instead, we are seeing trends, like protectionism through exclusion, bigotry, and \\'building walls\\', catching tailwind. We surely have no place for levels of fragmentation and fracture, the sermons of which were preached in a realm that Hitler envisioned.Our shared world needs meaningful, cogent and inclusive solutions; not fear. Through active, progressive, and informed contribution to the discussion, I seek to partner in the change I desire to see.\"}, {\"index\": 243, \"new_personal_statement\": \"My parents have always struggled with English. As a kid, I always thought it was because they didn\\'t watch Dora the Explorer. Yes, that little girl and her anthropomorphic friends were my Rosetta Stone. Born in Cuba, I was deeply engrossed in the culture: I landed in America still singing \\'Guajiro Natural,\\' a song symbolic of Cuban farmer culture. Learning the English language was the first step in my metamorphosis, and Dora was largely responsible for teaching me.Once I became old enough to go to school, my parents were pressured by their friends to put me in an ESL class so I\\'d be able to adapt more easily. Afraid I\\'d never fully embrace the English language, they instead thrust me into a kindergarten class where no one ever spoke Spanish. I remember that class fondly, with Ms. Cruz teaching me how to rhyme words like \\'bat\\' and \\'cat,\\' and an end-of-year dance party with dozens of bouncing kids. I had picked up the language easily, as most young children do.I always hated the food at home. Rice, beans, and, depending on what mom decided to cook up, either ground beef, pork ribs, or chicken breast. Blessed were the days when my parents chose to go out to eat at an Italian restaurant or a diner. Pizza, spaghetti, chicken nuggets, french fries: absolute bliss. I was always jealous of my friends who had pasta night every friday, or went out every weekend. McDonald\\'s was a treat. I still salivate over a nice 10-piece McNuggets meal with some fries.At around the age of 8 I ran into another problem. \\'Guajiro Natural\\' just didn\\'t sound so hot anymore. The car radio seemed to be permanently switched to 93.1 Amor, playing what sounded like the same 3 bachata songs on loop, interrupted only by loud, lightning-fast commercials in Spanish selling car insurance or something else an 8-year-old doesn\\'t care about. My friends at school would sing songs in English, songs I\\'d never had the chance to hear. I would constantly ask my dad to change to Z100 so I could hear the greatest hits of the 2000s or to 106.7 lite fm so I could enjoy some Michael Jackson or Cyndi Lauper. My parents weren\\'t big fans of Z100, but my dad would tell stories of dancing to Michael Jackson and mishearing his lyrics back in Cuba: needless to say, I wound up hearing a lot more MJ than Z100. Everything felt better in English: even the commercials sounded good. I wanted to be an American just like all my friends at school, I wanted to fit in. I remember refusing dance lessons from my mom because I didn\\'t want to \\'waste time\\' learning salsa or merengue.I never had the grandma who baked cookies; mine fried plantain chips. We never had meatloaf night; we ate rice and beans almost daily instead. But after returning to Cuba for the first time, seeing my family and my homeland, my thinking changed. At night the adults would all tell jokes and stories, and I was so happy I could understand them. All these amazing people, and I can call them family? My whole life I\\'ve worried about fitting in, scared about how different my culture was. Being different was scary. Only now that I\\'m older do I realize that I should embrace who I am, where I came from. I\\'ve become more and more interested in the Spanish language, constantly asking my parents for new words and explanations of grammar rules. With college on the horizon, I\\'ve actually asked my mom to teach me her recipe for rice and beans, and I might have to enroll in her School of Dance one of these days (which happens to double as our living room). And now that I think about it, \\'Guajiro Natural\\' has a pretty nice ring to it after all.\"}, {\"index\": 244, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Ink-stained canvas. Gentle strokes of color. A smudge of water. The thin paintbrush permits the precise crafting of mountainous terrain. The warm hues fuse together to form the autumn shades of the maple trees, and the water structures a path for the pigments to chase. \\'Paint with grace. Let your fingers do the work,\\' Mrs. Banks, my 4th grade art teacher, suggested as I watched the colors settle into the fibers of my canvas. In elementary school, I had begged my parents for art lessons. As I got older, my newfound interest became the guitar. Soon enough, a telescope and binoculars were added to my arsenal. In my house, I became a fledgling Van Gogh, a rookie Eddie Van Halen, and an aspirant Galileo. As a child, my muse was discovery; I craved finding new methods of expression and creation. Today, I\\'m not much of a painter anymore, but I remain an artist. And my palette is composed of two of my lasting discoveries: filmmaking and computer science.Film first entered my life through sci-fi cinema. As a child, I marveled at the droids that could scavenge plant life in Wall-E, the face scans used to enter Star Trek archives, and the Imperial Star Destroyer schematics in every Star Wars film. The fantasies portrayed in these movies were not tangible in the real world, yet the emotions they evoked were the most palpable.Childhood movies dared me to dream, and videography became my medium for sharing these boundless visions. In 11th grade, I was tasked with creating an infomercial for a competitive event in the Technology Student Association. To make up for our lack of lighting and stabilization equipment, my team spent weeks crafting homemade versions. Days later, the holograms and jetpacks I had prototyped in my mind were brought to life in the form of special effects. The seemingly impossible technologies that were once figments of my imagination became realities portrayed on the screen.In high school, programming became another platform where I could bring these visions to life. How could machine learning be used to identify allergens contained in food using only a photograph? Could software provide a platform for local restaurants to reduce food wastage? How could gesture recognition transform the human body into an instrument? Each and every keystroke at Hackathons brought me closer to developing solutions to these complex questions. And while the final results\\\\u2014programs that achieved these lofty goals \\\\u2014were fulfilling, the process itself was most enticing. I find myself zipping through documentation, constantly absorbing new algorithms, and spending endless hours meticulously debugging code. Programming is a constant challenge to the mind, forcing creative and efficient thought, and testing how far I can stretch my limits. Having a foot in both realms has shaped my perspective. As I\\'m lost in a maelstrom of program failures from an app I\\'m working on late at night, I funnel the resourcefulness I\\'ve acquired through long hours on the film set. As I deliberate the shot composition for the next scene of a video, I balance ambition with the logic and pragmatism I attained through coding. Whether I am producing a promotional video for a client or designing a new software, I continue to channel my newfound mentality in all aspects of my life. Fumbling between activities as a child led to discovering my love for film and computer science, and my childlike delight lingers today. Film will likely remain a hobby for years to come, while continuing to shape how I approach my career in computer science. Yet, even as I dabble in both crafts, I realize that balancing the technical with the creative, the left brain with the right, is an art form that I have yet to master. College is where I will refine this harmony, armed with my camera in one hand and my computer the other.spoke with panache: \\'What if we compete in the Verizon App Challenge? The winning organization gets sponsored!\\'. As Outreach Captain of my Robotics team, I saw this competition as an opportunity to raise funds for purchasing robot-parts and machinery.The rules of the contest were simple: in a team of six, design an application to address a social issue. After reading an article claiming that $115,000,000 was raised for ALS research through the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, I asked my team....what if we designed a platform for organizations to create challenges that generate research capital for underfunded diseases?To validate the idea, I conducted surveys with hospital workers, pitched the concept to orphan-disease organizations through LinkedIn, and interviewed medical-research students. Sharing this topic at length cultivated mass support for our cause and even brought forth a new awareness to our community on these underfunded illnesses. In the end, our app (viewable at scioapp.com) placed 1st in NJ, winning $5000 that helped my robotics team finance a CNC router which accelerates our metal-carving process.The money also enabled us to build an additional practice robot, but with 110 students on the team, my teammates still complained about not getting enough hands-on time. To allow my peers to pursue engineering projects with more independence, I co-founded a chapter of the Technology Student Association (TSA). While the TSA club complimented the Robotics experience of many, it also encouraged newcomers to partake in STEM fields. As President, I helped recruit 83 members and guided them through their projects, of which 12 out of the 19 placed in the Top 3 at the NJ TSA State Competition.Through these experiences, I\\'ve learned the impact mentors have on leaders. My team wouldn\\'t have made necessary adjustments to our app design had we not asked our local community for advice. The TSA club wouldn\\'t have gained as much traction without the marketing advice from my robotics advisor. Leadership is just as much asking for help to better one\\'s self as it is providing it. Today, I\\'m a better leader because of it.As a child, Star Wars films stole my imagination. These movies dared me to dream, but today, my visions aren\\'t restricted to my dreams. As a filmmaker, I bring them to life.Filmmaking has molded me into a visual storyteller. Through writing screenplays, directing shots, and editing scenes, I\\'ve learned how to effectively convey my visions to changing audiences. When I film documentaries for my robotics team or direct commercials for my school\\'s Technology Student Association, I\\'ve learned how to use engaging animations and special effects to bring mundane information to life. While filming Drake music-video parodies and editing childhood-wedding montages for cousins, I\\'ve learned how to create humor with quirky sound-effects and transitions. Through these pursuits, I\\'ve gained perspective; I can now tailor my work to meet the needs of different types of people.Over the years, I\\'ve learned to supplement my values as a filmmaker in other pursuits of my life, especially programming. When I\\'m lost in a maelstrom of code failures from an app I\\'m working on late at night, I funnel the resourcefulness I\\'ve acquired through long hours on the film-set to sift through documentation for a solution.On the flip side, I\\'ve learned to apply my experiences as a programmer to solve challenges on the film-set. Once, I created a remote shutter-release for my DSLR using transistors, opto-isolators, and an Arduino board. The device allowed me to wirelessly trigger my camera, enabling me to record and act on screen, simultaneously.I continue to channel my filmmaking ambition when I work as an app-entrepreneur. Everytime I release an app onto the market, I produce a promotional video to accompany it. By altering the music, pacing, and inflection in these marketing videos, I can evoke the emotions I want my consumers to experience. These videos have contributed to the $2860 I\\'ve made thus far with my apps. To me, creativity is about harnessing the connections between two seemingly-distinct fields. It\\'s about fusing my technical side with my artistic side, programming with filmmaking, my left brain with my right. With both, my creativity thrives.My mind escaped into hyperspace, contemplating the possibilities...could food allergens be detected using image processing? Could I transform my body into a musical instrument using gesture recognition? Competing at Hackathons over the past four years has enabled me to develop softwares to answer these exact questions. As I facilitated coding sessions with my teammates, not only did I develop an avant-garde mindset by creating workarounds for technical limitations, but I also learned how to articulate my visions while demoing our projects to judges.To further my programming experience in a traditional work-environment, I interned as an Android Developer this past summer at Ello, a social networking company. After 8 weeks of writing unit tests, helping the C.T.O. frame project timelines, and voicing my ideas at team-meetings, I realized that software engineers are more than just programmers; they also need to exhibit leadership and communication abilities\\\\u2014 skills I\\'ve acquired through leading my school\\'s Robotics team and Technology Student Association chapter.To foster more independence in my technical-work, I\\'ve pursued various personal projects. Some of these include a smart-mirror that notifies me of news headlines every morning (viewable at www.sahit.me/mirror) and a student planner app used by over 10,200 students (viewable at www.sahit.me/mygenda).One project, an interactive game teaching children the inner workings of gears, won me an all-expense-paid scholarship to attend Apple\\'s Worldwide Developer Conference. There, listening to Apple Executive Ester Hare\\'s presentation on product expansion, I realized the ethical responsibilities of programmers \\\\u2013 to always consider a product\\'s potential negative societal consequences in addition to the positive. Attending coding workshops with Apple Engineers taught me to create accessible software that can be used by the disabled and non-english speaking populations. Acknowledging my learning, Apple featured my app Glimpse, a tool that narrates objects aloud for the visually impaired, on the homepage of the iOS App Store, ranking it in the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Top 100 Utility Apps\\' section in 3 countries.In college, I will continue developing my programming abilities, armed with a mouse in one hand and a keyboard the other.Lera Beroditsky\\'s recent TED Talk on foreign languages reminded me of a phenomenon I\\'ve pondered many times before: do humans decipher language the same way computers do?To explore this topic, I\\'ve been studying Spanish in the classroom for the past 10 years, supplementing it with online Duolingo and edX classes. As part of my school\\'s Spanish Honor Society, I helped set up a World-Language Night, an evening filled with performances and food from foreign countries. After experiencing the culture and interacting with native Spanish speakers, I greatly advanced my ability to converse in Spanish.Yet, my greatest understanding of the language came when I began tutoring Edison at A2Z Mentoring, a local nonprofit that aids underserved families. Edison and I connected over our complementary missions \\\\u2014 he aimed to learn English after recently moving from Spain to the U.S. while I wished to further explore Spanish. Edison introduced me to new expressions and slang that couldn\\'t be found in textbooks, and every week, I taught him English through a self-designed curriculum. After Edison told me at the end of one of our tutoring sessions that he didn\\'t have any computers at home, I offered to let him play an iPhone game I had coded. After noticing his curiosity for how I programmed the game, I started Project Code, an initiative to teach coding classes to underrepresented students (www.projectcode.live). Teaching coding principles to over 150 students who, like Edison, spoke minimal English, required me to overcome language barriers by incorporating visuals so that the lessons were universally understood.Holding these coding sessions and learning the Spanish language prompted a realization. Computers can be taught to interpret human-language in ways very similar to how humans learn foreign languages. It\\'s a matter of forming connections between words, analyzing speech-patterns, dissecting intent in statements, and evaluating the emotion behind a person\\'s words.In college, I wish to study the intersection of computer-language and human-language through a major in Computer Science and a minor in Linguistics, creating a foundation for my work with natural language processing and artificial intelligence in the future.\"}, {\"index\": 245, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Braces!\\' a voice cries out. I smile warmly as I confusedly try to discover the speaker. Only one person I know would welcome me in such a way.When I returned to Fresh and Green Academy last summer in Ethiopia, my face was still recognizable by one of the students I had taught prior to then\\\\u2014even without my awkward braces. The summer before entering high school, however, did not bring as gracious a welcome. Initially, I was ecstatic to be back where my mother grew up, a place that was meant to be home. While I was eager to dig into the siga-wot (lamb stew) that my grandma had prepared upon my arrival, each piece I scooped up with injera\\\\u2014a traditional delicacy\\\\u2014 left a bitter aftertaste, unlike the one I was used to at home. The bits of Amharic I had gleaned from my mother and aunts\\' discussions back home were lost in the conversations of my relatives and locals. What I knew, it seemed, only formed a small thread within the cloth of Ethiopian culture.Upon walking through the flimsy tin gate of the school, dozens of nameless faces scrutinized my every step, their uncertain gazes unwavering as they wondered what to make of the stranger that had infiltrated their home. I was an outsider, even with my heritage: at best, another member from the diaspora\\\\u2014 at worst, a complete foreigner.Despite my shortcomings in connecting to cuisine or language, still, I was determined to connect with the people; yet, over the next two months, I soon learned that teaching was not for the faint of heart. Attempts to break up arguments nearly always lead to tears being shed. Chasing down students to get to class meant someone else had an opportunity to sneak out of the classroom while I was away. Games of after-school soccer often left me trying to catch my breath from running in circles around the schoolyard.My difficulty adjusting gave way to a new sense of isolation; but as it turned out, I was not alone in being alone. Yacob, a schoolboy from the countryside, unfamiliar with Addis dialect, would stay inside by himself waiting for the time to pass while other students outside flew across the yard. \\'Inihidi,\\' I reminded him one day, using one of the few words we shared to challenge both of us to \\'go\\' break out of our isolation and join a game of soccer alongside the other kids. During class, when I decided to place students in pairs, he and others were able to get along as they worked together to solve math problems up on the blackboard\\\\u2014language could not bar their collaboration. Whenever my mouth opened to take a bite of injera during lunch, Yacob pointed, mesmerized by the sparkling metal grid arrayed across my teeth, the likes of which he had never before seen. The name \\'Braces,\\' as I told him they were called, seemed to roll off his tongue whenever he spotted me. Both of us, it seemed, were getting used to something new.While I will never forgot the bonds I created with the students that summer, I will always treasure my memories with Yacob. Finding my place as an Ethiopian was about forming true connections that manifest not from our cultures but our shared human experiences. Loneliness, frustration, excitement\\\\u2014these we share regardless of our background . It was this knowledge that later contributed to my connection to the other students. On one of the last days of that first summer, as I turned to exit the school through the same tin gates I had once entered, one of the teachers asked me to stay a little while longer: \\'The kids want you to teach my class instead!\\' Now, I belonged.\"}, {\"index\": 246, \"new_personal_statement\": \"On an airplane, the mother of a nauseous boy is calling for an inattentive flight attendant. Looking at this scene from above, I was tasked with describing this scene as a story in American Sign Language (ASL). I had a minute to create a story that would show key linguistic elements \\\\u2013 including contrastive structure and interpretive classifiers. In that one minute, I came up with this: the boy just felt some motion sickness. In the flight attendant\\'s distraction, though, the boy regurgitated, and the trajectory resulted in the discharge landing on the passenger sitting one seat ahead of him. The passenger dropped his briefcase, which spilled open to reveal stacks of hundred dollar bills. The man next to him who was reading the newspaper, had read of a burglary in a bank less than a mile away from the airport. He whipped out his badge and handcuffs (for he was actually an air marshal) and promptly arrested the man. This story was what I used for my sophomore year ASL final, signed to an unfamiliar grader, which was probably risky. It was worth it, though, because I followed my own values, and signed something creative and worthwhile. As a high school student, exposed to numerous subjects at once, I\\'ve learned that each field of study has themes. The central dogma and evolution are ubiquitous in biology. Causal relationships and societal values are universal in history. Basic functions and slope are omnipresent in calculus. Science helps us understand the ways the world works. History helps us apply the past to the present and future. Math helps us model and quantify the world. Languages allow us communicate with others; however, language is not merely used to convey information. It\\'s used to excite through the expression of ideas.

Overcome by a looming sense of loss and powerlessness, I barely heard my parents as they explained that my father was offered a job in California. Unfortunately, due to my mom\\'s work permit restriction, the rest of the family have to stay behind in Massachusetts. As I watched my father board the plane, I felt tears welling in my eyes. My parents had put me in my grandparents\\' hands as they ventured to the United States when I was one, and I only met them later on. After experiencing the joy of living with them, it hurt to lose my father so soon.Following the separation, I saw my mom\\'s mood decline as she entered a state of constant exhaustion. Apart from her full-time job and household chores, she had to care for my five-year-old brother and me. Noticing her fatigue, I started to bother her less, hoping to lighten the weight on her shoulders. I began to bike to and from school so that she didn\\'t need to drive me. I would return home to an empty house, sweaty and tired, and do my chores so the house would be cleaner when my mom came home.It was then that, to make my evenings more fun, I started to use these chores as an outlet for my creativity. When I vacuumed, I blasted electronic dance music and imagined myself as deadmau5, turning the living room into my stage and the vacuum into my mixer. I did the same when my mom wasn\\'t home, and I cooked dinner for my brother and myself. Then, the kitchen transformed into a laboratory for my mad scientist ideas. I meticulously measured a medley of ingredients with cups and balances, pouring them into a boiling cauldron of noodles. My brother learned to live with my infamous \\'Mystery Noodles,\\' which had ingredients ranging from apple cider to chocolate bars, though my learning process was not without failure. Once, as a fearless pre-teen eager to try out some habanero powder I found in a cabinet, I scooped a generous spoonful into the soup. I spent the rest of that night on the toilet regretting my decision, but that was the price to pay for the joy that I got from my inventive cooking.Exercising my creativity was an unexpected consequence of spending time by myself, but it stuck with me as I translated it to other environments, transforming all tasks into adventures. One of these tasks was doing my math homework. Every time I opened my math book, I entered a world where I was the hero, and each math problem was an evil villain. I slashed fiercely with my pencil, following the technique of powerful formulas, and each solved problem was a small victory against my loneliness. I soon developed a true passion for math and found that the imaginary worlds I fabricated were not enough to fulfill me. I itched to leave the house to attend Mathcounts club meetings, and I would be excited for Fridays afternoons almost exclusively because that\\'s when they took place. Those meetings were spent in deep thinking, laughter, and friendly competitions. I lacked this kind of easy rapport and collaboration at home, and the rarity of the meetings fed my desire to work alongside others. I wished I could have spent more time there, because I realized how much my peers\\' help and company expanded my mind.I have come to understand that the circumstances I grew up in have shaped me into someone more creative and resourceful than I would have been otherwise. Today, with my dad back in our home, I continue to excel at collaboration and creativity. I feel a deep gratitude toward the sacrifice my parents have made for me, and I look forward to a future with many more academic challenges.Snuggled in the south side of my high school is the band room. Walking by it, one hears the clicking of two drumsticks colliding and a man repeatedly shouting the phrase \\'ta-ka-di-mi\\' over the mistimed entrances and cracked notes of a practicing ensemble. To the inexperienced ear, the sounds create an unappealing portrayal of what happens there. However, as a trumpeter in multiple ensembles at school, I have spent a large chunk of time in the room with its inhabitant, and see it in a different light.From the inside it is quite charming, with turquoise and beige walls curving out from the conductor and windows surrounding it thirty feet in the air, like angels. However, the musical experiments happening there are what truly add to its beauty. My band director always encourages us to try different ways of shaping music until we find the perfect fit \\\\u2013 although it is also true that when forty musicians play different styles at once the combined result can be overwhelming. Regardless, Wind Ensemble has always been where I could forget about work and let my creativity out.One afternoon, I walked into band class exhausted from a morning of exams. I slumped in my seat, took out my trumpet, and started buzzing with my mouthpiece. In my mind, I could not stop rehearsing history facts in preparation for a test I had the following block. As the band quieted down, my music teacher stepped onto the podium and said:\\'Today, Eugene will lead warm-up.\\'With no strength to argue, I trudged to the front of the class and turned towards the ensemble. Suddenly, fear gripped my senses and locked my emotions away. When I started conducting, the black and white music thumped lifelessly against the colorful walls.Over the ensuing weeks, the class became my testing ground. As soon as the band settled down, my band director called me to the front of the class to conduct the warm-up. He had seen something in me that I didn\\'t know existed, and he persisted in breaking down the introverted shell that I had mistaken for my core. Eventually, it came apart. One day, having been in exams for hours and feeling emotional, I let go of the caution that, without myself realizing, had been constraining my conducting. The music flared in color. I looked over at my music director and was met by a huge smile that stretched across his face. I felt a new kind of joy as I let go of my restraint and expanded my movements, the music following suit. With my newfound confidence, I set out to make my high school experience more enjoyable. I decided to run for class office, since the events that were routinely planned had dismal attendance and worsened our already minimal school spirit. When I gave my class officer speech, I summoned the strength to let my walls down and spoke with intent. Although I lost that election, I won something more valuable: the courage to let my walls down and grasp the full gamut of my emotional ability, which has later allowed me to take more initiative in pursuing my goals.\"}, {\"index\": 248, \"new_personal_statement\": \"There are 102 seats in my high school theater, and freshman year I was determined to sit in the farthest one from the stage \\\\u2014 seat G1 in the back left corner. It seemed to be the safest hiding place for me, a completely inexperienced member of costume and makeup crew. Still, I couldn\\'t escape hearing my teacher\\'s notes to the actors. \\'What\\'s your character\\'s motivation?\\' she would ask nightly after rehearsal. Why did they move that way or emphasize that word? Can you hint at their backstory? The performers, all upperclassmen who sat as close to the front as possible (A10-A5, B10-B5), would nod and push together their eyebrows, apparently absorbing those questions and vowing to seek some elusive connection with their character. Several rows behind them, I would rest my chin on my palm and get lost in other thoughts, wondering if I would ever worry that much about people\\'s backstories, fictional or otherwise.My detachment was chipped away by nine more shows throughout my freshman and sophomore years, most notably the last one: an election-themed, modern version of Hamlet in the spring of 2016. The timing, cast and crew were all perfect, but I was next up to be costume designer and still felt underprepared. Though I wasn\\'t inexperienced anymore, I had never been faced with skillfully decoding such an iconic piece of literature, nor had I ever had so many people invested in the result.But somewhere in between watching read-throughs, planning quick changes and mapping out the costumes on a spreadsheet (a type-A strategy that I\\'m still proud of today), something clicked. I realized that every moment in that 4,000-line play had to be analyzed with respect to the characters\\' personalities and feelings, as well as how these traits affected their style and actions: Would Claudius get his suit personally tailored? Of course. What\\'s Ophelia\\'s signature color? Red \\\\u2014 she needs attention and a little unsettling foreshadowing. And can we please get Hamlet out of those acid wash jeans? He\\'s tragic but not obnoxious. Those moments opened up a whole new kind of learning for me: one that involved not just academic success, but emotional intelligence.Outside the high walls of my school\\'s black box theatre, my underclassmen years let me explore another passion: journalism. Tenth grade had been my first year as news editor for my school paper, and though the articles I wrote were solid, I didn\\'t connect with them on any deep, critical level. When I started my junior year a few months after that critical first gig as costume designer, I found that my approach to reporting was more comprehensive. When I interviewed people for stories in my junior year, I recognized they had their own lives outside of what I wrote about them, and their backgrounds were all inseparable from the stories they shared with me. I wanted to understand how they truly felt \\\\u2014 the dissatisfied parents, the kids who got parking tickets, the undocumented families. I wanted to hear \\'both sides,\\' out of a mixture of journalistic integrity and pure curiosity. Just as my drama teacher had always recommended, I wanted to know their motivation. Reporting in this way will never cease to excite me, and has led me to pursuing journalism as a career. For that reason, I\\'ll always be grateful for the high school play that helped me realize the power of people\\'s words and my ability to understand them.I still don\\'t sit in the front row of my theater, and I probably never will \\\\u2014 it\\'s never been my tendency to settle that close to the spotlight. But I\\'ll always be just a few seats back, watching a story unfold on a stage, and searching for its truth.I started backstage theatre work as an excited but inexperienced freshman on costume and makeup crew. My disorientation was eventually lessened with nine more shows during my underclassman years, a period during which I was promoted from crew member to makeup designer to, finally, costume designer. I\\'ll admit that this initial rise was more due to quick dedication, reliability and attention to detail than artistic skill; a less kind critic might describe it as an instance of \\'fake it \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018til you make it.\\' The real turning point came at the end of my sophomore year: a politically-charged, modern day version of Hamlet, which my first show as costume designer. Between watching read-throughs and planning quick changes and mapping out outfits on a spreadsheet (a type-A strategy that I\\'m still proud of today), something clicked. I realized that every moment in that 4,000-line play had to be analyzed with respect to the characters\\' personalities and feelings, as well as how these traits affected their style and actions: Would Claudius get his suit personally tailored? Of course. What\\'s Ophelia\\'s signature color? Red, she needs attention and a little violent foreshadowing. And can we please get Hamlet out of those acid wash jeans? He\\'s tragic but not obnoxious.This strategy of actively placing myself in each character\\'s shoes has shaped the rest of my work in theatre and beyond. After Hamlet, I began to see theatre differently. It\\'s not just a hobby - it\\'s an all-in-one, microcosmic crash course on everything from history to literature analysis to audio-visuals to interpretations of life itself. As a costume designer, my work has the potential to profoundly influence or manipulate the audience\\'s perception of each character. Moreover, the emotional intelligence I have gained from critically reading these stories has made me a more empathetic person, not to mention a more analytical writer and journalist. Costume design has not only opened my eyes to the world of theatre arts, but also allowed me to explore the human condition through a countless variety of lenses and outfits.I joined my school paper expecting to cover school art galleries and soccer tournaments, but I quickly found that my strong suit was hard news. My first experiences as a political correspondent were to the district school board in my freshman year. I found that I got a kick out of covering politics in any capacity, even if it was just a simple partisan split among five local representatives. By the end of my freshman year, I was promoted to News Editor. The skills I gained in this field - interviewing officials and writing professional pieces - helped me in my junior year, when I joined an online youth publication called \"}, {\"index\": 249, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Prompt: Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story. (note: names have been changed)One of the downsides of being the last stop on the morning bus route is that there will never be an open seat. Let me tell you\\\\u2014 having to scurry down the aisle, trying to make friendly eye contact with random people in hopes that one will allow me to sit with them, is not worth the extra twenty minutes of sleep. On the fateful morning of the first day of my freshman year, I entered the bus and was greeted by dead silence. I made my way through the aisle, maneuvering around hanging feet and backpacks, hoping that someone would offer me a seat, but the rows of unresponsive, sleeping and texting students offered me no solace. Defeated, I turned around when a boy sitting in the front row stood up, smiled at me, and said, \\'you can sit with me.\\' I recognized him from middle school. He was never in the same classes as me and I barely knew him at all, except that his name was Aiden and he had autism. To be honest, I never fully understood what autism was before then. Sure, I was taught it was a condition that affected communication and interaction, but nobody I had known was knew until that point was autistic. I had no connection to this community, so I never experienced that interaction until I started sitting with Aiden on the route to school every morning. Admittedly, I initially felt embarrassed. The repetitive sounds and actions Aiden would say or make prompted many head turns and empty stares by students sitting around us. I felt their contempt, their mockery, their misunderstandings\\\\u2014 things Aiden couldn\\'t see, but I could. Blinded by their judgment, I almost failed to recognize Aiden\\'s kindness towards me. But as weeks flew by and Aiden\\'s presence integrated into my morning routine, outside opinion became trivial. Instead, each forty-five minute bus ride became less of a social burden, and more of a reminder of selfless compassion: that every day Aiden reserved a seat just for me. But most importantly, sitting with Aiden gave me a sense of initiative. I felt empowered to make an impact on the community, to stand up for justice, and to change the minds of people who once looked at the different with scorn. Last year, I wrote an article for the school newspaper about the special education program at our school, which Aiden was a part of. As I talked to the program director, visited the classrooms, and saw how these students learn and interact with their teachers, I began to see a community linked not so much by disability, but by compassion and dedication. Additionally, through the club \"}, {\"index\": 250, \"new_personal_statement\": \"With a loud bang, my mom rushes through the door and beelines to the kitchen. As the only adult in the house, she is solely responsible for dinner, rapidly chopping carrots and onions. I pause tinkering with my Lego roller coaster to help her wash and cut more vegetables, while she deftly assembles the ingredients into oxtail soup.With four hands, our mandatory family dinner is ready just in time before I\\'m whisked away to evening activities.As I grew older, I upgraded my Legos to Arduinos but continued to play the role of chef. One particularly lazy day, I longed to cook our favorite oxtail soup in a new slow-cooker but knew that I would forget the precise five-hour cooking time. I put my tinkering to use, fashioning my Arduino and a few household parts into a timer for the slow- cooker\\'s outlet. My mom brightened when she saw the makeshift contraption, extending it to hassle-free rice porridges and beef stews. As we ate these perfectly timed dishes, I tasted the savory satisfaction of solving problems with technology.My propensity to tinker thrived through sophomore year when I jumped at an opportunity to join a college hackathon, hoping to investigate problems beyond my kitchen. My team agreed on my high school\\'s most pressing issue: lack of collaboration. Students often discussed creative innovations but struggled to find teammates and mentors to get started. Just as with the slow-cooker, I turned to technology to tackle this problem.I sought out hackathon mentors to learn UX/UI design and attended workshops to explore web-development frameworks. My team eventually developed SchoolGround, a web-app for finding teammates with diverse skillsets.Filled with excitement from creating SchoolGround out of nothing, I spent the next few weeks surveying my school\\'s student body for feedback. However, I discovered that my web-app didn\\'t make supportive groups for teammates to work together, it only enhanced the process. This seemed like a need that technology couldn\\'t solve, no matter how many features I added. I remembered my college hackathon experience\\\\u2014it was the people and dynamics that enabled me to bring my ideas to life. Something clicked in my mind. I needed to approach the collaboration problem from a different angle: the social side. And I couldn\\'t think of anything better than providing a hackathon dedicated to high schoolers.I launched Hack New England High Schools (hackNEHS) and enlisted like-minded peers to join the organizing team. Through countless Skype calls to prepare for the event, I shifted our focus from typical talk of purchasing Arduinos to socially-focused considerations. I pinpointed the Microsoft conference center for our venue, impressed by its open spaces and round tables that encouraged discussion. With beginners in mind, I planned in-hackathon workshops, from learning web-development to data visualization. I secured Catapult Incubator as a sponsor to provide mentorship and grants for winning teams continuing their projects. I was nervous we hadn\\'t provided enough pajamas and Soylent\\\\u2014essential elements for brainstorming sessions\\\\u2014when hundreds of participants showed up at the venue. It was soon dispelled as teams sketched out flowcharts on every open whiteboard while our Ideation Workshop quickly reached max-capacity. Gathering a group of mentors, I dashed around to address raised hands.The venue came alive during the final presentations as teams demonstrated projects ranging from ping-pong VR games to study music generators. Afterwards, I was thrilled when students from my school came up to me seeking advice to continue their projects and maintain their team beyond the hackathon. I was convinced that I had achieved my personal goal of helping my school develop that collaborative spirit. I also saw people I didn\\'t know before\\\\u2014new friends\\\\u2014pitching to each other while sharing pizza. This enthusiasm reminded me that I needed to think beyond technology to solve social problems. More importantly, I realized that helping my mom in the kitchen or making an impact in my community gave me real joy.\"}, {\"index\": 251, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The barrage of reciprocative outcries coming from downstairs woke me up violently. Oh no, not again. I clambered out of bed and stumbled towards the family room. Sprinting down the stairs, I found my mom screaming desperately at my frenzied dad, the beer bottles scattered across the floor decidedly confirming my suspicions. I rushed in, straining with what little might I had to push them apart and lead my mom away.At ten years old, I learned to associate dad and beer with mom and yelling. It upset me to see my mom distressed, and I wanted to assuage her unremitting pain. I pleaded with my dad to stop drinking, but he simply chuckled and patted me on the head, assuring me that I was too young to understand. Glancing over at my mom, who sat silently with her lips pursed and her eyes cast down at the coffee table, I opened my mouth to argue, only to find I didn\\'t know what else to say.Throughout middle school, I devoured any research or news related to drinking, most of which determined alcohol consumption was harmful. The evidence and my confidence mounted, culminating in a presentation in which I laid out the body of literature in front of my dad and requested that he seriously consider cutting back on his drinking\\\\u2014 this time without my mom in the room for fear of instigating the habitual argument between them. He conceded that his drinking was indeed an issue and agreed to stop once and for all. \\'Mom will be so happy to hear this. Thanks, dad. I love you,\\' I said with my face buried in his chest and my arms wrapped around his waist.I would\\'ve loved to end the story right then and there, but alas, that wasn\\'t the case. Months passed and he made no visible attempt to change his habits in spite of my persistence. I came to realize that simply convincing him drinking was harmful wasn\\'t going to flip a switch and galvanize him into action. Empirical evidence and logical reasoning were fundamental to my argument, but I would need to tap into his emotions if I wanted to inspire him to act out his promises.A few weeks prior to his 50th birthday, I decided this source of inspiration would come in the form of a gift. After all, this unceremonious transition into old age naturally prompts a reassessment of one\\'s health. I recruited my melodramatic little sister to help me design and film a comedic mini-movie advocating a healthy lifestyle and specifically denouncing alcohol as a threat to one\\'s well-being. The product? A series of skits that involved me performing sumo squats with ten-pound dumbbells and my sister hurling beer bottles into the trash can.On the night of his birthday, I scrambled back from my room to the coffee table, fumbling my MacBook between my hands and running every possible ending to the story in my mind. Would I finally be the hero or was I doomed to fail again?I clicked the play button with a trembling pointer finger, and almost immediately, my dad launched into a peal of roaring laughter that slowly abated as he pieced together the underlying message. As the progress bar inched towards the right edge of the screen, he turned to face us, an unmistakable look of conviction in his eyes.Pulling me into his embrace, he patted me on the back and whispered into my ear over and over that I was right all along. I turned to look at my mom, my gaze meeting hers, and the tears she fought so hard to hold back began to trickle down her cheeks, liberated at last.\"}, {\"index\": 252, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Prompt: Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story. Everyone has a happy place.I ran to my closet and slid down the wall. My sweat coagulated with dust as I closed the door and found myself in darkness. I heard a faint, wood-splintering invasion at my door and a pounding in my heart.  Inhale. One, two, three. Exhale. Go to your happy place.Mine used to be some anonymous beach, one that would probably appear in a glossy brochure for Aruba. Upon each visit, it became more decayed from the last. Its white shores became splotched with wildlife victimized by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, its lightly salted air thickened with tense diplomatic relations, its wispy, clear horizons threatened with nuclear warfare. Eventually, my \\'happy place\\' became an ironic and unwelcome reminder of precisely everything about the world that I wanted to escape. In a time when the motifs of my life were slammed doors and police disturbance reports, I needed a happy place more than ever.This is when Netflix entered my life; it became my new escape from reality. Instead of isolating myself in darkness to a fantasy land, my eyes widen at the endless expanse of possibilities for my streaming purposes, and for the world, all at finger\\'s touch away. Synonymous with lazy weekends and a minimal brain cell requirement, Netflix is the pinnacle of the new millennium. It\\'s fed by the American adoration for \\'couch potato syndrome.\\' But I don\\'t love Netflix because it\\'s easy. On the contrary, growing up streaming instead of (channel) surfing excavated my inner curiosity.  I can\\'t help but wonder if Pam-and-Jim love will be able to persist in a world increasingly defined by designer babies and swipe-right love connections; It\\'s crippling to realize that consumeristic culture has made our values as fleeting as the character features in a season of Grey\\'s Anatomy; The unexpected consequences of Barry Allen\\'s time travel make me consider the risks of geoengineering; The frustratingly obvious passion in Rachel and Ross\\'s convoluted relationship corroborates David Foster Wallace\\'s point\\\\u2014the most ubiquitous realities are hardest to see.The mishaps of Ted Mosby, the schemes of Neal Caffrey, and the adventures of Kimmy Schmidt move me from my traumas\\\\u2014the way my nose hairs curled in protest as my brother\\'s gasoline-sodden bed lit up upon contact with a measly match, the emptiness I felt when I walked home from school to find Child Protective Services in my driveway\\\\u2014and inspire me to be a relentless inquisitor. Netflix secures that complacently accepting any idea as fact or any proposal as sure-fire is impossible.  My endeavors, leisurely and intellectual, transform into interrogative ones. Whether at a cross-country race examining the effect of mob mentality, or a Model U.N. conference pondering the reach of national sovereignty, I push to understand the nuances of the world\\\\u2014much like I push to watch so many consecutive episodes of Psych that even Netflix doesn\\'t believe I\\'m still there.  Where I find my next query\\\\u2014be it existential, plot-driven, research, or trivial\\\\u2014I don\\'t know. What I do know, however, is that it\\'s soon to come, and it will come driven by the unfettered thinking Netflix cultivated in me. With an internet connection and $8.99/month, I\\'m granted the ability to no longer simply escape reality\\\\u2014a once- necessity now reclassified as a part of my past\\\\u2014but to rebuild it upon infinitudes of hypotheticals.  Essentially, Netflix taught me that the key to understanding the world is to not. Uncertainty is, in fact, a certainty\\\\u2014whether it be simultaneously knowing a particle\\'s exact position and momentum, or finishing off a season with a cliffhanger. I\\'ve adopted my curiosity\\\\u2014led by what some see as idleentertainment, but what I\\'ve come to recognize as an encyclopedia of the world\\\\u2014to come to terms with this.

What prompted you to act? Would you make the same decision again?React or Act Standing in front of my peers at the \\'Back to School\\' assembly, my principal has called me out by name.  I feel myself begin to blush.  I don\\'t consider myself to be a shy kid, but having the whole school staring at me is slightly out of my comfort zone.  I begin to reflect on the events of the past week, guided by a single question, \\'How in the world did I get here?\\' Twitter was abuzz.  The school administration had sent out the \\'Welcome to the Start of the Year!\\' email with some earth-shattering news.  With pitchforks in hand, students took their protest to the 140-character forum, tweeting things such as, \\'How can they do this to us?\\' and \\'That\\'s not fair!\\'  Why was everyone up in arms?  Instead of distributing our lockers by class, the administration planned to assign them randomly, co-mingling the freshmen with seniors, seniors with juniors, and juniors with sophomores, breaking a beloved tradition that had been in place since the school\\'s founding in 1964.  One could only imagine the disaster that would ensue from this decision: Seniors towering over intimidated freshmen, classes no longer growing together, and the rite of passage for juniors to move into senior hall\\\\u2026  DENIED!  But instead of impulsively reacting, I thought about what I could do to take action.  The next morning, armed with my computer and a blank Word document, I prepared for battle.  My fingers flew across the keyboard as I typed every reason why the lockers should be grouped by class.  Honestly, I didn\\'t believe my plea would change anything, but as I finished typing the letter a little voice in my head told me, \\'Send it.\\'  As I clicked save, I realized that just a letter to the administration wasn\\'t enough to speak on the behalf of the entire student body.  Searching for a solution, I converted the letter into a petition and began to send it out to my fellow classmates.  To my surprise, the petition generated a considerable amount of attention.  Kids that I barely knew were messaging me, wondering what they could do to help.  I couldn\\'t believe this was happening.  Before I knew it, I went from being the kid on the debate team to the most sought after individual in school.  Knowing that my peers trusted me to get the job done was both humbling and empowering at the same time.On the first day of school, I navigated my way through the maze of classrooms.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the principal\\\\u2026 and he was walking straight towards me!  By the look on his face, I thought this was the end of Luke Lamey.  To my relief, he commended me for raising awareness in a thoughtful and compelling manner and said that the administration was to hold a meeting to discuss the locker issue.  My simple petition had gone from being hopeless to hopeful, which was an accomplishment in itself.  While no change had occurred, the fact that this issue was being talked about was enough to validate my efforts.So this is how I got here, standing in front of my peers at the \\'Back to School\\' assembly.  Our principal announces that our voices have been heard, and the lockers will be organized by class.  As my peers stand and cheer, I\\'m not sure what I should do.  Do I pump my arms and strike a pose like Usain Bolt?  Do I thrust my fist in the air in victory?  No, that\\'s not who I am.  I just stand and smile back at all the faces cheering for me\\\\u2026 for us\\\\u2014we did it!Now, am I able to solve all of the world\\'s problems?  No, but I wish I could.

I understood the manufacturing process of carbon fiber after I sold a $1,500.00 carbon-fiber briefcase. And of course, I knew the most profitable sizes of dress shoes after selling over twenty pairs of my dad\\'s dress shoes one spring break. I\\'ve become truly in love with my eBay \\'shop\\' and everything that surrounds it for reasons far exceeding the sheer profitability. Through the pursuit of merchandise to stock my eBay \\'shop\\', I have learned mounds about the things in life that are often ignored, and have met numerous unique and wonderful people. From the Moldovan who bought a dingy I repaired, to Bill, an ex-Boeing mechanic who sells Carolina Reaper Peppers at a local swap-meet that my dad andCA Gallard, Alexander CEEB: 480067 Fall 2019 (starts August 8 FYEA CAID: 17645572PREVIEWI visit on the weekends, to Nick Novak, the NFL football kicker I met after I purchased seven left-footed soccer cleats from him on eBay.Because of the unique culture that surrounds eBay and e-commerce, I have been able to find value in the underappreciated, and stories in the neglected parts of life. I have had the privilege of obsessing over suspenders, soccer cleats, and even the oddly populated market of traditional shaving brushes. At the end of the day, this boils down to my realization that every invention has a story. For the past ten years of my life, I have gotten to collect these stories, learn to appreciate them, and then set them loose. I cannot name an item that hasn\\'t taught me something about craftsmanship, ingenuity or design\\\\u2014including lessons on what not to do. I\\'m at the point, however, where I\\'m dying for a story of my own, and pursuing a degree in STEM seems like a surefire way to achieve this goal.Who knows, maybe I\\'ll see my story on eBay one day\"}, {\"index\": 256, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The air reeks of bird dung and sea salt.

The crowd fidgets tirelessly\\\\u2014pushing back hair, digging for sunglasses, peeling away overcoats. \\'Please do not pick up any rocks, plants, or feathers. This is a national park. We try to leave everything the way we find it.\\' My voice over the loudspeaker sounds tinny. I feel like the newest Alcatraz warden, and can only imagine what the inmates think of my rules.Growing up, I sought out experiences for their outcomes, trusting life\\'s rules of reward. A longtime gymnast, I hurled myself backwards on the balance beam because I knew it would make me stronger mentally, physically, and emotionally. In ninth grade, I ate a live scorpion at a street stand in Beijing, deciding that having license to the story was worth the horrid taste. I followed paths that were sure to yield desired results and opted against pursuing those that wouldn\\'t. Relying on the predictable, I failed to realize the world simply isn\\'t.Working on Alcatraz sounded ideal: showing people Al Capone\\'s cell and where he played his banjo at night, trying to decipher various foreign languages, meeting visitors from Milan and Tokyo and Cordoba all in the same day, and exploring the psychology of human confinement. But instead, here I was, prying federally-protected pebbles out of confused children\\'s hands.As I finish my orientation and send visitors up the hill, a few people linger. Most ask a simple question and rush off, but for those who stay, I pick up a conversation. I ask them where they\\'re from, and joke to visitors from Australia that they must\\'ve brought the sunny weather with them. I recommend to a German family that they visit Pier 33\\'s bakery when they dock to try my favorite chocolate muffins. A woman asks me if the DeYoung is worth a visit and before long begins recounting her memory of peering through the window of her father\\'s car at the age of nine. It was then that she observed the urban decay of Baltimore for the first time. The image inspires her work as a volunteer in public schools to this day. I listen as an older man reminisces about his wedding day in 1958, his enthusiasm evident in the jiggle of loose skin below his chin. He insists my wedding day will be the most important day of my life. A twenty-something man dressed as if for a business meeting takes out his Apple earpiece to tell me that he once worked in retail, but decided to return to school to get a degree in library science; it changed his life for the better.My job isn\\'t what I\\'d imagined. But somehow, the script led me to the accidental, to hundreds of new people, and to the understanding that the most memorable outcomes are those unexpected. Whether it\\'s sending an unprompted email to a neuroscience professor, or daring to sing \\'El Mismo Sol\\' at karaoke night in Canc\\\\u00fan, I\\'ve come to do rather than not do, to savor each moment\\'s opportunity without knowing where it might lead. An unexpected friendship, a research opportunity. Small talk might just lead to real talk. I can never predict which first step will lead to another, nor which conversation, which hour, will matter in the end. The treasures never come labeled that way.Out on the bay, I see another ferry approaching.

After having just come back from an embarrassing incident at Sam\\'s Club where my older sister had flung off her pants stating she had her period, I had run to my room with my hands brushing away tears of anger and shame. I didn\\'t realize that the reason she had acted unusual was because of an extra chromosome, having assumed she chose to have Down Syndrome. It was at this moment that I began to view my sister as more of a burden than a friend.Her mistakes and my growing maturity made me hyper aware of my surroundings. At a young age I was raised by my parents to care for her despite her being the older sibling. I was jealous of my friends\\' sisters who taught them about makeup and boys while I learned that Clorox was the best to mop up vomit off the floor and that baking soda gets rid of period stains. Although my parents repeatedly told me I shouldn\\'t act cold towards my sister, I still shunned her because to me she was still a freak I ignored whenever friends came over. I was Hester Prynne and she was the Scarlet Letter, a glaring reminder that my life was more difficult and different than others, at a time when all I wanted to do was fit in. Then one day my friend and I decided to volunteer at our middle school\\'s special education center. Seeing the colorful drawings on the wall and a cartoon playing on the projector, I had an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia. It reminded me of preschool with kids having fun and instructors patiently teaching. An instructor asked me to read the Clifford the Big Red Dog picture book to a girl who also had Down Syndrome. She had an even more severe case than Connie, but she understood what I was saying, smiling and pointing to Clifford. Her joy made me realize her humanity. I saw the middle schoolers and my sister in a new light, realizing I was defining them by their disability rather than other qualities that make them unique. I finally understood that my sister didn\\'t choose to have Down Syndrome and that she had her own dreams. Whenever my parents raised their voices, it was usually directed at her not being able to do something. It was a constant battle because she couldn\\'t realize her own limitations. Yearning to be like the other girls she attempted makeup with stolen lipstick from our mother\\'s bedroom, talked about boyfriends, albeit unreal, and tried to make as many friends as she could. Thinking back on her actions, I realized that we were more alike than I thought; She wanted to fit in, just like me. My parents still expect me to care for Connie, but now I accept their expectations willingly instead of feeling burdened and angry. By opening up to my sister, I\\'ve grown to be a more inclusive person, learning to accept others and their struggles. This pushed me to become involved in high school through Dance Marathon where I learned about global and community based issues, which then led to my participation in Allowance for Good\\'s Global Philanthropy Summit in which I learned about nonprofits and how to practice philanthropy. Through speaking words for other people\\'s benefit rather than putting them down, I have strived to become a voice for people in difficult situations, to spread awareness against social injustice. After getting even more involved through hospital volunteering and my high school\\'s Health Occupational Students of America chapter as Vice President, I\\'m now considering a medical career to help others in a different way other than than social activism. My enthusiasm for helping people stemmed from my sister, and I hope to continue to make a difference in the future.\"}, {\"index\": 258, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The Importance of Being Idle I oftenfind salvation on the top deck of a public bus.The Buddha is commonly believed to have said:\\'To be idle is a short road to death \"}, {\"index\": 259, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I walked up to the house, my lesson plan securely tucked under my arm. When Mark opened the door, his jaw dropped. \\'What is that?\\' he asked incredulously. In response, I brandished a two-foot-tall model of iodine heptafluoride constructed out of pencils and masking tape. I grinned. \\'Are you ready to learn?\\'Although Mark appears to be just like any other kid I tutor, he actually has ADHD, making it hard for him to sit still and focus. I have developed a charismatic teaching style, building tangible objects and performing skits to pique his curiosity, but it was not always easy. The first time I tutored him, I was rummaging through my backpack to grab a worksheet, but when I turned back around, he was gone! I spent the next half-hour in a panicked frenzy. What promised to be a productive tutoring session quickly turned into a house-wide game of hide-and-seek, ending with me having to explain to his mom how I had lost her child. With my pride wounded and my job on the line, I sought to pin down Mark\\'s wandering attention.The next time I went over, I tried a different approach. Making sure I never lost sight of Mark, I gave him a list of words. A game of vocabulary charades ensued. Suddenly, I was a \\'bellicose\\' boxer, weaving in and out of dining room chairs, sparring with an invisible adversary. As I hopped on the table victorious, I could hear Mark giggling with glee. The next hour was a blur. I went through a \\'metamorphosis\\' as a caterpillar, constructing a cocoon out of flowery tablecloth. I ruled over my one-man audience as an affluent member of a powerful \\'oligarchy\\'. I gave an eloquent \\'soliloquy\\' on my passion for fine dining. As my spectacle came to a close, Mark filled the room with applause. I took a bow, my heart racing, my face beaming with pride. I managed to keep Mark in place the entire time.Over the next year, geometry worksheets morphed into spaghetti-noodle pyramids; biology notes into fermentation experiments; Romeo and Juliet into a two-man play. Every week, my creativity flew untethered as I eagerly brainstormed new lessons to teach in my makeshift classroom. My lesson plans served as an anchor against Mark\\'s perpetual hyperactivity, keeping him in place just long enough for his curiosity to kick in. As I watched Mark\\'s grades slowly improve, I was empowered. I learned how to communicate more effectively, how to encourage, how to teach. I threw myself into the learning and had fun at the same time. As I walk back to the car after each lesson, I smile. I am grateful to have a job that lets me give to others while also giving back to me. I used to think success was measured in accolades and quantitative measurements, but my interactions with Mark challenged this mindset, revealing to me the value of the journey; how one achieves goals is just as important as the goal itself. When Mark got his first A, I was proud of him, not only of how far he had come, but also for all the fun we had along the way. I helped enrich Mark\\'s mind with knowledge, and in turn, he has enriched mine with a new perspective on life.\"}, {\"index\": 260, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Rainbow flags hang from the walls of the cafeteria. I speak before a group of high school students about sustainable urban transit. I line up with four hundred thousand people on 8th Avenue to march for environmental action. These are the moments that have defined my life over the past two years. But they were only made possible by the one instant when I defied my own fear and told myself the truth.In that moment, facing the bathroom mirror, I was confronted by confusion and desperation staring back at me. My reflection\\'s tongue struggled to wrap itself around the words in my mind. I felt as though I was peering over the edge of the high dive at the pool and I couldn\\'t see how far away or how deep the water was. I stood trembling, trying to breathe my thoughts into a voice.Finally, I exhaled and the words poured out: \\'I\\'m gay.\\' An indescribable wave of relief swept through me.Soon after, sitting on a bench in a quiet courtyard at school, surrounded by turning October leaves, I said those same two words to my friend Kiley. In that moment, I hated myself. I hated that I felt ashamed. I hated that I had to do this. But Kiley responded with acceptance and love, and all the tension in my body released. For the first time, I felt safe. One by one I came out to my other friends, and one by one their support strengthened me. I no longer felt alone.Armed with my new-found confidence, I wanted to share my voice. In November, I co-founded the LGBT Affinity Club, a support group open to sexual and gender minority students. It was the collective courage of the initial four members which inspired me to come out publicly at a Gay-Straight Alliance meeting. As I stood up to make the announcement, I was momentarily suspended in a fearful, silent vacuum. But with the rush of applause and the reaching hands, I felt a warmth kindle in my chest - just maybe, I thought, I had brightened someone else\\'s life.My experience coming out to my family and friends ignited my interest in activism. Initially, I focused on the issues which affected me most. I led the Affinity Club in working with teachers to make the Middle and Upper School sex education curricula LGBT friendly. As a representative to Community Council, I sponsored a school law which made the dress code gender- neutral. On National Coming Out Day, I arranged for a rainbow flag to fly on the flagpole at school and served on a question and answer panel to educate students and faculty about LGBT issues.As I realized my passion for social and political activism, I found that there were others whose voices were muted. I joined the National Organization for Women chapter at my school and became an advocate for gender equality. At the National Outdoor Leadership School in Wyoming, I became attuned to the beauty and fragility of nature, so I spoke out at the People\\'s Climate March in New York City. For Urinetown , I worked on the design and construction of a set piece which helped the production win an Educational Impact Award. At Model UN, I developed solutions for green urban transit which were featured on the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group website. I am proud of the impact that I am making.A year ago, staring at myself in the bathroom mirror, I could not have foreseen the person I have become. Those two words I whispered to myself have grown into a powerful voice for change. I\\'m proud of that voice. I\\'m proud that I came out to my family and friends.

My sandals, trying their best to shield my feet, ran into all sorts of quagmire on the way as cement, oil, rain, and occasional dog-poop enveloped my bubble of typical upper-middle-class elitism. For those five minutes, my existence became secluded to a mere 100 metre long stretch in the middle of an abandoned industrial settlement, as I prodded against nature\\'s adversity during the consecutive sultry weeks of my internship as the youngest student volunteer from Mumbai at Goonj, an internationally recognised non-profit organisation. Probably it was the contentment that lulled me to sleep each night, knowing that if I was able to battle the torrential downpour today, tomorrow wouldn\\'t be worse. Normally, I would take to my heels the moment it started pouring; but that by-lane offered me something much beyond a muddy deluge- a triumph in endeavour. You know the feeling you get, when you are grappling against a peevish dog on your trail, mist and dust in your eyes, Kendrick Farris\\' appreciation-worth load on your shoulders, an umbrella effortlessly breaking your sweaty palm\\'s tenacious hold, while potholes stymie your gait at every step. But it dawns upon me the very instant, the picture of a hundred beaming underprivileged children, wearing hundred glasses on their noses and a hundred smiles on their faces as they saw the beauty and vivacity of this world. I imagine a dozen girls, wearing a dozen garbs of female honour, as those pads became instruments of breaching the Indian-rural orthodox. I visualise an arsenal of villagers in my country, hand-in-hand, constructing toilets and roofs in their nests, with money that I collect. And for that, I must be prepared to see and bear this fury of nature, at least for five minutes.  \\'The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.\\' - Bertrand Russell, The Triumph of Stupidity  One of the most intriguing ideas of life that make it novel and challenging for me each fleeting minute, is Uncertainty. Hitherto embalmed by over-protective walls of certainty- be it the menu choice at \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Zaffran\\', or preparing to ace my Calculus test, or culling out my traditional kurta-pyjamas during Diwali- at no point in time had I felt the need to teeter between dilemmas, knowing I must choose the road always taken. But when your decisions fail you, and each following step is no less precarious than the former, and the only thing you are ever momentarily certain about is the uncertain lack of ground beneath your feet, a seed of observation and judgement germinates in that dead mud. The dilemma of resisting a spot over stepping on it gave me the smallest form of adventure and self-dependence, spewing life into my mummified spirit of certainty.  In that daily term of five minutes, I often met a friend. He was a passionate poet, a logician who found inspiration for life in the most obvious things: a multi-faceted Rubik\\'s cube, or a coiled spring, or even a boggy lane- something I would never normally view. As I hummed my favourite Bollywood-song, my scientist pondering over prospective electromagnetic de-siltation of the sewer using Einstein-Stokes models, the archaic poet gesticulates to me, prompting to find a reason in this pursuit, a reason for the determination. I am tempted to peep inside me while meteorological vagaries continue; the poet has already begun composing\\\\u2026\\'Concerned we are about rewards for the character, not poetic justice for the society that shapes the character\\'.   The five minutes burgeoned into a year. The reckoning scientist and the beckoning poet joined hands, as I began the Dahisar River Cleaning Project, my new reason to wade in mud. But my contentment and uncertainty persist, knowing that poetic justice is still a long way: I need many more such five minutes.\"}, {\"index\": 263, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Just ten minutes left!\\' I shouted excitedly.After two long weeks going from classroom to classroom publicizing that evening\\'s activity, we were finally ready to put \\'Break the Silence, Stop the Violence\\' in action. There were 11 x 17 inches blue posters with big yellow letters pasted all around the school, which read \\'Dating violence discussion\\', Thursday, August 24, 14:30, A-10 classroom. We posted it on Facebook, and I had talked about the event live on RadioUNAM the week before.Everything was meticulously arranged: Sofia and Paulina would direct the brainstorm; Diana would deliver the handmade souvenirs, and Alex and I would do the debrief. Markers ready, classroom set, 14:30...go!14:40 \\'...They might be coming already; maybe they ended classes later than usual...\\'14:55 \\'...Are you sure you wrote A-10 correctly?...\\'15:15 \\'...Perhaps they forgot the date...\\'It was already 15:50 when we finally faced the reality that nobody would come.What had gone wrong? Was our project not interesting enough? Had we missed something?As these questions arose, I realized the huge responsibility I had, not just for being the team\\'s leader, but for the powerful goal and message \\'Break the Silence, Stop the Violence\\' itself carried. Moreover, I couldn\\'t allow myself to see the frustrated faces of my teammates, not after spending a month living with them in a foreign country and acknowledging how unique, enthusiastic, and bright people they are. Although I too felt disheartened at first, I knew I had to keep my head straight. Thus, taking this failure as an impulse rather than as a hindrance to improve our forthcoming work, I immediately started to design an action plan.First, with special care of fitting my teammates\\' curricular schedules, I created a timetable: Thursdays were for activities, Mondays for team meetings, and Wednesdays for publicity. Next, I brainstormed some activities, focusing mostly on the ones that promoted teamwork and communication, because I realized that, in order to get our school community involved, activities should not be boring and lecture-like as the first one, but rather relevant and engaging. I included some really fun activities like \\'3-legged soccer\\', in which two teams of five couples with jointed legs, play soccer against each other \\\\u2014developing supportiveness and cooperation\\\\u2014. Lastly, I wrote an email to my team telling each one of my peers that even with our unsuccessful first attempt, we should not give up on our project; instead, we should use it as motivation to improve in opportunity areas such as publicity and management. I also requested their collaboration to think of more activities. Thus, we started working with this new plan the next Thursday.It was a hit! Lots of people attended our activity, and took part enthusiastically, congratulating us and continuing the conversation about Dating Violence. After a very exhausting 3-legged soccer match between 10th graders, I discreetly approached Sofia and asked her: \\'What do you think?\\'; and she, with tears rolling down her face, hugged me strongly and said: \\'Thank you for not letting us fall\\'; \\'Well, we all did it together, didn\\'t we?\\', I answered.The first disappointment could have been an impediment, but, instead, I encouraged my team not to give up and pushed myself to generate appropriate solutions. After such an experience, I realized that life is not a summer camp, in which everybody is already eager to engage with your ideas. Out there in the real world you have to be creative, perseverant and resilient, and take nothing for granted. You have to win people\\'s attention, give them reasons to like you and listen to you. After this experience I learned that success is not only about how much effort you put in to achieve your goals, but also about how you are willing to overcome failure.\"}, {\"index\": 264, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Will there be a day when my dad forgets my name? It\\'s a question that haunts me. Three years ago, my dad traveled to Iran for the first time since escaping the 1979 revolution. After he returned, he sat me down to share the story of how he visited his childhood home, elementary school, and most importantly, his father. When they reunited, things were different. They were in a hospital, Grandpa unable to differentiate my dad from the doctors around him.\\'Do you remember who this is?\\' my dad asked, showing an old family photograph. After moments of silence, Grandpa replied, \\'That\\'s Ayoub, my eldest son.\\' He whispered my dad\\'s name like a secret, fearing that someone would hear him and take away the memory. It gave my dad hope that Grandpa still remembered him. But the next question proved devastating. \\'Where is he now?\\' Grandpa asked, unaware that his son sat right beside him. It was then that my dad finally accepted that Grandpa had Alzheimer\\'s Disease. As my dad shared the story, I wondered: would this ever repeat itself between us? That moment set me on a journey to learn about Alzheimer\\'s. I discovered that 44 million people had the disease, which is more than prostate and breast cancer combined. Worst of all, Alzheimer\\'s is hereditary, meaning my dad may suffer the same fate as my grandpa. This realization terrified me. More importantly, it inspired me to take action.But inspiration meant nothing without innovation. As a 17-year-old, the odds were against me to cure an age-old disease. I didn\\'t have the experience of a doctor, knowledge of a professor, or deep pockets of an executive. So I had to think creatively. Ultimately, I found the answer where I spend nearly three hours a day: the race track. As captain of the track and field team, I used my leadership position for a greater purpose and initiated a statewide race called Ready, Set, Glow: The 5K To Cure Alzheimer\\'s Disease. A glow-in-the-dark charity run, Ready Set Glow\\'s mission was to fundraise for Alzheimer\\'s research and shine a light \\\\u2014 both literally and figuratively \\\\u2014 on the disease.The experience catapulted me outside my comfort zone. I cold-called organizations like the Alzheimer\\'s Association to sponsor us. I worked with my district\\'s Athletic Department to partner with four other schools across the state. I mobilized my track teammates to plaster posters around town and run door-to-door to encourage sign-ups. For months, I routinely checked Ready Set Glow\\'s registration page, eager to see the $20 sign-ups come in. Each dollar felt like we were buying minutes of memory for loved ones. Ultimately, we raised $5,246, recruiting 176 runners and a handful of donors.As I plan next year\\'s Ready Set Glow race, I try to remember the greater takeaway here. It\\'s not just about how much we fundraised. Nor is it about how many runners came together in the freezing Chicago weather. The takeaway is that age is no excuse for inaction. Most of us are paralyzed by our dreams. We wait until we\\'re ready to make a difference. We convince ourselves that we\\'re not old enough. Not wise enough. Not tough enough. Or at least that\\'s how I felt before starting Ready Set Glow. Today, my inner voice is stronger. It tells me to seize opportunities. Or better yet, to create them. In college, I\\'m excited to strengthen this inner voice even further and work with other students so we can create a better tomorrow.

Rajvir,\\' my teacher announces.I excitedly jump off my seat, accidentally knocking over my partner\\'s books, and with a murmur of \\'Sorry\\', I approach the teacher\\'s desk. I face the class, and I see students in various stages of dozing off - some with eyes half-closed. I begin talking about the Cuban Missile Crisis, sure that I will wake some people up. Instantly, as if a wave of energy had just struck them, ears perk up, and the class livens. \\'I told you!\\' I tell myself.Encouraged, I go on. I end my presentation with a flourish, awaiting the standing ovation and applause that I know is coming.Laughter.The whole class is in hysterics, and I cannot believe that my classmates find the almost-to-be nuclear armageddon funny. I have to shout over the laughter to ask, \\'Ma\\'am, was it me?\\'\\'You should try speaking slowly Rajvir,\\' my teacher gently chides me. \\'No one understood what you were saying.Not even me.\\' Hot tears of shame prick against my eyelids. I am always perfectly clear at the dinner table, where my dad and I regularly hold heated debates about everything from Mr. Modi\\'s foreign policies to Greece\\'s economic crisis, but in front of the class, the speed of my speech always ratchets up. The exasperated looks on people\\'s faces when I popped up in class to answer a question or discuss an issue had lowered my once always - raised hand. But I still wanted to participate, to argue, and to contribute in tangible ways.******************************************************************************* \\'Write what you want, Rajvir.\\' My father\\'s sharp voice jerks me out of my preoccupation.Taking a deep sigh, I begin to write. And almost as if by magic, the words start to flow. Three pages worth of words. Things I know.\\'Now read them out loud, slowly and clearly. Imagine you\\'re in class. Read.\\' This routine continues day after day, night after night. Slowly, I realize that I don\\'t have to be afraid, that I have unique ideas, and am capable of sharing them.Such was the genesis of CurrentHow, where I started to write down everything I thought about the present fate of the world. The widespread acceptance my work earned, from over 650,000 visitors to coverage in the national media, emboldened me to aim higher. With this newfound confidence from writing, I consciously began to improve my relationship with words and speech. My teachers began to see dramatic improvements. Soon, I began to be regularly selected to represent my school at debates, MUNs, and roundtable conferences around the country. I feel more accepted now that I can approach any group after an event and have a good, hearty discussion on the topics I love.I may still slip into a rapid-fire bark now and then, but I have learned to respect every word - written or spoken. I have realized that the moment you start giving each word its due share of time and respect, that\\'s when you get noticed by others and begin to contribute to the beautiful diversity of human thought.\"}, {\"index\": 266, \"new_personal_statement\": \"My hand began to twitch as it brought itself closer to my lips. I knew this wasn\\'t right, yet I couldn\\'t resist. I mustered all the willpower embedded into every cell of my anatomy in an attempt to distance my fingertips from my mouth, but to no avail. It was inevitable. After days of self-restraint, I would relapse yet again. I abstained for so long, but no amount of strength in this universe was able to hold me back from this temptation. The constant finger-tapping and the endless gum-chewing were all for nothing as I surrendered to my cravings and chipped away at my nails once again.The act of nail-biting may seem unorthodox to some, but to me, the sensation it provoked was remarkably satisfying. The relief that it triggered would provide me with an immense joy, yet no amount of joy could quite mask the guilt that would come to parade my conscience afterwards. I was more than eager to ruin my hard-work and discipline in order to experience a measly thirty seconds of pleasure as I chomped on my fingernails;\\'Why are humans so irrational?\\' I thought to myself, feeling ashamed of my nonsensical whims and desires. I allowed the problem to fester, ultimately reaching a point whereby it became subconscious \\\\u2013 I would sit at my desk, pondering the countless reasons as to why this was a terrible habit, ironically whilst biting my nails. By that point, it had become second nature, an act that was incorporated into each and every aspect of my daily life.Regardless, I was not prepared to admit defeat. I knew that I was stronger than this.\\\\\\\\\\\\u2018I shall not allow one minor setback to stop me from overcoming this unhealthy habit\\',I reiterated as I reflected on what had just occurred. A different approach was needed to ensure that this mishap would cease to repeat itself, and so I began to search online for an answer. I read somewhere that 50% of adolescents regularly bite their nails, a discovery which furthered my drive to end my addiction as I refused to become another statistic.After hours of flipping through dermatology books in the hopes of finding a remedy to rid me of this god-forsaken habit, I stumbled upon a seemingly plausible - yet peculiar - solution: applying bitter tasting nail polish to my fingernails.I found this cure to be rather unusual, a strange excursion of which I would be the pioneer. I toyed with the idea at first, fearful of the slight chance that it would fail andin turn takeme right back to square one. Nevertheless, after swallowing my doubts, I embarked on my journey.As each day passed, it proved easier and easier to refrain. Were there times I would slip up? Of course! However, I realized that setbacks are an integral part of success. Initially, I would ignore the bitter taste and continue to chew and bite, but after a bit of adjustment - and much ingested nail polish - I realized that the meager reward was not worth the suffering. Eventually, nail-biting was demoted from its status as second nature, and cast out into the abyss of forgotten habits. Thanks to a combination of creativity, determination, and perseverance, I was able to surmount the initial hurdles and continue on the path of triumph. Here I am, two years later, with not the slightest clue as to what fingernails even taste like.\"}, {\"index\": 267, \"new_personal_statement\": \"At first glance, the mix of music on my phone seems like some sort of mistake. Songs in four languages and at least five distinct musical styles are scattered throughout. To me, however, the amalgamation makes perfect sense once I hit play. At the top of my playlist, songs titled \\'Papaoutai\\' or \\'Merci\\' appear. French artists came into my life when I began taking French in middle school. My teachers often would have us sing along to popular French songs, songs that I would immediately go home and listen to over and over again. I loved the way the language felt. While most people would agree French sounds smooth and romantic when spoken, I found that French artists like Stromae used the percussive back of the throat and hard vowels to make the words themselves sound like a new kind of instrument.The phone shuffles and lands on a new genre: Spanish. Songs in Spanish manifested on my playlist after attending many family reunions with my Mexican relatives. I adore the irresistible pulse of life that urges the listeners to get up and dance in a way that cannot be found in most American songs. I remember blasting the magnificent song \\'Suavemente\\' by Elvis Crespo though my earbuds while I suffered through Disneyland\\'s Haunted Mansion last year. Since I\\'m not a huge fan of horror rides, using cheerful music to block out the sounds of ghouls was the only way I would submit to going on the attraction.The end of a song signals the start of another, this time in Portuguese. Portuguese crept onto my phone through my Brazilian aunt\\'s influence. I have spent countless hours playing with my cousin and sisters at her house while soft Bossa Nova melodies float about the rooms. Portuguese singers caress their words, allowing them to tumble out in such an effortless way that the song is as gentle as a lullaby. Listening to the careless sounding cadences is the perfect way to relax after a strenuous day.The playlist then shifts to musical theater albums where I shamelessly know every single word, sometimes to the alarm of whoever pulls up next to me at a stoplight. I\\'ve also found that there is simply no better way to draw someone out of a bout of melancholy than by using my considerable range of strange facial expressions to dramatically lip sync with \\'There Right There\\' from Legally Blonde. Since I adore storytelling, musicals are endlessly engaging to listen to, especially when I don\\'t know the story behind the songs and get to invent one of my own.Finally, my playlist shuffles to classical music. This music has served as the soundtrack to the majority of my studying throughout high school. It\\'s also the medium of music I devote myself to at Orange County School of the Arts. Classical music, when done correctly, can diffuse any stress I have; it can make me smile in appreciation or break down crying because it feels as if the music understands something fundamental inside of me. It\\'s nearly omnipresent in my life, a fact of which I am deeply grateful. From Stromae to Legally Blonde, my great musical loves are all patches in the technicolor quilt of me.\"}, {\"index\": 268, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I take cold showers. Several years back, the water heater in my house broke, and for weeks, bathing in freezing water was my reality. Although it took some getting used to, I discovered that there\\'s something refreshing about being drenched in icy droplets. And so, even after the water heater was repaired, I kept the habit. To this day, each time I step in the shower, I first turn the knob to the cold side. More than just being refreshing and energizing, though, the cold shower has changed the way I approach life.The worst part about showering in cold water is the moment right before taking the plunge. As soon as you hop in, however, your body quickly adjusts to the temperature, and it\\'s not so bad the rest of the way. For me, stepping into the cold water means resolve; it\\'s getting over the hesitation that comes from knowing I\\'m about to do something uncomfortable. One of my first \\'cold shower\\' moments came on my first day working at my local aquatics center. In the middle of my shift, I heard shouting outside on the pool deck. Walking onto the pool deck, I saw that parents were yelling at one of our swim instructors. With three adults yelling at each other, I wasn\\'t sure if I was supposed to intervene and try to help. After all, I was a 15-year-old working his first day at his first job. But with our manager out for the weekend, I was the only other employee on site. I knew this could also be a chance for me to prove myself as a new employee. So, taking a deep breath, I walked up to the parents to ask how I could help.In an eardrum-shattering rage, they explained that their son\\'s swim lesson registration hadn\\'t gone through in the computer system. So, a bit flustered, I apologized for the problem and offered to give their son a free swim lesson to compensate for her troubles. Surprisingly, they accepted and immediately calmed down, apologizing for raising their voices. I was struck by how a simple act of stepping forward and being understanding changed the entire dynamic of that confrontation.Another cold shower moment came a few months later at school, when I asked for an internship after a career day presentation. One of the speakers was a manager at a large Silicon Valley venture capital firm. The more she talked about her job, the more I became intrigued. Since I had an interest in economics as well as technology, working at a venture capital firm seemed like the perfect place for me. So I decided that I was going to ask the speaker if her company hired interns.As I approached her, however, I was a bit apprehensive. After all, why would a successful business woman offer a job to an inexperienced high schooler? Still, gathering up my courage, I took the plunge, walked up to her, and introduced myself. We ended up having a fascinating conversation, and, to my surprise, she agreed to interview me for an internship. That summer, I ended up having the opportunity to work for her firm.I\\'ve come to realize that good things happen to those who are willing to be uncomfortable and step into uncertainty. In college and life, I know that I will encounter many opportunities as well as challenges. But when I am, I\\'ll know that success comes from embracing whatever hesitance comes and taking action anyway. Cold showers have taught me to face the uncomfortable with poise and confidence.Some days, the Burlingame Aquatics Center (BAC) is run entirely by teenagers. Working there as a swim instructor and coordinator, I was oftentimes put in charge of the whole facility. My role revolved primarily around responding to customers and ensuring that swim lessons went smoothly. Of course, with any customer service job comes working with difficult customers. During one of my first days in the position, I faced a challenging situation when a parent of one of our swim lesson students began yelling at the front desk receptionist. Noticing something was wrong, I ran up to the front and asked the parent what was wrong. In an eardrum-shattering rage, she explained that she\\'d registered her son for a month of swim lessons, but the registration hadn\\'t gone through in our facility\\'s computer program. I was unsure of what to do; with my manager gone for the weekend, it was clear that I would have to take responsibility. So, a bit flustered, I apologized for the problem and offered to give her son a free swim lesson to compensate for her troubles. Surprisingly, her demeanor changed instantly. Accepting the offer, she immediately apologized for raising her voice. I was struck by how much a simple act of understanding was able to change the entire dynamic of that confrontation.  During my time at BAC, I also learned the value of proactiveness. I noticed that many of our swim students were also water polo players and were taking swimming lessons to improve their game. With this, I decided to start a water polo lesson program, offering private lessons to students who wanted to build their polo skills. At first, I taught these lessons myself, but as more and more students began signing up for these lessons, more instructors began to teach these lessons as well, and the program continues to grow.  Through this work experience, I\\'ve come to understand that leadership stems from the ability to respond to the needs of others through understanding and an ability to respond effectively, as well as the proactivity to create solutions that benefit all involved. As an annual school tradition, the entire sophomore class at my high school puts writer William Golding, famous author of The Lord of the Flies, on trial. In the case, Golding has been accused of committing libel against the human race in his allegorical assertion that violence and evil is an innate part of human nature. The whole class is split into two groups: one prosecuting and one defending Golding. Four attorneys are selected for each side, with the rest of the class representing \\'witnesses\\', or historical figures whose stories can help defend or contradict Golding. As one of the four selected prosecution attorneys, I had the unique opportunity to help lead the trial process.  My involvement as an attorney meant I was in part responsible for organizing the witnesses; helping to craft witness statements and evidence to support our case. Over the course of months, we spent many hours meeting with our witnesses to research their roles, discussing how to best present their arguments. I worked with each of my individual witnesses, collaborating with the other attorneys to refine the evidence and statements to deliver the strongest case possible.  On the prosecution side, our stance was that humans are not innately violent. Our main argument was that violence in humans comes from external influences. As we worked to build our case, I realized we were drawing upon the ideas of philosophers like Locke and Rousseau, who argued that humans are born with a \\'blank slate\\' and are inherently virtuous. I was fascinated by the many philosophical schools of thought on human nature, Through my participation in this project, I grew both as a student and as a person. As an attorney, I had to take evidence from various sources and extract the points that best supported our argument.  I learned to be analytical and to think deeply into these philosophical questions without clear answers.  Working with dozens of my classmates to build a case and organize our arguments taught me to think critically in a collaborative environment. These are skills I will use in college and in life. \"}, {\"index\": 269, \"new_personal_statement\": \"As the headmaster of the Umang School for Disabled Children rang the bell to signify the start of the day, my class of 20 students were already hard at work on their multiplication tables. This was no ordinary class of students; the children whom had already asked too many questions to count in the congested classroom were all suffering from some form of neurological disease.In August 2013, when my family and I were taking a trip to Jaipur, India to visit my grandparents, I had my first encounter with the issue I hope to address throughout my life. Inspired by the stories I had heard growing up of neighbours never too busy to chip in or lend a hand, I decided to give back to a community which had continually given my family so much by volunteering at a local school: the Umang School for Disabled Children. Having lived most of my life in the perpetually frozen city of Calgary, Alberta, the oppressive 35 degree Celsius heat of the August sun coupled with the lack of an air conditioner in the school created a grueling environment in which I was to spend over 200 hours that summer. However, teaching math and science to children suffering from mental disorders like autism, and seeing the dedication with which they pursued their education in spite of their circumstances, drove me to come back every single day. Though I left a month later, the knowledge of the effects these diseases can have on hardworking, kind and innocent kids stuck with me. It was for this reason that the problem of mental disorder and disease became a central aspect of my life, and therefore an issue that I have already attempted to tackle and will continue to as a clinical neurologist.Whether it was assisting a neurologist with his rounds at the Peter Lougheed Hospital, launching an inquiry into access to mental health resources as a chair on Calgary\\'s Mayor\\'s Youth Council, or founding an award-winning non-profit which has raised tens of thousands for mental health research, I continued to find ways to positively impact the pervasive problem my trip to Jaipur brought into focus. Most of all, I wanted to tackle the problem of neurological disorders through scientific research and so jumped at the opportunity to do so in 2015. Fueled by the desire to create something which would be truly impactful, I started collaborating with Dr. Steven Greenway and Dr. Gerald Pfeffer at the Hotchkiss Brain Institute in the University of Calgary on a medical genetics project. My efforts took the form of developing a less invasive, more sensitive, and cheaper technique to diagnose Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor in patients. Through this project, I encountered a world of amazing complexity and unfathomable applications, and was instantly hooked.Though initially I had no idea how to perform a PCR or extract DNA from cerebrospinal fluid, I spent hundreds of hours in the lab and even more time in front of the computer, reading publication after publication, learning about the intricacy and revolutionary power of medical genetics. As a result of this, and the guidance of those I worked with, the protocol I developed had a diagnostic rate higher than those obtained through conventional techniques while not requiring any surgery. Currently, this research is published in Canadian Journal of Neurological Science and has been the recipient of hundreds of thousands of dollars in grant funds and multiple regional and national awards.When I traveled with my family to India in 2013, I did it with every intention of giving back to my community. In retrospect however, that experience gave me more than I could ever give back, as it was the beginning of a life- long passion. Teaching a class of 20 kids how to add two digit numbers invariably lead to my commitment to impact the issue of mental health as a clinical neurologist.\"}, {\"index\": 270, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The human mind is a beautifully complex thing in which there lies a minimal distinction between pure genius and absolute insanity.

Sometimes we get lost in our schoolwork, in our jobs, in our duties, and we never take time to discover our interests and hobbies. We must discover ourselves in order to live a life of fulfillment and success. Just like artists paint their own portraits, I am painting my own portrait by discovering who I am. I had no idea what my painting was going to look like during my freshman year. I joined several clubs including the honor band, the STEM club, Operation Smile, student government and other extracurricular activities to find out what I liked. I still did not have an established group of friends and I was lost in the world of high school academia.I had started the sketch of my portrait, no clear image yet. I was still in the process of choosing the colors and the size of the canvas. All my life, my portrait had been painted by those around me. I was now ready to grab the paintbrush for myself and take control.In sophomore year, my interests were a bit clearer. I decided to leave the band and focus on my other interests. I had many questions about life in general, which made me realize I have a curious personality. When my grandfather passed away, I started to question God\\'s will. Why had he chosen that destiny for my grandfather?Has God already chosen the paths we will take in our lives? My portrait was still in the making. I did learn something important in sophomore year: it is okay to change my portrait, to change my interests and to try new things. During junior year, I chose to diversify my skills by taking IB Visual Arts and got even more involved in Operation Smile and the STEM club. I got to know myself from a different perspective when I traveled to different countries on my own. Meeting people from different backgrounds made me realize that being different is a quality to embrace. I am a very analytical person who constantly reflects on how my values, background and culture affect my actions. This constant reflection helped me strengthen my friendships. All these experiences led me to rethink my portrait several times. My portrait was starting to take shape and certain colors were now visible. In senior year, I have a clearer idea of who I am: a determined, friendly, adventurous individual who likes art, mathematics and reading. I am a person who likes to travel and embark on new journeys. Looking back to the start of freshman year, my portrait now has structure, composition and is reflective of my identity. I realized that my family, friends and teachers are the frame that holds the canvas of my portrait. All of the lessons and experiences they have provided me with are what surround my portrait, giving it support and a solid structure. I can now see a painting that is taking form.However, I came to the realization that my portrait will never be finished. It is an ever changing portrait which started from the day I was born and will end until the day I die. The beauty of life is that you are always discovering who you are. I believe that receiving a good well-rounded education will help me further discover myself. Those skills I will learn in university will allow be to succeed in the real world and try to impact the lives of those around me. My portrait still needs work, but at the end it is the journey that counts, not the destination.\"}, {\"index\": 272, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 273, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Most children are influenced by their hometown, aligning with the belief that a person is a product of their environment and molded by their surroundings. I, however, have been shaped by not only the culmination of my cultural experiences, but also the constant lack of stability from a nomadic childhood. From an early age, I developed an independence from finding comfort in stagnancy that has served me well throughout my academic and athletic careers. I have no issue with steadiness, but rather I am all too excited by the constituents of change to care for repetition.\\'Where are we going next?\\' I asked my mother every four years.I was never satisfied by successfully integrating into another culture, instead, I was fascinated by the increase in ease that was coupled with the stark differences of every transition. Believe me, it wasn\\'t the countless stripped friendships or the furthering distance from family that cultivated my intrinsic desire for change. It was the excitement of inconsistency, that no surrounding difference would ever be the same as the last. I craved from a young age such excitement, it being the only constant that I could hold onto.My playground was a map of potential cultures to learn from, destinations that stimulated my curiosity, and new languages that made the puzzle more interesting. What resulted was a teenager in upstate New York who couldn\\'t handle redundancy, where the detection of a pattern would lead to disinterest and apathy. What marked the end of my interest in soccer sparked an obsession with snowboarding, something I have yet to find redundant.No matter the countless attempts to repeat a specific action, each execution is distinct from the last; every carve through the snow, flip through the air, or slide on a rail is autonomous from previous attempts. I was captivated by how my practice would yield such nominal progress, resulting in my desire to conquer its opposition to improvement. It was no longer suitable for me to approach each maneuver in an algorithmic fashion, I had to take each situation for its own independent event. I could no longer turn to my cookie-cutter problem solving skills, I had to adapt to each and every execution differently.\\'How will the temperature affect my turn?\\'\\'Do I have enough speed?\\'\\'Will my edge grip the takeoff?\\'I was inebriated by factors out of my control to the point that I couldn\\'t get enough of the inherent uncertainty of snowboarding. I was enthralled by the constant component of change. The same component I find so fascinating in medicine.I recall my very first opportunity to observe surgery in the OR. I pestered the physician with countless hypotheticals that were only met with the same, \\'I don\\'t know\\' and \\'it depends.\\' The once concrete concepts I had learned about in biology and anatomy were now merely guidelines for the surgeon as he continued to operate on the spinal cord, delving into a world of endless possibilities and outcomes. There were so many components to the procedure that not one of his actions was done subconsciously. What intrigued me the most however, was his acknowledgment of the unknown and the constant thirst to overcome it even though he would never want it to end.My innate desire to pursue a life that is full of the unexplored stems from the unique combination of influences that have since exhilarated my passion to seek out further opportunities of uncertainty. I am excited to have found my next pursuit that forces me to live a lifestyle of perpetual learning. By choosing to live a life free of repetition, doctors combine their quest for knowledge with a way to serve, save lives, and lead into the unknown. I strive to do the same. It is integral to my sense of happiness, and what I hope will lead to my sense of purpose in this world.\"}, {\"index\": 274, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Watch out in Chinatown\\\\u2026.\\' Warned my dad, letting his sincere worry and his black and white perspectives weigh on the stress of each syllable.

The robberies really changed him\\\\u2014go easy on him.\\' I nodded in deference to his experience and out of respect for my parents\\' struggle, yet as I crossed the Golden Gate Bridge that led from our comfortable suburb into the colorful neighborhoods of San Francisco, I felt invigorated by vibrant chaos.I park in the thick of an urban environment, senses assailed by rapid-fire bargaining and shrill, thousand-year-old street instruments. I turn into an alleyway and happen upon a small shop-front jutting into the street; the vendor sits in quiet but vigilant sentry, prone perhaps to the same shopkeeper prejudices as my father.\\'Hi! Excuse me, Ma\\'am. May I take your portrait?\\' I begin hesitantly but with typical enthusiasm. She looks around cautiously, patting her wallet in uncertain strokes as she assesses her level of safety via my propensity for mischief, here in her Chinatown alleyway: Tourist? Scammer? New variety of young miscreant? I can see her thoughts. \\'Student!\\' I offer earnestly. If she agreed, it would be my third successful street interview of the day.  \\'Sorry, but what is this for?\\' She asks in Mandarin. Delighted by the switch to my mother tongue as perhaps my \\'in\\', I explain the premise of my project. Inspired by Brandon Stanton and the Humans of Ithaca initiative I started for the newspaper club at Cornell Summer College, I took a risk, a departure from what I knew. I designed a project utilizing the medium of street photography and interviews to capture the living creature that is Chinatown.Elusive, intriguing, and often misunderstood, Chinatown would be presented on her own terms by her own people, through my open eyes and ears.  On any other day, I, like anyone else walking through Chinatown, may have passed the world-weary shopkeeper, but today, I began an exchange, \\'May I take your portrait?\\' After my explanation, she seemed satisfied and began a narrative that struck me as crucial to our history as Asians, as Americans, as human beings. As the photographs and interviews began to accumulate, I realized just how significant my project, the people, had become to me.These tiny pockets of life brimmed with collective experience, and I\\'ve discovered how connected we all are, how far a smile goes, and how actively engaging is akin to respecting and understanding.Each day, I start with a simple question.I approach street cleaners, shopkeepers, musicians, and tattooed alleyway dwellers. I strive to discover the commonalities that bind our collective experiences, and to comprehend the divisive differences that further misunderstanding and fear.  I am extending my haunt to include other flourishing neighborhoods including the cherry-blossomed Japantown, tie-dyed Haight, and jazzy Fillmore. I am rejected just as much as I am permitted, which has taught me the art of acceptance and the importance of true communication on equal footing. Today, however, was a good day \\\\u2013 three portraits, three stories, three new perspectives. As my understanding broadens, I see San Francisco winking at me through its idiosyncratic denizens, each a microcosm of the world. I offer these stories, which inspired my film Tang, as a conversation starter, a multicolor lens to layer over sepia, over black and white. As I raise my camera to immortalize another human experience in still frame, I can\\'t help but grin. \\'Xie xie.\\' I say; \\'thank you.\\' Through this experience, we are each a face saved from anonymity\\\\u2014street photographer, subject, and audience alike.\"}, {\"index\": 275, \"new_personal_statement\": \"When I began high school in the heart of downtown Portland, my daily commutes revealed something I had never noticed before. Nestled in the shadows of Chinatown was a thriving homeless camp, sharply juxtaposed with the abandoned buildings right next door. Although the camp was surrounded by a rainbow of vibrant signs, I saw adults huddled underneath what looked like oversized tables protected only by tarps. What I found most shocking was that despite living along Portland\\'s busiest road in broad daylight, they were still invisible to the world around them. My shock quickly turned into a desire to get to know the individuals and their stories hidden behind the signs. So, after asking how to help, I began volunteering at a local family shelter. Expecting to see somber faces, I was met with unexpected laughter and warmth.I learned that contrary to what I see on my daily commutes, the average age of a person experiencing homelessness in the US is just nine years old. Only a year younger than me, Norena was the oldest of the kids in shelter. She was the big sister, introducing me to the younger kids like they were family. Whether it was taking the time to read to Lucas or spending the entire day with Kayla to create a puppet show out of paper sacks and googly eyes, Norena always put the kids above herself.As we bonded over our shared love for lacrosse and Stephen King, I often found myself forgetting that she was homeless. However, listening to Norena speak about the obstacles she faced on a daily basis brought me back to reality. When her family became homeless after losing their food cart, she could no longer afford to play the sport we both loved. The stress she faced as a result also caused her confidence and grades to drop. I realized that the effects of homelessness extend beyond the struggle for housing and security, yet there wasn\\'t enough attention or resources given to homeless youth. Inspired by Norena\\'s determination to empower others in the face of her own adversities, I became driven to address the lack of resources in shelters and bring awareness to the unheard stories of youth homelessness.After listening and gathering further stories from kids, I created a nonprofit called Kids First Project during my sophomore year that addresses their biggest challenge: the lack of educational and recreational programs. As I pondered how to bring programs directly to the kids in shelter, I realized that my classmates had power within their different interests and passions but no outlet to channel them into service-learning. By creating a platform for over 300 volunteers to lead free lacrosse workshops, poetry classes, mentoring and tutoring sessions, as well as other weekly programs in the eight shelters we serve, Kids First brings support to the kids in shelter and attention to the issue of youth homelessness, bridging the invisible divide. I will never forget the week Norena got back into housing and returned as a volunteer, an incredible moment where I knew that she had shown the younger kids that \\'homeless\\' would never define them. She told me that beyond growing her passions through Kids First, she also found the confidence within herself to know that she can also empower others. Through the development of Kids First, listening to stories like Norena\\'s evolved from a method of understanding the complexities of homelessness into the basis of my passion for driving innovative and meaningful change. And today, I continue to live by the lessons Norena taught me: to embrace the people around you, discover a reason to smile in every situation, and find purpose in compassion. As I go on to explore my interests within new groups and communities, I will continue to seek and amplify the stories of those around me, never allowing a person or a need to remain invisible.Last May I decided to take on leading Oregon\\'s Global Youth Service Day, a feat that I knew was no simple task. At the time, I had been fixated on the idea of intersectionality within human rights, a realization that nothing is truly independent and every issue instead overlaps in constant flux. Aware that there were other youth-led initiatives addressing different needs outside of my nonprofit, Kids First Project, I wanted to host an Intersectionality Workshop as a way for all of us to support each other - the first ever event in my community where all the youth-led nonprofits would connect and collaborate for a common purpose.I gathered my Kids First Project team and Hope For Homeless Club members to reach out to as many youth-led nonprofits that we knew of. We ended up recruiting a total of five organizations that addressed issues ranging from gender inequality to human trafficking. Sharing the vision of intersectionality, we began meeting every week to plan the workshop and discuss the issues we worked on to find how all the issues were interrelated. Poverty and homelessness created a barrier between children and their ability to receive an education. Without schooling and resources, children - especially girls - are vulnerable to becoming victims of human trafficking. The day of the workshop, we each had our own booths followed by a related service-learning activity. After rotating through every workshop, we held a group panel discussion. Together, we found similarities among all the issues that had not been discussed before. The discussion led to the realization that a solution could in fact simultaneously address different issues if we looked toward the roots rather than the surface. It was incredible to see a simple vision come to life, where my excitement for intersectionality was not only shared in that one day, but also extended beyond the workshop. Today, it\\'s not uncommon to see the youth-led nonprofits in Portland working together on initiatives and advocacy projects, highlighting the power of collective impact in creating change.Slow down. Predict. Strategize. Trust your gut. These are the steps you have to take in order to win a game of chess. Growing up, my Saturday nights consisted of an eight by eight chess board, managing to captivate me for hours on end. Through eight hour tournaments and even longer days spent honing in my skills and analyzing different plays, I developed an ability to predict up to ten moves ahead during a game.Even though I only thought of the process I created as a way to outsmart my opponent at the time, I began to realize later on how each strategy framed my approach to life. Like the pawns on a chessboard, I learned that hurtling head first into a situation is not always the best strategy. Taking everything one step at a time, I fully deliberate different paths to navigate, whether it\\'s working on a project for school or cradling the ball during a lacrosse game. Like in predicting my opponent\\'s decisions and why they made a certain move, I continue to cherish my connections with others, determined to understand another person\\'s beliefs and perspectives to develop my own perspective. Like creating my own mental plan on a chessboard, I continue to thrive when I think and strategize, discovering the best innovative approaches to address the unaddressed needs of homelessness and poverty within my community. Like having to create risky moves in a game of chess, I\\'ve learned to trust my gut, placing confidence in myself to know that I am capable of achieving what I put my mind to, accepting that failure is inevitable but should be viewed as a positive challenge for growth.The strategies and approaches chess has instilled in me have become skills that I apply in every endeavor I pursue. As I continue to face opportunities and challenges within and outside of the classroom, I always remember to slow down, predict, strategize, and trust my gut.\"}, {\"index\": 276, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 277, \"new_personal_statement\": \" My lunch encompasses many colors. Hot Cheetos, cherry Jello, strawberry Gushers (all thanks to red #40).Orange Goldfish crackers, baby carrots, and a tangerine. Yellow, dairy-like cheese sticks and vanilla pudding. A sour Granny Smith apple with peanut butter, and juicy purple grapes from the backyard.  My mom helped me pack my first lunch as a kindergartnerbut expected me to follow the family tradition of packing my own lunch after that. I think my parents followed this advice from the Ann Landers\\' columns: \\'It is not what you do for your children, but what you have taught them to do for themselves that will make them successful human beings.\\' Cleaning bathrooms, moving lumber, mowing the lawn, cooking a meal \\\\u2014 we were taught with precision and clarity \\'how to,\\' then it was up to us to do it independently. Lunches represented more than the joy of savory and sweet bites in my family; they represented a tradition of self-sufficiency that was valued in each stage of formation and education.  Yet one day in eighth grade I found myself with a different type of lunch. This lunch had been prepared by someone else\\\\u2014with love and generosity that I greatly appreciated\\\\u2014but it was not my own. I reached into the bag and began foraging for food: an apple, celery sticks, one-half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and, to top it off, a note that read, \\'Our prayers are with you and your family.\\' I sat down on a school bench and couldn\\'t help but break down.  My father was killed in a car accident in August of my eighth-grade year. A few hours after that pivotal and tragic collision, my older sister reminded me of the last time we were all together. We were at one of my swim meets, and my family was there to cheer me on, but they were also there simply to be together. She said, \\'We\\'re going to have to be like that more than ever now.\\' After we lost my dad, my friends and community instantly stepped in, packing me lunches that I didn\\'t want and asking me what my favorite foods were. But I didn\\'t want their food. I wanted to wake up and pack my own lunch, alongside the one person, my dad, who knew what it felt like to eat absurdly-colored, unhealthy snacks and still be skinny.   With my dad gone and my older siblings married, it was just my mom, my younger brother, and me at home. I became the guardian of our home, the one who entered the house first and put gas in the car at night. It was hard to go from the protected to the protector in just a day.Through it all, one thing gave me great comfort: my bag filled with Hot Cheetos, yogurt, fruit snacks, and cookies. Each bite fed a new and unbridled curiosity for how the world works. Whether I was researching treatments for chronic immune deficiencies by isolating proteins in human colostrum, striking up conversations with FFA members throughout the state and nation, or advocating for the continued protection of California\\'s natural resources, I found that my curiosity was fueled not by the food I ate, but by the strength and self-sufficiency that I learned on that first day of kindergarten.   Because I stand at a slender 6\\' 4\\' with thick brown hair, I am often told that I bear a striking resemblance to my dad. Beyond my physical appearance, I hope to carry on his legacy through my zeal for learning, fearlessness in the face of failure, and above all, appreciation for good food and hard work. I look forward to diving into my next challenge and opportunity, college. I am going to pack my own lunch, complete with the sweet and savory memories of a vibrant family life, strength in triumphantly overcoming obstacles, and an unrivaled self-sufficiency.\"}, {\"index\": 278, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I don\\'t know what\\'s worse - waking up in a different country and realizing that I\\'d been drooling on the person next to me the whole time or proceeding to loudly apologize to that person in a language they couldn\\'t understand.The 13-hour flight to Shanghai had left me drowsy, confused, and wondering why I had decided to travel 5,783 miles by myself to a country full of people speaking a language I could barely comprehend. Yet I found myself in China for an entire month. It was this month that changed my entire perspective of my identity as a Chinese-American.Upon landing, I scanned the suffocating crowds of Chinese people for an exit. A ball of anxiety formed in my stomach as I struggled to see my way out. Everywhere I looked there were signs covered in strange characters and mediocre English translations that, having just come off of a traumatizing flight, I was in no position to try to interpret. Eventually, I escaped the airport and was escorted by my aunt and cousin to my grandparents\\' small apartment complex where I was immediately bombarded with questions in Shanghainese, a dialect of Chinese too different from the Mandarin I was used to.As a first generation American who had little knowledge about my cultural roots in China, adjusting to this foreign way of life was difficult. Yet by just the second week, my fluency in the language had grown. From my dearth of knowledge of the Chinese culture arose an enthusiasm to embrace it. Out of curiosity, I accompanied my aunt to work with the idea that I\\'d apply for an internship there. It was a daring move, I must admit, but with my newfound eagerness to learn more about my native language and culture, it was a step I was willing to take. This proved to be one of the most important decisions I\\'d made in my 18 years of life.My first few days at the bank were rocky. The other employees looked at me like I was an inept, fresh-off-the-boat child. The instructions that the manager gave me were all in Chinese and I struggled to follow him. I approached customers with caution and provided little insight to their questions. I bothered the employees for advice on practically everything including simple tasks such as how to work the ATM machine and how to dial the phone. However, I returned each day making sure that I could do something better than the day before, whether it be helping a customer set up a bank account or dealing with a forgotten pin number.By the end of the month, I was speaking casually to the customers and joking with my co-workers about subjects I could only dream of understanding had I not taken the leap into the Chinese community. There were no longer periods of silence, inexplicable gestures, or awkward involuntary instances of circumlocution. Rather, I could go around conversing with people and they would be shocked if I told them I had lived in America my whole life.The leap I took that summer was one that left me with not only a better understanding of the country I came from, but also that with a little perseverance, I could push myself to new limits that would have otherwise been out of my reach. Without this experience at the bank, I never would have discovered what the Chinese language could open my eyes to. As difficult as the journey was, the result was something that I can treasure and continue to build upon. As the Chinese proverb goes, \\'w\\\\u00e0nsh\\\\u00ec kait\\\\u00f3u n\\\\u00e0n; All things are difficult before they are easy.\\'\"}, {\"index\": 279, \"new_personal_statement\": \" My faith has shaped me to be who I am. Some fundamental aspects of life I feel have been influenced by Christianity include how I speak, think, and act. The Bible acts like a compass forme when I read the Ten Commandments or scripture from the book of Proverbs, guiding me to follow a path in life that goes in accordance to its teachings. When I speak I am conscientious of the power my tongue holds, and I try to use it to encourage others rather than to bring them down. My thoughts are reinforced by reading the Bible, which helps remind me that anything is possible with the Lord and that through Him I have strength to face the challenges in my life, no matter how difficult they may be. Although circumstances may not always be favorable, I believe everything happens for a purpose and makes oneself grow in the faith. In reference to how I act, the Bible has provided me with a set of good moral values to live by, some of which include not falling into temptation, cheating, lying, or stealing. The commandment \\'love your neighbor as yourself\\' has taught me to respect others and view them as a brother or sister so I may help and care for them.In addition, Christianity gives me hope and faith for what the future holds. I have learned through God\\'s word that I have a purpose and a path awaiting me. Furthermore, to progress in my path I must reflect on past mistakes to surpass similar obstacles in the future. Christianity does not avoid reality but instead recognizes that there will be adversities. However, I see these hardships as a test to my faith and to the achievement of my future goals that I must pass. I believe Christianity will help me be a positive influence to those around me in the college community as well as myself, knowing that I have the capacity to succeed with my education if I use characteristics of my mentality that I have learned from my faith; for example, be tenacious to reach a goal in mind, be humble when I am rewarded for my work to remain focused, and be content even in the face of struggle, knowing that the Lord is with me always. After I graduate, I see myself better prepared to face the world as it is, for by then I will have passed difficulties faced in college and will be a more complete person, and the biggest factor I believe attributes to this is my faith.\"}, {\"index\": 280, \"new_personal_statement\": \"NNNN\"}, {\"index\": 281, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Steadily holding my mechanical pencil, I meticulously sketch out the delicate petals of peonies. As I finish erasing the stray marks from the elaborate line art, I am ready to apply the watercolors. The shades of pink, red, and yellow swirl together into beautiful and subtle shades of lavender, amaranth, and tango. Each base pigment mingles into a synergy of vivid color. They are the shades and hues that represent the different aspects of my experience as an artist. From the five-minute sketches in my notebook to the five-month long masterpieces hanging on my wall, these components of my art experience have collectively shaped me into who I am today.My interest in art developed in third grade when I was introduced to Japanese comics and animation, respectively known as manga and anime. The smooth brush strokes, the precise lines, and the finely cut screen-tones mesmerized me. I loved how manga artists were able to create such detailed characters, environments, and stories. I started imitating various styles of different manga artists and creating original characters and settings. I hoped someday to reach their level of artistic skill and create a manga of my own.By eighth grade, I decided to take my hobby more seriously. I started taking art classes outside of school at Visionary Arts. The small and cozy studio was full of students sitting in front of their easels, studying the dancing shadows on a famous bust, or intently looking at the spots of light reflected from a clear glass of water. As I looked at the intricate illustrations hanging in every corner of the room, I remembered my own simple cartoon style. I felt very out of place in this professional environment. The freehanded scribbles that I drew did not compare to the realistic portfolios that these students had refined and perfected.Although I still drew in a manga style on my own time, I diligently participated in developing my skills in the traditional style offered at the studio. I started with a set of graphite pencils, which gave my art more depth than any cheap mechanical pencil could achieve. Once I had mastered black and white drawings, I moved on to painting and watercolor to infuse my illustrations with vibrant color. We drew various objects: a cube, a glass of water, a basket full of white lilies. We observed the framework, the boundaries and shadows, the reflection of the colors, and transferred them onto paper. These skills were the basic building blocks of drawing. They are necessary for any kind of art, regardless of the style or medium. Through my classes at the studio, I was able to grasp these skills and use them for my own drawings and develop my own unique style. These classes were the wings that taught me how to fly, and now I am able to soar on my own, into the vast expanse of my imagination. After five years, the art studio has become my home and my escape from reality. Here, I am able to unwind and focus on filling the blank canvas sitting in front of me. As I look upon the younger students who are struggling to draw a cube, I realize that I have become one of the \\'professionals\\' that I once looked up to when I was their age.I have realized that the road of an artist stretches for miles. I smile to myself, I take out my watercolors, I set up my workspace, and I begin to draw.\"}, {\"index\": 282, \"new_personal_statement\": \"     I\\'ve known from a young age that I wanted to work in medicine, and innovation drives the field christened by Asclepius. I joined my school\\'s Health Occupation Students of America club in my sophomore year to be among other hopeful physicians. Members of the club choose one event and compete in it at various levels, depending on success in the previous levels. My event is a five-minute group presentation of a groundbreaking medical innovation, and in my first year competing, I killed it. In my second year, it killed me.      After wrangling up a group, we chose the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018medical innovation\\' event on a whim, and we certainly never expected to go as far as we did. My public speaking is incredibly poor; I had to memorize my speech to the letter and recite it in monotone. My hands shook and my voice wavered as I talked on the benefits and disadvantages of targeted cancer therapy. The judges must have seen something in us though, because we placed first at regionals, first at state, and third at nationals. In retrospect, I should have known that placing nationally against a hundred teams would inflate my ego and make failure inevitable. But winning was so empowering that I needed to do it again; adrenaline and arrogance fueled me for weeks afterwards.      But when junior year came and we were to sign up for our events again, something felt different. My new team still tried incredibly hard; we put more hours into this short presentation than we had of any project or class in the past. The topic of our presentation was a new and truly innovative approach to stem cells, a technique devised to create stem cells from adult cells, not embryonic cells. But come the state competition, our best efforts just weren\\'t enough. We were missing a member and the presentation was disjointed. My nerves caused my voice to shake and stutter. Of the five groups receiving honorable mention, we did not place. It might not technically be a failure, but it was no success. I had expected the world and came away with nothing.     After my loss I was disappointed in myself and resentful towards my team. It didn\\'t help that the rest of my school\\'s chapter was dripping in gold. I had secretly been planning my return trip to nationals, and when I knew it would not come to fruition, I felt defeated. Instead of my vision of fine tuning an epic presentation and confidently strutting on to a stage to receive gold, I saw myself bored and sweltering at home all summer, with no goal to reach and no way to occupy my mountains of free time. I felt like I had reached the end of my line.      In the midst of my wallowing I applied for a summer job at the municipal pool. I worked there for the summer as a cashier and slide monitor, and I gained two things HOSA could never have given me: cash to spend and a tan to flaunt. I learned how to work with people who aren\\'t highly driven students or teachers banking on my success, but regular people just trying to create a fun summer memory with their kids. It took me away from my obsession with academics and brought me into the world of work, where no one is concerned with grades, ACT scores or medical profession competitions.      From my success and subsequent loss at the same competitive event I learned something I had heard from my father my whole life: you win some, you lose some. Winston Churchill put it more eloquently when he described success as \\'stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.\\' I learned that some things I hold so highly aren\\'t the end all. I also know now that no one will hold you to one failure, but everyone loathes a sore loser.\"}, {\"index\": 283, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Come in, mamalah!\\' I timidly followed Mrs. Solomon into the kitchen, where I was engulfed by the smell of brisket and potatoes. As I stepped into the crowded dining room, my heart racing and my palms sweaty, I was overwhelmed with hugs and kisses from strangers. Trying not to attract too much attention to myself, I quietly sat down at the dinner table. That evening, the Solomon family was hosting me at their home in Sydney, Australia for the Passover Seder.My decision to travel to Sydney during Passover for the World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships was anything but easy. I was torn between my sentimental attachment to observe the holiday at home, as I had always done, and my ambition to test my academic skills on an international stage.My \\'Bubby\\' and \\'Zadie\\' (Yiddish for grandmother and grandfather) host the Passover Seder every year. The entire house radiates with warmth from the ovens and fills with the scent of Bubby\\'s culinary delights, including piping hot bowls of matzo ball soup and crispy potato kugel. The guest list is a kaleidoscope of quirky characters. Among them, my cousin \\'Magic\\' Stu, Uncle Tat, who did a stint upstate, and his ex-wife Barbara who still makes a cameo at the Seder ten years after their divorce (they usually sit at opposite ends of the table\\\\u2026scowling at each other).Upon qualifying for \\'Worlds\\' and discovering the Passover conflict, I began to experience a whirlwind of mixed emotions. On the one hand was my abiding affection for my family\\'s Seder, and on the other hand was the excitement and anticipation of the opportunity that awaited me halfway around the world. The sacrifices I had made to reach this achievement were considerable, and squandering this opportunity would have its own repercussions. I had to find the mettle to reconcile my emotions with my ambitions, accept a bit of anxiety and discomfort, and make the 9,000 mile trek. Could I do it? Taking this step felt a little like jumping off a cliff without knowing if there was warm water or hard rocks below.When my rational thinking returned, it dawned on me that I had overlooked a possible solution. So I located a Jewish family in Sydney, the Solomons, and invited myself to their Seder. My initial trepidation subsided as I began to notice the abundant commonalities between their customs and my own. Despite the absence of crazy ex-Aunt Barbara and brisket instead of Bubby\\'s chicken, the camaraderie of the Solomon family and their traditions were immensely comforting to me. I left their house around midnight, after hours of laughter and storytelling. I felt complete, like I had filled the void of Bubby and Zadie\\'s Seder.In Australia, I learned things about myself far more valuable than debate skills. The world is much larger than my Bubby\\'s kitchen. As I go through life, I will have to sacrifice what is familiar and comfortable in order to pursue new challenges. Sometimes it will be necessary to take a leap of faith, and I now have the confidence to do so. I learned to see my strong family ties and rich traditions as a basis upon which to expand my horizons, rather than as a limitation. Ultimately, I am incredibly grateful to have had this opportunity to explore these facets of my identity.\"}, {\"index\": 284, \"new_personal_statement\": \"When I was five, I learned a valuable lesson: make sure the toilet seat is down before sitting on it.I only realized my embarrassing mistake when I stood up and my pajamas were soaked. Although both the babysitter and my brother were home, I could not muster up the confidence to ask them for help with my drenched onesie. Growing up, the same juvenile attitude about not asking for help would often manifest itself. Whether it was having to ask for rides because my mom\\'s visual impairment forced her to stop driving or seek out my math teachers when I struggled, it always felt uncomfortable to impose on others for assistance. My issue with asking for and accepting help seemed to be rooted in a self-righteous crusade for independence. However, at the heart of it, my quest stemmed from a fear that I was not in control of my life. My daily routine became dictated by what other people were doing and how my needs fit into their busy lives. I found the thought of my friends and teachers going out of their ways to accommodate me to be demoralizing, even when they were glad to help.Until high school, I noticed myself wavering between the merits and shortcomings of asking for help. On the one hand, I was grateful for the help I received when I asked for it. On the other, I am burdened by my childhood of asking for rides and being dependent. However, my attitude would change after watching Henderson, the middle school student from the neighboring town that I tutor and mentor on Saturday mornings, achieve honor roll recognition for the first time. I realized not only the positive impact I could have on others, but also the profound impact that helping them would have on me. The feeling of providing assistance satisfied what I had thought was an insatiable yearning to repay my childhood favors. In this sense, helping people became not just something that I do; helping people is something that I need to do, and something that I love doing.While the honor roll was certainly an achievement for Henderson, it felt like a victory for me too. I finally understood the power of aiding others, and it became apparent to me why so many people were eager to help me. It wasn\\'t that they pitied me or were just doing me a favor; when they would give me a hand, they felt the same sense of gratification as I had when my student made the honor roll. In that regard, tutoring became my vehicle to offer Henderson scholastic rides. Perhaps the greatest thing that helping Henderson taught me, however, was that I want to dedicate my life to public service. The satisfaction that I feel from helping has become somewhat of an obsession for me; whether it is raising over $25,000 for the Foundation Fighting Blindness or traveling to Vietnam to build houses, offering an outstretched hand is my passion. I believe that there is no professional career that holds a higher ability to help people than being a politician. In reality, the everyday decisions that lawmakers make could potentially have a meaningful impact on not only the citizens of the United States but also everyone globally. Henderson doesn\\'t know it, but he inadvertently inspired my career choice. I would like to be a political leader so that I can make a difference in everybody\\'s lives. Eleven years ago, I failed to put the toilet seat down and ask for assistance. Yet only from my insistence on independence would I, later on, realize the virtue of help. Now, whenever I leave the bathroom, I always make sure the toilet seat is down to help others avoid the same unfortunate mistake I made in my youth.\"}, {\"index\": 285, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'These are terrible,\\' I mutter as I cross out another couple of lines. \\'Nobody would listen to this song.\\' Another fruitless brainstorming session, stuck at the piano with chord progressions and key signatures running through my head\\\\u2014but no words.

Nevertheless, for all of the music surrounding my life, I cannot write the right words for a worthy original composition. To explain why I am in such a dilemma, I must first elaborate on my musical history. Music has been one of the greatest influences throughout my life. For about as long as I can remember, I have been trained in classical piano. Normally kids younger than second grade do not take lessons, but somehow my parents sweet-talked the teacher into giving me a chance when I was only in kindergarten. Unfortunately, I was not one of those childhood prodigies, nor did I have perfect pitch. I did have one thing going for me though: I was raised to appreciate music. My dad was a country music enthusiast, my mother played some saxophone, and they played \\'Jazz Nightly\\' on National Public Radio as I fell asleep each night. This appreciation drove my determination to be good at piano. Two hours of practice a night, every night\\\\u2014that is what it took to move up just one skill level each year. Now, twelve years later, every one of those painstaking hours has paid off, and my piano skills are not too shabby. Slightly easier was choral music. My love for singing came mostly from my father, who, as I mentioned earlier, has an ear for country music. This held true for both the genre and for the literal country where we live. One of my earliest memories is singing \\'God Bless the USA\\' by Lee Greenwood with my dad for a Veteran\\'s Day program. That Christmas, he deployed to Iraq with the Army National Guard. I was in first grade. Another of my earliest memories is going home after watching him fly out and singing that song to myself until I was hoarse. That is exactly how I have approached singing ever since: applying myself fully and truly understanding the emotion behind the words I am saying. Between extensive experience in both piano and vocal music, I should have the experience and knowledge necessary to compose my own piece of music. Employing every tactic learned through music, I continue to strive toward this goal; I practice nearly every night, and the emotional connection is always real. I have poured hundreds of hours into this project, yet I feel as though I am not making any progress. Why is there no progress? I think that the answer is quite simple: I do not know everything about music. Think of music as a language. We must learn to read, speak, and write English. Well, I have already learned how to read and speak music\\\\u2014but not how to write it. My mistaken assumption was that the first two facets would automatically make me fluent in the third. The words are all there, and I know how to say them, but now I must begin learning how to use them in a completely new way. It will not be one great discovery or revelation but rather a slow gathering of understanding. Practice makes perfect, and I just have not had enough practice yet. I am sure that someday the words will finally organize themselves just the right way. I will smile and whisper to myself, \\'I think that\\'s a decent place to start.\\' The United States Military Academy is regarded as the premier leadership training program in the United States. Training officers for the Army is no small task, yet the Academy goes above and beyond, which shows through on a national scale. What many forget, however, is that these leaders are also some of the most academically gifted students from across the nation. Not only are these young men and women leaders, they are also intelligent. The reason why I wish to attend the US Military Academy is quite simple: I want to be an intelligent leader. As a high school student, I have developed a drive for leadership, and through practice, gained additional raw ability. Admission as a cadet, and the subsequent training to become an Army officer would mold this ability, and utilize it at a level which is unparalleled on the world stage. West Point transforms aptitude into a versatile skillset. I also strive towards understanding of concepts and consequences. Again and again, the USMA ranks among the most elite schools of learning across the country, proving that the education gained is truly full circle. Leadership without knowledge will lead to uninformed decisions, and potentially disastrous consequences. Knowledge without leadership will lack motivation and purpose. Combination of the two produces a formidable army with purpose and power. My goal is to become a part of that force.The other question to answer, is why the military? The full reason is actually two parts. To begin, I have grown up with an appreciation for service. My father is a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and my grandfather served as an airborne paratrooper in the early 1960s. This legacy of service in my family has cultured both pride for our country and respect for those who serve her have always been present in my life. Looking up to those selfless men and women has always motivated me, and I cannot pass by the opportunity to join their ranks. The second facet of my answer is just that I feel that it is my duty. Each citizen of our country has the responsibility to give back. Through my own experience, I believe that the most beneficial way for me to pay my respect to the country I live in is through service. My desire is to protect this country, and all that she stands for\\\\u2014for my generation, and the generations to come.The attached .mp3 file is part of the album that I released this summer in May 2018 with my a cappella group, The Harvard Din & Tonics. I am on solo for this song Wait for the Moment, with the other eleven members of my group (plus a background recording of myself) singing the backup track. I share this recording for two reasons. First, in a way I consider it the \\'magnum opus\\' of my two years of singing in the group since coming to college\\\\u2014if merely two years could yield such a thing. I am primarily a contemporary voice singer in practice (with some classical training), and the Din & Tonics are first and foremost a jazz group. Here we meet somewhere in the middle, covering a song by the funk band Vulfpeck. Secondly, I share this as an introduction to the other facets of work I have done with music since coming to college. In the last year, I have served as business manager for the group, managing a six-figure budget, and organizing both domestic and international tours. Currently, in fact, we are on our ten-week 2018 World Tour\\\\u2014performing songs from the aforementioned album that I was fortunate enough to be featured on\\\\u2014funded entirely by revenue from performances during the year which I served to coordinate as business manager. I have explored several areas of music performance, from my a cappella group\\'s jazz influence, to classical voice (in various state, regional, and national ACDA honor choirs, including being a 2015 ACDA National Honor Choir alumnus), and have incorporated aspects of each into my own work. I am applying to Berklee primarily because I am seeking to bring my own contemporary composition and singing style to the next step. I hope you enjoy the recording, and please contact me with any questions you have about its production, or of my musical ventures.\"}, {\"index\": 286, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I have to do it. I inched closer to the door, each movement made with increasing hesitation. What if it\\'s just like last time? My mind launched into a frenzy of self-degrading hypothetical situations, all of which ended in defeat. I couldn\\'t back down. Not again. Adrenaline rushing through my body, I took a deep breath and turned the cold, shiny doorknob.I could have began with a simple \\'hello\\' or a friendly \\'what\\'s up?\\'Instead, I opened with a joke I had found on the back of a Laffy Taffy wrapper, something I expected to be a sure-fire hit: \\'Why was the cat afraid of the tree? Because of its bark!\\'I looked around at the other children in the room, awaiting a response that never came. They shrugged, looked down, and continued to shove rosogolla and pani puri into their mouths. My apprehensions proven true, I returned to my isolated corner in the room across the hall, fidgeting with an unsolved Rubik\\'s cube.I was twelve years old, and failing to make friends my age at Bangladeshi dinner parties had become the norm. Failing to make friends anywhere had become the norm.Growing up, I tottered between my Bangladeshi and American identities. I struggled to find friends similar to myself because I hadn\\'t yet understood who I was. I was too Bangladeshi for Americans, and too American for Bangladeshis. I felt an obligation to wholly conform to one group, one that wasn\\'t entirely me. Everything changed, however, when I picked up a copy of The Velvet Underground & Nico from the five-dollar bin at an electronics store. I found the cover visually appealing, so I listened in hopes of it being sonically appealing as well. From that moment on, I became hooked\\\\u2014not only on the Velvet Underground, but on indie music as a whole.In the midst of my internal conflict, indie music\\'s individualistic platform lured me in. The music was characterized by the musicians\\' relentless ambition to break out of the confinement of everyday life, just as I craved to break free from conformity. As I became increasingly engrossed in the culture surrounding indie music, I became increasingly unconstrained in my attitude and my thinking. I found refuge. I was different, and I liked it.My burgeoning appreciation for indie music sparked a new sense of curiosity in me. It began with basic questions and progressed into more insightful ones:\\'What if the artist put this note next to that one instead?\\'\\'How would the meaning of this song change if the artist used that instrument instead?\\'\\'How would this song play out if it had been written ten years earlier or ten years later?\\' I learned to play the guitar and the piano so I could meticulously craft my own simple yet intricate compositions, emulating those of the Strokes. Radiohead\\'s profound lyricism exposed me to complex ideologies like existentialism and political corruption, which I began to ponder for myself. Through exploring Car Seat Headrest\\'s lyrical allusions to literary works and histories such as Ovid\\'s Metamorphoses and the life of William Butler Yeats, I reflected on both the mundanities and complexities of life. I spent late nights with a Portuguese-English dictionary after listening to Rodrigo Amarante, trying to comprehend each bit of the beautiful language. I delved into the the mathematics behind music and analyzed algorithms and patterns used in LCD Soundsystem\\'s songs. Indie music shaped my approach on everything I did, in academics and beyond.Indie music not only allowed me to express my identity but also influenced it on a fundamental level. My fascination with the genre and the culture surrounding it has shaped my personality and allowed me to grow into the best version of myself. It transformed me from a tense, apprehensive child into a free-thinking individual who can illuminate any room with enlightening eccentricity.\"}, {\"index\": 287, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The Rainbow After the Storm My fingers were racing across the keyboard as I put the final touches on my English paper when all of a sudden\\\\u2014BAM!\\\\u2014my laptop went still.

Helpless, I prayed that my work would be saved as I waited for the wheel of doom to cease spinning.On January 5th, 2015, there came another spinning rainbow pinwheel in my life. A time when everything seemed to have frozen, and all seemed to be lost.\\'-----, you\\'ve crushed your lower back bone,\\' the doctor softly told me.The doctors had never seen a break like this before\\\\u2014I had collided with the skiing tower with such force that my L5 vertebra shattered completely.

But then they added, \\'only with the help of a back brace for 3 months.\\' 3 months?! Greed began to topple euphoria. \\'When can I resume my activities? Dancing? Running? Tennis?\\' I intently asked my doctor. Looking into my anxious eyes, at the X-ray films, and then back into my eyes, he hesitated, \\'6 months.\\' My heart dropped. But I knew, I had to be strong for my worried parents. I put on a smile, joked about how fashionable my back brace was, and tried to move on with life. \\'I\\'m fine,\\' I told my friends. \\'I\\'m great,\\' I reassured my teammates.\\'I\\'m okay,\\' I convinced my family.It was only in the confines of my bedroom where I allowed the tears to flow. \\'Fine\\' I was not. Everything that I had worked so hard for had been snatched away from me. My whirlwind of activity had been replaced with an unsettling stillness. And the free time that I had once longed for became nothing but a cruel reminder of my broken dreams. I felt worthless.It was only after weeks of introspection that I realized how wrong I was.The accident had actually been a blessing in disguise. Although it didn\\'t seem like it at first, I had actually been given one of the most valuable gifts: time. Time to think about my life. Time to reflect on how fortunate I was. And most importantly, time to rest\\\\u2014both physically and mentally. Rest\\\\u2026so important, yet so underappreciated: the blinks that grant our eyes respite, the commas that give our thoughts a pause, and even the loading icons that freeze our computers. Likewise, it was my skiing accident that forced me to take a step back and actually think about my life. I was reminded that I am not defined by how busy of a lifestyle I live. As a person who constantly pushes herself to do more, this wasn\\'t an easy lesson for me to swallow; I never realized how much I would miss running at the crack of dawn, the late night dance rehearsals, and even the long tennis matches. Unable to do these things, I felt like I had lost pieces of my identity. It took weeks of reflection to understand that my worth isn\\'t based on the activities I partake in; it\\'s based on the values these activities have taught me. For instance, even though I wasn\\'t able to physically run, so long as I still had the drive, discipline, and determination that running had taught me\\\\u2014I would still be me. This was an invaluable lesson that my moment of rest allowed me to uncover. So once in a while, it\\'s good to have these spinning rainbow pinwheels in our lives.

A look of confusion, often accompanied by a slight chuckle, is the typical reaction to the words brazenly posted at our front door. While it takes my teammates a few seconds to process the words before following the instructions, this action is wholly instinctive to me, a marker of my Asian-American heritage and identity.As a young boy, I excitedly put on a pair of strange new shoes for the first time, one with shiny blades attached to the bottom, and since then my skates have been glued to my feet for thousands of hours. I lace them up daily in order to adopt an identity greater than myself. Yet each year, I was met with a sense of unease as hockey, my home away from home, came into contact with my real, physical home.For far too long, the feeling that overcame me as I walked into the rink was identical to the one I experienced when my teammates read that sign: a pressing need to explain, and even justify, my culture. And it was for good reason. Before my worn skates even touch the ice, I am an anomaly. Sometimes due to my lofty height, or my bit-too-lanky-for-a-hockey-player arms, but always due to my race. My background. My last name.Ice hockey, though played globally, is far from a bastion of diversity. I have been the only Asian American on all of my teams but one; in fact, I was the first one to ever be listed on my school roster. Such forces against me, I naturally shied away from my heritage, responding to racial epithets with anger and self-doubt. But progressing through high school, I found myself slowly but surely coming to terms with my identity. My expanding social circle, my first Korean best friend included, constantly reminded me that belonging is not contingent on race. My sister\\'s tight-knit group of senioritis-inflicted best friends, though a bit too rowdy in our living room, inspired me with their acceptance of one another\\'s mixed backgrounds and sexual orientations. Watching my mother (who hasn\\'t been a student in 27 years, let alone in a foreign language) boldly pursue a Master\\'s degree, I felt a surge of unprecedented pride in my Asian blood.On January 31, 2014, in a game against Bellarmine Preparatory School, I was met by the words: \\'What are you gonna do, you chink?\\'The remark was vulgar but one I had already heard countless times. Yet for the first time, I no longer felt the same physical rage I always had, nor did I question my place in this sport. I simply smiled. Behind my grin was not only than sarcastic indifference, but more importantly a newfound understanding and appreciation of my idiosyncratic status in the hockey world. Perhaps it was simply years of discrimination that had built an emotional barrier against such invidious treatment. Looking back, however, I can confidently say that it was something much greater: The journey to appreciate my own culture has brought me here, a time in my life when I no longer worry about my race or fitting a certain mold. Today I take immense pride in representing the culture that has shaped and bred me: I am proud of my home regardless of its barefoot policy, and I am just as proud to be who I am in the rink, my second home.I am an Asian-American. And I am a hockey player. Whether I am putting on my bladed shoes at the rink or taking off my regular shoes at my front door, I know I am at home.

If there was one thing that my sixteen year old self remembered from third grade science, it was that las pira\\\\u00f1as are the most dangerous species of fish in the Amazon River. The fact that I was in a canoe at all, spending five days in the Amazon jungle, was astounding. For weeks beforehand, I had agonized over whether this trip was worth it. Luckily, Mayela, my Peruvian host mom, was a sympathetic listener as I rattled off a list of imagined fears and worst-case scenarios.What if I got bitten by a rabies-infected bat in my sleep? What if the recommended twenty-eight malaria pills in that skinny orange bottle gave me terrible side effects? What if I found tarantulas in my sleeping quarters? What if I got hurt? Lost?

As the deadline for registration crept closer, I channeled the panic into lists of pros and cons. At the last minute, I decided that I couldn\\'t refuse this opportunity to see a part of the world my ten year old self had only read about in Britannica Online. I walked out the front door with my duffel bag in hand, ignoring the pit in my stomach. That is how I ended up standing on the edge of a canoe in the middle of the Amazon River, debating whether or not I should throw myself into a body of water known to be inhabited by piranhas. I felt my feet leave the canoe before I even realized I had made the decision to jump. All doubts disappeared the second I was in the air. I heard the elated shouts of my friends, and when my head came up out of the cool water, I spotted a rainbow above the green horizon. Risk-taking was never one of my fortes. My decision to spend a year between tenth and eleventh grade in South America as an exchange student came as a shock to family and friends alike. \\'Joy\\'s going to Peru for a whole year?\\' It was a sort of rebellion against myself. I tried new foods like cow heart and guinea pig and performed a salsa routine in front of my school. I haggled with crooked taxi drivers and confronted those who assumed just by looking at me that I was everything but American. I rebelled against my timid and indecisive nature by jumping into piranha-filled waters on a daily basis.I eventually came to realize that the fear before the jump- whether it be a split-second moment or drawn-out eternity- is far worse than the actual leap. And though taking the leap may lead to a tiring swim to catch up with the boat, it will hardly ever lead to regret. I\\'ve learned from experience that not taking the leap is what leads to regret. Equipped with this newfound knowledge, I returned to the U.S. and dove headfirst into a sea of new endeavors. I designed a school-wide project to promote diversity and inclusiveness. I frequented the city to participate in social and political protests. I ran for class treasurer, lost, then became vice president and treasurer of my two favorite clubs. I have not suddenly been reborn a skilled and fearless risk-taker. In a room full of people, I am still not the one with the loudest voice, or the most outgoing. But beneath this quiet exterior is an adventurous spirit, not one to shy away from the unknown, from trying new things. So the next time I find myself in a crowded canoe, I will be the first to jump.

As a young child, I reveled in the extra attention and thought about how great it would be that my son would have the same privilege.As I got older, things started to change. In elementary school, I would swoon with the girls over pictures of Justin Timberlake. Even though I was the only boy, I thought it was a normal bonding experience with my female classmates. It was not until I was 15 that I noticed I was blushing around JungWoo. I would get butterflies in my stomach whenever I was around him and would fantasize about kissing him and pressing my body tightly against his. When JungWoo started to consume my dreams and every waking moment, I knew I was gay.While thoughts of Hankyu brought happiness, I was worried about having my secret revealed. I was scared of my family\\'s reaction and feared that they would send me to a shaman for \\'curative\\' treatments. I replayed in my mind the image of my father with his buried brows and sunken lips telling me how disappointed he was in me for dashing his dreams and bringing shame to the family\\'s name. I could also see my grandmother praying to our ancestors to forgive this abomination. This even led me to think about marrying a girl, living a heteronormative existence and giving the Phan family a male heir.Before I could think about the future, I had to worry about the present. To compensate for my father\\'s looming disappointment, I worked extremely hard to make him proud by excelling at every subject and being the top student at my school.

Like my body which cannot be changed, I have come to accept and love my sexual identity. While living this daily lie, the few places where I could be true to myself is through the arts, both visual and performing. Within the visual arts, I love how my charcoal pencil allows me to express the sensuality of the male figure from the muscular chest to the strong hands to the flaccid male anatomical features. On stage, I find myself at ease playing the part of the distraught Shakespearean characters who lead double lives. Through my portrayal of Olivia in Twelfth Night or my portraits, I am screaming to the world that I am attracted to men. Yet, all they see are the artistic merits of my works and performances. Given the stigma against homosexuality in Vietnam and in my family, I am still not ready to share my secret. However, with each passing day, I know that my fears and anxiety will soon dissipate as I attend college in America, a community that will look past my sexual orientation and accept me. Knowing the struggles and loneliness of hiding in the closet, I want to create an environment where closeted individuals can express their true self.With the confidence of coming out in America, I hope to then come back to Vietnam and kneel in front of my ancestors\\' altars with my adopted son and hear their spirits tell us that they love us for who we are.I observed Nam\\'s darting eyes across the canteen hall. After being shooed from table to table, Nam finally arrived at mine. \\'Uhhh is this seat t-t-taken\\', he stammered. Nam was new at school and had trouble fitting in. His stuttering did not help as kids would make fun of him when they are not shunning him. Having once been the frail new kid, I was able to empathize with his vulnerabilities and invited him to sit with my friends and me. As I got to know him, I learned how he was looking forward to our Seussical production. Hearing this, I floated the idea of him being a participant. Naturally, given his stuttering, he fervently objected.I reassured him that the thespian family was different. Since every members is critical for a production\\'s success, there is an intense sense of camaraderie, acceptance and love. After some prodding, Nam reluctantly agreed to take a speaking role. I helped him rehearse his lines and taught him the rhythmic acting method. When the day came, he delivered a flawless performance and beamed with pride. Off-stage, I work with disadvantaged children. Similar to Nam, I sought to give them acceptance and normalcy. As Nam had been stigmatized for his stuttering, I saw similar ostracization of disabled children by their physically \\'abled\\' peers at the various homeless shelters where I volunteered. These children are often relegated to playing alone at the corners of the room. Dejected by what I saw, I sought to give these physical disabled children a chance at a normal life. Thus, I connected them with a prosthetics organisation where I was working. Together with a group of volunteers, we produced personalised 3D-prosthethics limbs for these children. Made to look like superhero arms, these prosthetics hands allowed the children to feel extra special. The smiles on their faces were priceless. An African proverb states \\'It Takes a Village\\' to raise a child. As a member of the village called humanity, I will continue to look out for all children in this village to give them a sense of belonging regardless of abilities. \"}, {\"index\": 302, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Her big brown eyes gazed at me as I entered. I wanted to look around, take it all in, but her gaze was compelling, and I couldn\\'t look away. Her name was Aya, and she was 11, and her eyes were fixated directly on me. Seeing our interaction, her mom started sharing Aya\\'s story. While Aya was walking home from school with her best friend, a bomb hit, killing her friend right in front of her. She had not spoken in a full year since the incident. As her mother spoke, I stared at Aya, and for the first time in my life, felt truly helpless.Since 2011, I\\'d witnessed the aftermath of the Syrian Civil War on the streets of Istanbul, Turkey, through the constant trickle of besieged refugees begging in the streets. I was 15, and this trip visiting Aya made me realize that what I had been seeing in my hometown was only a small portion of a broader picture to which I was blind. Previously, I\\'d applied to various organizations asking for a chance to help, but they all gave me the same reply: \\'You\\'re too young.\\' After doing research, I learned that one of the greatest refugee populations in Turkey was in Gaziantep: a short two-hour flight from Istanbul. That\\'s how I found myself in Aya\\'s house during my winter break.I don\\'t believe in miracles. As a realist, I trust anything can be achieved by hard work, but on that day, I found myself questioning these principles and wishing for a miracle. Throughout my life, I\\'ve always felt lucky, having an excellent education and stable home life to be grateful for. Even though my country is beset by political unrest and I experienced the beginning of a civil war this summer, I grew up surrounded by different cultures, religions, and languages, in a family that always gives me a chance to pursue amazing opportunities. Counting my own blessings, I wanted to help children like Aya, to give them their hopes and dreams back, and to raise awareness about Syrian refugees in my country. More importantly, I wanted to create the opportunity for others like me to help as well.Upon my return to boarding school, I founded an NGO, the Give A Hand Organization, and enlisted the help of my friends and the local community. The next summer (2015), after receiving sponsorship from Hasan Kalyoncu University, a local university in Gaziantep, ten of my friends and I traveled to Gaziantep to help Aya and other refugee children for fifteen days. Such small gestures as delivering food, playing educational games and offering the children comfort they had so long been missing made a true difference.\\'Are you coming again tomorrow?\\'A voice I\\'d never heard. Aya. The first words in over a year.I\\'d witnessed a true miracle. At that instant, I knew I wanted to expand Give A Hand. By pitching my goals and successes to local universities and major firms, I raised $120,000 for students around the world to come volunteer. By the end of summer 2016, we\\'d built a library, two child-friendly spaces, and a playground for Syrian refugee children. We\\'d grown to a community of forty-five student volunteers from five different high schools, with 27 Syrian refugee children registered under Give A Hand as our little siblings, whose education we would support until they attended college.This summer, one of the organizations (ASAM) that had originally told me that I was too young collaborated with Give A Hand. I subsequently gave a presentation about Give A Hand to the Foreign Service and Cultural Affair officers of the American Consulate. Give A Hand opened my eyes to the idea that being \\'too young\\' or \\'too inexperienced\\' does not and should not outweigh following your passion.Now I know that miracles are not only real but very possible...with the right inspiration.\"}, {\"index\": 303, \"new_personal_statement\": \"For the first eight years of my life, I attended Divine Liturgy at the Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church every Sunday. By any measure, I was a model Orthodox Christian: at four, I could light prayer candles and kiss icons without my mother having to lift me up, and at six, I was able to recite the Nicene Creed in English and in Greek. Some of my closest friends and family were members of my congregation, so the culture and community of that church was where I felt most secure. Early on, I became fully committed to God, even though I was arguably too young to understand what that even meant. That argument is how my parents justified severing my deep ties with my faith when I was barely in third grade: when the constant demands of their newly opened restaurant took priority in their lives, they thought removing me from the church prevented pushing a religion on me that they felt I was unable to comprehend. Nine years later, while sitting in a Greek Orthodox Church in Athens, Greece - of all places - the weight of this decision finally hit me. I cautiously roamed the city, hoping to take in the thousands of years of history that surrounded me; I quickly found that history presented itself best in the lavishly decorated churches and shrines located on each street corner - golden crosses, intricate icons, and towering sculptures were common. These shrines drew the attention of many, some with heads bowed in deep prayer, and some with cameras artfully angled to capture the best possible photograph. But the churches were different. Tourists and residents alike treated the ancient church as sacred. Every time I passed a church, I\\'d feel a rush of nostalgia as I remembered the Sundays spent running on lush green lawns, cracking red eggs, and baking Greek dishes in the kitchen for the traditional after-Liturgy meal. However, after almost a decade of not attending service, I felt that entering any one of these churches would be an intrusion on a culture that was no longer my own - a culture that no longer welcomed me. The church that had once been such a significant part of my life had become just as foreign as the country I was in.Despite my fears, I had resolved to enter at least one church before I left the country; there was one church that stood out, and as I passed it every day, I had begun to develop with it a strong sense of familiarity. The exterior was unassuming: the walls were ripe with age and the detailed carvings had crumbled. I sat on the steps as I tried to build up the courage to enter. Thirty minutes of indecisiveness later, I opened the doors. Instantly, the smell of myrrh incense and burning beeswax candles overwhelmed me. Lacking traditional stained glass windows, the nave was illuminated by only the flames of the hundreds of prayer candles scattered throughout. I quickly fell into what were once familiar rituals. I kissed the hanging icons of Saint George. I crossed myself three times. To quell the unwelcome anxiety forming in the pit of my stomach, I collapsed into a pew. Nerves and fears consumed me, and I dealt with this deluge of emotion in the only way I thought was appropriate: I prayed. With my head bowed and eyes closed, save for the tears that fell, I prayed for faith and I prayed for guidance. Two hours later, when I left to return to my hotel, I realized just how wrong I\\'d been: the church was still my home. Ironically, returning to the religious purity of my childhood is what finally marked my transition to adulthood within my culture. I returned to America with a total rededication to my faith, determination to return to the church of my childhood, and significantly tanner skin.\"}, {\"index\": 304, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Burn after reading\\' The conservative society which I live in has always made me feel inferior and wanted me to constantly prove legitimacy of being who I am. Others took it for granted, but I felt the need to catch it unaware with the most unpredictable armor I could find.

However, she was invaded by sexists, whom I have repeatedly witnessed claiming that women are not suitable for it. \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018You\\'d better take dance classes!\\'- This kind of commentsI\\'ve heard from people who blindly believed that neither I was good for math.

Perhaps, I was born under the sign of Science because studying math I was still questioning myself: \\'What else can I do?\\' \\\\u2013 \\'Biology, biology\\', echoed my mind.One particular winter storm has brought a breeze of change. I remember reading the Goethe\\'s Faust and reflecting on the Mephistopheles of my own society, which wanted me to become blind and sell my soul. I could not surrender, but my life turned into an endless search for new weapons, and haunted by the burden of high responsibility, I saw everything but the light. Filling blackboards with intricate equations during the Olympiad training sessions, I was driven by the fear to make mistakes or cause disappointment, rather than by the adventurous spirit of discovery. Something had to change; I wanted back the girl who always proposed the craziest problem solutions and was excited to dive into the unknown. Thus, I have been introduced to Donna Biology- passionate, experienced, she enthralled me with her unique theories and revealed the beauty of our existence. I was initiated into the secrets of life and could understand functioning of the most complex mechanisms in nature. It is this Renaissance woman, whom I owe the ability to see beyond the flaws of our world. That winter storm caught a fire in my heart. Instead of trying to shut down the haters and annihilate the dark that will always persist, I was eager to fight for creating more light. I chose to find inspiration in the world and believe that my performance will inspire someone else. Like Goethe\\'s Italian journey was a door that brought a famous writer into the world of science and lead to some important discoveries, Biology has been a desired escape from my ordinary role. It was my door to self- discovery, my \\'trip to Italy\\', which in the end became a victorious trip to Vietnam, to the International Biology Olympiad.Who am I, a brave Spartan vindicating a noble purpose or an artist inciting others to change their values?

I was certain of it. Based on the fact that I was surrounded by white people at school, saw white people on TV, and only saw white people in my city, why would I think otherwise? The fact that I saw a brown girl looking back at me in the mirror and had an entirely Indian family did not change that. I was white. No doubt about it. That mindset lasted for ten years. Nine years ago, I was forced into a classical Indian dance class by my parents. Naturally, this confused me, as who would put a white girl in an Indian dance class? However, for the first time, I wasn\\'t the only brown skinned girl in the room. In fact, there were about thirty other girls who looked just like me and proudly called themselves Indian. This is when I started to rewrite my ethnic identity. In my sophomore year, I trained three hours a day for fifteen months in order to complete my Arangetram. This was a final performance as a conclusion of my learning of the classical Indian dance form, Bharatanatyam, for nine years. I worked harder than I had thought possible and finally accomplished a three hour long solo-dance performance, having the bruises under my pink and purple costume to prove it. In my junior year, I saw my skin for what it really was, brown and beautiful. I started an Indian Student Union at my school and raised awareness of Indian culture in what is still a fairly racially homogenous school. Creating an Indian Student Union and giving presentations on my own cultural daily life was freeing and thoroughly helped me see my culture in a new light. At my junior prom, I wore a maang tikka (a piece of Indian head jewelry) with my American dress and had never felt more proud. In my senior year, I took all the Hindi I had taught myself and started to incorporate it into my own feature film script. If someone were to ask my family what my biggest accomplishment was, they would say my Arangetram.However, I would say it was the fact that through the process of 17 years, I finally started to look at myself in the mirror and embrace the Indian girl that looked back; that after 17 years I could dance to both classical Indian beats and modern Bollywood rhythm; that after 17 years I could conduct a full conversation in Hindi with no cultural pressure from my family; that after 17 years I could wear a maang tikka to prom.\"}, {\"index\": 306, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I can only tread for a little bit longer.

I try not to think about the fact that I am alone in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay right before a storm...Oh wait. I\\'m not alone. My capsized beginners\\' sailboat is condescendingly bobbing up and down a few yards away. I refuse to close my eyes. It\\'ll only allow my terrified imagination to run wild. Scared. Vulnerable.

The coast guard sees my newly erect boat all alone and soon sends a rescue ship to get me.I used my experience as a failed sailor as inspiration to overcome the fear and vulnerability associated with helplessness. I started practicing Kenpo Karate. I was not in constant mortal danger, but learning and practicing Kenpo gave me a sense of internal safety that diminished my fear of being powerless. I continued with martial arts, placing in national competitions, and beating the boys in my sparring class. Today, I am a third degree brown belt, and I am finally confident in my ability to protect myself. Unfortunately not everyone has that luxury. I saw kids like me, who were unable to stand up for themselves, and I saw in them a familiar young girl out in the open water of the Chesapeake Bay. So I became a karate teacher at my karate school. I taught boys and girls from 5-16 years old the basics and even advanced techniques of martial arts because I wanted to give them the same internal security that I desperately craved.I once again saw this vulnerability and helplessness in a fictional situation. As a defense attorney on my school\\'s Mock Trial team and I represented a highschool boy who was accused of murdering his band mate. He was young and fairly unaware of his rights and the justice system scared and confused him. It was his own personal Chesapeake Bay.While I knew this was a fictional case, the sentiment behind it was real. My experiences with defenselessness have been influential in my desire to help alleviate this feeling in other people. I aspire to be a criminal defense attorney in the future. As a mock trial attorney, I see defendants as those who are helplessly stuck in their situations without proper guidance or protection. People believe, like I did, that they are in over their heads and all alone in an unfamiliar environment. I am determined to give support and protection to those without it. To help them navigate the unknown. To help them present themselves in a way that others can understand. Alone, defendants do not have much help getting their side of the story out to use as defense. As an attorney, I will be committed to ensuring that my clients do not feel lost, stranded, and terrified of the unknown: whether that be their rights, the legal process, or in my case the Chesapeake Bay.\"}, {\"index\": 307, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it hasinfluenced you.

Others were admirably drawing pictures of their parents while I struggled to remember what I had said several years ago.

At our family dinners I heard that Pasteur said \\'chance favors the prepared mind,\\' and learned that Einstein believed that \\'inspiration comes to the prepared mind.\\'  At first, while in grade school, I did not understand, nor did I care.  By age thirteen, however, I had begun to appreciate something about what they - Pasteur, Einstein, and my dad - meant. As if just yesterday, I remember entering the rehearsal room at Wauconda High School on November 4, 2012.  Anxious about my seating for that year\\'s ILMEA (Illinois Music Educators Association) regional symphonic band, I felt a lump in my throat.  Still sensing the past year\\'s disappointment, my band director accompanied me.  Scanning the neatly arranged, sweeping concentric arcs of black plastic chairs, focusing on where we knew the clarinetists would sit, we searched for my name.  With a sigh of relief, I saw the sheet of white paper with my name typed in bold black letters taped to the first seat in the first row.  Mr. Gordon turned to me and smiled.  I was the principal clarinetist. Just moments earlier I had not known what to expect.  The previous year, even though I was the principal clarinetist at my school, I had not been selected for the honor band.  Obviously, I was disappointed.  I also felt cheated.  I even made excuses.  My pre-audition warmup session had been assigned to the school gym, where cinderblock walls created more of an echo chamber than a proper setting for tuning an instrument.  Maybe my student model, plastic clarinet was not good enough to produce high quality music.  Perhaps I needed a new reed.  Maybe I was just a bit too nervous.  But what would Pasteur think?  As a bench scientist, he would have advised me to observe more objectively and perform experiments to determine what went wrong.  I should prepare more thoroughly. During the ensuing year, I was determined to avoid another disappointment.  Forgetting all of the excuses, I thought about what to do differently.  I wanted to know more about my instrument.  Concerned that my reed had softened, I experimented with using various other reeds and settled on a thicker, stiffer style.  I also modified my practice habits, focusing more of my time on passages in the upper register.  That helped strengthen my embouchure.  Unexpectedly, my stronger embouchure let me experiment with playing extremely softly.  I felt more in control of my playing.  Then, without realizing it, I soon found myself practicing without my sheet music.  Closing my eyes seemed to open my ears.  No longer needing written notes in front of me, I could practice anywhere.  At all sorts of places, I regularly found myself silently fingering the music in thin air.  Then, sometime in the midst of that year, I began to appreciate the difference between simply playing notes and truly making music.  As the next ILMEA audition day approached, I felt confident.  So, what would Einstein say?  As a theoretical physicist he might have advised me to reopen my eyes to observe the world around me - to let my surroundings serve as my laboratory.  I should look beyond specific goals and think creatively. I expect that life will be peppered with setbacks and disappointments, both large and small.  Although missing one year of performing in the honor band seems almost trivial, that experience of my first meaningful disappointment proved invaluable.  In retrospect, my year spent preparing for the next audition yielded far more than the principal seat in the symphonic band.  Unknowingly, I began to understand some of what Pasteur and Einstein were talking about.  Preparation provides opportunity for inspiration.  Realizing how I came to sit in the first seat in the first row has been far more important than the event itself.  Looking forward, I aspire to always prepare to be inspired.\"}, {\"index\": 310, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 311, \"new_personal_statement\": \"When I was growing up, my dad always found a new \\'passion of the day\\'. After I came home from school, he would tell me about some article he had read or podcast he had listened to. Sometimes, I was annoyed by his constant stream of seemingly random information, but as I grew older, I realized that I was becoming more interested in the things he was talking about. Whether waxing on political issues, the newest Apple presentation, or the intense double overtime during the Longhorns game, he always has a fire in his eyes that reveals his joy for learning new things. This thirst for knowledge has rubbed off on me, leading me to join a wide array of activities and to explore a diversity of interests through my course selections. When I started junior year at my new school, I joined Model United Nations, unsure of exactly what the club entailed, but excited for the opportunity to develop a more global perspective. In Model United Nations, I delved deep into research of esoteric topics, such as the French reactions to Mongol invasions in the 15th century, the topic of my first conference. In every area of my life, I am always looking for ways to learn more. The passion for knowledge I gained from my dad was funneled into the freedom of expression I learned from my mother. Both my mom and I could be categorized as chatterboxes, or more kindly, conversationalists. In our family, there were never boundaries of what was and was not appropriate to discuss. I always felt that I could share with my mom more than I could with even my closest friends. She encouraged me to follow my passions and challenge myself to the limits of my abilities. The sense of independence instilled in me from a very young age led me to become the confident speaker I am today. I enjoy sharing my opinion and listening to the opinions of others in formal and informal settings.Although I was free to pursue my own interests, I always looked up to my older sister, Amy, and tended to pick up her hobbies like hand-me-down clothing. Only two years older than me, she could easily relate to my experiences and guide me through whatever emotional difficulty I was dealing with. Amy always found little ways to brighten my day, be it a coloring page she sent me in the mail, an unsolicited hug, or a note she left on my desk. Her small acts of kindness and consistent support inspired me to take on the role of senior mentor within the residence hall at TAMS, my current school. As a senior mentor, I live with a wing of junior girls. Every night, I check them in at curfew and talk them through the challenges of their days. I leave inspirational notes on their doors and make them waffles when they are hungry. As I enjoy my role as senior mentor and prepare for my next phase of life, I hope to emulate my sister\\'s beacon of support.Together, the gifts of intellectual curiosity, freedom of expression, and a strong support system from each member of my family provided a strong foundation for the activities I pursue today.\"}, {\"index\": 312, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'I am the result of a genetic mutation.

I found inspiration and clarity, unlocking a superpower previously unknown \\\\u2013 the courage to be me.By being me, I change the status quo. I played on my school soccer team despite some saying I\\'d never be able to. Though I sometimes struggled to see the ball, I held my own through every victory, loss, practice and fall. Because of this power, I ride my nine-foot tandem mountain bike alongside my coach up hills, through dirt trails and around bends, brimming with pride. I\\'m the first visually impaired cyclist in my interscholastic league\\'s history. My power strengthens my community.I draw on my power to help others in several ways. I work at soup kitchens and food banks, caring for the needy as I provide them with meals and motivation to brighten their days. I coach my peers through algebra and calculus problems to help boost their confidence. My power is infectious.As I prepare for the next chapter of my life, I can\\'t help but remember the blue X-Men lunchbox from elementary school. That marked the day I took charge of my albinism and accepted myself. However, I know my work is far from done because there are others out there who struggle daily to overcome their insecurities. In college, I want to foster wider acceptance for those living with albinism, whether through research, advocacy or a simple conversation. I guess I\\'m not so different from the X-Men; we both fight for acceptance and peace, so others like us can coexist.But I\\'m no superhero.

I wanted to hear her unique story because her experience mattered to me. This is why I came to Germany\\\\u2013 to see the faces behind the generalizations.Three months earlier, as I first proposed a self-designed trip to Germany, I never would have guessed the adventure I would experience. As someone who has always thought of myself as a math/science person, I was inexperienced in seeing the world in anything but absolutes. So when the media kept giving me conflicting absolutes about the European Migrant Crisis\\\\u2013 either that refugees were being supported or that they were being demonized\\\\u2013 I knew that something was amiss. Given the spotlight this election cycle sheds on a whole different variety of migrants coming north into the US, I knew that this was a problem I needed to investigate.I recruited my friend who speaks German along with my friend who makes films and laid out the plan: millions of refugees, fourteen days, five cities, all in one documentary. After arduous (yet exciting) months of calling up refugee camps, sending dozens of emails, and fighting for a grant (which we won), we waved goodbye to our classmates and made our way towards the other side of the globe. Once I arrived, I was astounded at how much people wanted to share their stories of pain and suffering. No longer was this a matter of numbers\\\\u2013 how many people moving this way or that. Instead, I was hearing the human perspective. I felt horrible that so many people were being denied opportunities simply because of what country they happened to be born in. I couldn\\'t stand that some Germans were stereotyping refugees based on a few news stories that portray them in a bad light.Like us, Germans simply want what is best for their family and what is best for their community. But when those conflict, the outcomes vary drastically. On the one hand, people can get very defensive of their communities. My tears started forming as I saw the literal ashes of the home built for refugees in Bautzen, with the neo-Nazi party\\'s flag planted in the rubble. But I also saw communities truly coming together to give their food, their knowledge, and their time to support the refugees\\\\u2013 and this is where I found hope. One migrant I interviewed who walked through twelve countries to get to Hamburg, Mustafa, has certainly not been propelled by his empty stomach or crumbling shoes on his feet. Instead, because he knows that he and his family could be safe from being drafted into the war, from being thrown in prison for their religion, from being blown to smithereens in the middle of the night, he is driven to search for a new life in Germany.I will forever carry with me the people who, despite having been through horrific life changing experiences, just wanted to be seen as regular people.Since returning home, I have worked closely with the Partnership for the Advancement of New Americans and YALLA San Diego to raise awareness back in my local community. The documentary is not only sharing my learning about migrants in Europe, but I am gathering the whole of San Diego together behind this incredible cause. I know that sharing stories of those who saw beyond the stereotype of refugees in Germany and decided to help can motivate Southern Californians to do the same.When I speak in front of thousands on World Migrant Day in December, I will tell of my experience in Europe not solely for the impactful specifics, but also so I can inspire others to go out into the community and try to help a group that is just as human as everyone else: migrants.\"}, {\"index\": 315, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 316, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 317, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Like reading the first few pages of a new book, walking into my apartment in the United States for the first time at eight years old felt disorienting. Little did I know, I would continue to feel perplexed and out of place for the next nine years. This displacement presented itself in many forms: my self-identity, how others perceived me, and the way I was expected to behave.As an immigrant, choosing to abide by traditional values seemed like a crime, so unconsciously, my survival instinct led me to conform. Wearing my hijab, which my religion taught me to be a woman\\'s crown, became radical. However, lowering that scarf five inches down to my neck made me stylish. My thick curly hair cascading down the sides of my face in tight ringlets was thought to be unruly, so I permanently straightened it. Skin color became a cultural divider and drew a thin line between respect and ridicule, so I invested in face creams containing hydroquinone, a skin bleach, in hopes of finally looking \\'American.\\'Much of my life was spent navigating between the different worlds I inhabit: the life of an immigrant Muslim girl, and the life of an American high schooler. Not everyone in my family straddled these worlds successfully. During the spring of my sophomore year, I lost my cousin to an overdose. His uncertainty with his identity led him to make poor decisions that resulted in his death. This pivotal moment forced me to mature and prompted me to start thinking of my identity and its purpose. I still felt the pressure to conform, but his death made me realize I shouldn\\'t let anything prevent me from doing what I want, from being who I am.That same month, I befriended a college student who was extremely passionate about the Syrian Refugee crisis. I had never been politically involved before then - the only news I followed was that of my Instagram feed and Twitter timeline. She told me stories of her summer teaching English to refugees in Turkey, and I immediately wanted to help. I also saw my involvement as an opportunity to assuage the sadness from my cousin\\'s passing. We made fifty cent bracelets, sold them for 1-2 dollars, and sent all the fundraised money to the families she met. After a few months, friends, classmates, and strangers alike began approaching us about the refugee families living here in New Jersey, so our efforts turned domestic. From there, our nonprofit was formed. I was sixteen years old and didn\\'t expect people to take me seriously, yet a majority of the time I would lead groups of volunteers and host events where the people working under me were in their twenties and thirties. As a result, I understood the kind of impact that could be made and since then our services have expanded to medical relief, rental assistance, food packages, and integration services such as resume building, tutoring, and work fairs. Today, I still have a foot in both worlds and struggle with the pressure to conform. It is only in retrospect that I came to realize this, but once I did I began to appreciate and even share my Egyptian heritage; however, I still embrace my American side. After all, I lived here nearly half my life. Instead, I have bridged the two cultures, accepting that I don\\'t need to fully be one or the other; there are two sides to my coin. I stand unwavering whenever the thought of not belonging creeps my mind. I no longer feel the need to straighten my hair, I have discarded my collection of face creams, and I am proudly donning my headscarf because I am finally starting to understand my place as an Egyptian-American.\"}, {\"index\": 318, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The word \\'environmentalist\\' always evoked images of wilderness adventurers and white hippie chicks, and certainly not me, so it never occurred to me to get involved in sustainability.

Through my four years of doing this same daily routine at Marian Boys School in Tanzania I learned many basic things of life: I learned how important it was to get up at 4am to locate a bucket of water so I could have a shower to start my day; I learned that if I had total recall of all that was written on my teachers\\' blackboard I would do well on my examinations; and I learned in my overcrowded dormitory how to twist and turn my body just right to gain maximum space for sleeping. This was my life before I was selected to join Haven of Peace Academy (HOPAC) two years ago.When I transferred to HOPAC, I realized that the strict structure of Marian Boys\\' had shaped me to become disciplined and self-motivated in my studies. However, it didn\\'t take me long to realize that the Tanzania National curriculum schools, like Marian Boys\\' were completely missing out on another important part of education, that there was a life outside the classroom.I was trained by the National curriculum schools to memorize, memorize, memorize. What was written in the book was the truth and I had to know it, recite it, and write it just the way I read it. I was taught to study so I could answer the all-important examination questions, forgetting that I\\'d have to actually think for myself in the future. The curriculum I encountered when I joined HOPAC completely changed my mindset and opened me up to a broader way of thinking. I learnt I couldn\\'t succeed by cramming notes only but I needed to understand and learn their application in real life. HOPAC helped me recognize that there was more to being a student than academic success; this unique school was about helping me to developing into a whole person.My mindset was completely revolutionized when I first entered HOPAC. I was encouraged to not only join a multiple of sports teams, but the student government, school band, community service, and drama as well. Throughout my time at HOPAC, I was encouraged to discover new passions just as much as my studies. Motivated by the teachers to join the student council, I was both excited and anxious to take on a leadership role and quickly learned to value the opinions of fellow students; gaining respect through new friendships. Through an outreach service to a handicapped work center, I learned a whole new life perspective through the people I worked with. In my first all-school assembly at HOPAC I saw the school band perform and eagerly awaited my opportunity to join them. When I joined them, I quickly joined with my guitar, but soon learned that I had a passion to share my gift of music and offered guitar lessons to others. Even the playing on sports teams at HOPAC has a different emphasis, learning that teamwork, sportsmanship and commitment was just as important as winning.Without taking away from the importance of books and studies in education, I have come to strongly believe that students need a creative mind and a balanced social life to be able to work around the material they receive in class, and this is what is missing in our Tanzanian National Curriculum education system. When I was first selected to receive the full scholarship to study at Haven of Peace Academy, I was obviously filled with excitement, but I didn\\'t truly know what was awaiting me. Confronted with a whole new life-style at HOPAC, I was happy to encounter a change, a change that has helped me to grow into a more prepared person to meet the challenges of today\\'s world.\"}, {\"index\": 320, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 321, \"new_personal_statement\": \"kjIt was a dark and stormy night \\\\u2014 but actually, it was.A new tradition arose a few years ago at our band camp, the Hunger Games (don\\'t worry, there is absolutely nomurder involved); it is an amalgamation of small, seemingly-pointless minute-to-win-it games that pit the differentsections of the band against each other, proving who truly has the most spirit.

There was a perfect spot for the staff of the flag,and in the most meant-to-be way, I stabbed the flag into the top of the scaffolding.

Perfume Bazaar is the last place on earth I would have expected to be diverse; but somehow, it\\'s a cosmopolitan paradise.Any day at the Bazaar, bustling or slow, brings with it a cornucopia of people from vastly different walks of life. As a salesman, I\\'ve handed scent strips to everybody from a Vodou priest to a Chinese business tycoon to an Afghan refugee to a Serbian supermodel. Although I never would have crossed paths with these people in my day-to-day, South Carolinian life, cologne has become my bridge into their lives. These bottles of scented alcohol\\\\u2014the ones I only ever received as gifts from family friends, doomed to collect dust on my dresser\\\\u2014have opened me up to their fondest memories, wildest dreams, and liveliest experiences. Through cologne, I\\'ve vicariously learned about a world around me I never knew to exist.My most memorable customer, however, wasn\\'t a far-fetched, outlandish character. In fact, at first, he appeared fairly unremarkable. A Middle-eastern man about ten years older than me, he had messy black hair, a patchy beard, and olive, horn-rimmed glasses perched atop his nose, and was wearing a loose, black NASA t-shirt on his lanky frame. He walked in as I tended to another customer, inspecting the sea of multicolored boxes lining the shop\\'s walls with attentive, brown eyes while waiting on help.He was in town for his sister\\'s wedding, and was looking for \\'something crisp and citrusy\\' for the occasion. Scents like these were popular during the summertime, so I instinctively grabbed a bottle of Versace Eau Fraiche, a cologne I thought fit his description perfectly.\\'What do you think?\\'\\'Yeah...\\' he responded, nodding his head somewhat hesitantly, \\'It\\'s good, I guess. Any other suggestions?\\'As we went from cologne to cologne, we continued to make small talk. While rummaging through a storage drawer for a bottle of Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue, I commented on his shirt.\\'Wait, so do work at NASA or something?\\'Immediately, we clicked. Turns out that the summer before, he took time off of his astronautical engineering PhD to intern there. He excitedly discussed his work in propulsion systems, and our conversation gravitated toward my own research in galactic evolution. Minutes became hours as we jumped from one topic to another. We bonded over our common passions for programming, hip-hop music, and, to my surprise, South Asian culture\\\\u2014he explained to me the intertwined history of Iran, his home country, and India, launching a conversation on everything from Punjabi and Farsi\\'s striking similarities to Bollywood\\'s acclaim in Iranian society. We ruminated over our deepest problems and our aspirations in life. He wasn\\'t a customer anymore\\\\u2014in that moment, he was my best friend.Two hours later, he settled on Burberry Brit. We bade each other goodbye. As he left, reality hit me hard: there was a good chance he had left my life forever.

I didn\\'t even have a name\\\\u2014just a mishmash of his looks, our talk, and warm feelings to remember him by.I spent the next few days thinking about him nonstop. Time went on, though, and so did life at the Bazaar. Since then, I\\'ve continued to meet diverse, fascinating customers, but my exchanges with them have transformed significantly. Before, I passively absorbed whatever they had to say about their lives. Now, I actively try to connect with each one, searching for the story within them.Thanks to my Iranian NASA intern, I ultimately realized that life, in general, is like working at a cologne shop: a lot of amazing people are going to filter in and out of it, so cherish every conversation, every interaction you have while you can. Everybody has a story to share.\"}, {\"index\": 323, \"new_personal_statement\": \" Growing up as a child often included frightening experiences. I remember that when I was five years old, my two sisters and I were sent to live with our grandparents in China. We hadn\\'t been told what was happening, and I thought our parents were coming with us on the plane. I thought wrong. When I realized this, I cried, but there was nothing I could do about it. While in China, we went to a medical facility weekly to receive shots. It was especially terrifying for my two year old sister; she had to take the injections to her head, causing her to panic whenever a doctor approached. Those experiences proved to be the worst part. After I returned to the US, I started going to school. After school, my mom took me to the restaurant my parents ran. For years, I spent every weekday at the restaurant until closing time. This helped ignite my passion for reading. With little to do, I began borrowing books from the school library and reading the time away. While sitting behind a restaurant counter, I saw so many different things in my mind\\'s eye. There was Sam in My Side of the Mountain, who ran away to live alone in a forest. It\\'s something that I always wanted to do as a kid, and I managed to live that experience through Sam. The detailed descriptions let me imagine his circumstances. There was also The Edge Chronicles, a fantasy series that enthralled me with its maps, plethora of protagonists, and riveting descriptions. My love for reading eventually grew to encompass not only fictional stories, but history and classic mythology as well.  Unfortunately, reading occupied me far too much. As a child, I was always very introverted and reticent. I didn\\'t make many friends, and had only one very close friend. My social skills suffered. I was even afraid to order food on my own. In restaurants, I would stutter when asked what I wanted to order. Project presentations were the death of me; my nervousness mounted until all I could feel was the pounding of my heart and the sweat on my palms. Somehow, I didn\\'t see it as a real issue back then. Around the beginning of my teenage years, I began protesting internally to my father\\'s full authority at home. I thought: \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Why does he have all the power when my mother works harder? Just because he\\'s a man? My mother is the person doing everything; driving us to school, doing housework, buying necessities, and taking charge at the restaurant. My father treats his position like he\\'s privileged royalty; he lazes about, sleeping as my mother drives to the grocery store and watching TV as she cooks and cleans.\\' He used to get drunk every night, until my mother finally worked up the courage to ask him to stop this summer. It was a relief. He used to frequently wake me up at night to ramble while inebriated.  Every time I build up enough confidence to explain what I believe is wrong with the situation to my father, he knocks it all down. I can never appear as an equal in his eyes. He has a short temper, and telling him a truth he refused to believe was one of the most successful ways to trigger it. He\\'s right, I\\'m wrong, and that\\'s the end of it. Though I learned that I wouldn\\'t be trapped in the injustice forever, I still failed to retain much confidence. It was extremely difficult to feel any self-assurance in an environment like my home, and this only added to my already poor social skills.  My self-esteem remains low, but I\\'ve been working to improve it. During my high school years, I realized at last how important it was to be outgoing, how the ability to clearly convey thoughts was so crucial. My best friend of eleven years used to be around to help when I was anxious about talking to someone, whether it was a stranger, teacher, or cashier. Ever since she moved away at the end of sophomore year, nerve-wracking conversations were a challenge for me to shoulder alone. Though I miss her, our parting acted as a wakeup call. It gave me a push that forced me to stand up on my own.  I\\'m still awkward and nervous when speaking sometimes, but I\\'ve improved. Even though my poor social skills have always followed me, they don\\'t have to be there for my entire life. I\\'m no longer as afraid to talk. I must still work on my relatively incomprehensible way of speaking, since I\\'m often told that I speak too quickly and too quietly. However, I know that I can overcome this, my toughest obstacle, and take control of my own life.\"}, {\"index\": 324, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I was disappointed when I learned the meaning of my Chinese name.

I\\'ve experienced it often while collaborating with my robotics team, and in the hours I\\'ve spent with my father on design concepts for his prefabricated homes. Still, nothing I had worked on before was similar to the feeling this \\'out of the box\\' idea had triggered.Growing strawberries in a high school locker seemed fairly simple at first.

Many students and teachers became interested in my project, yet were skeptical of my botanical prowess and quick to conclude that a plant could not possibly receive its basic necessities in a locker, which didn\\'t have proper ventilation, was hot and humid, and was shielded from both sunlight and any source of water. Still, I was determined to make this work. The unfriendly habitat and logistical obstacles did not deter me.My horticultural roots stem from my mother and elementary level biology. It wasn\\'t until this year that my knowledge expanded beyond this casual level into a realm where biology, chemistry, and physics found beautiful, synergistic intersections. I was determined to apply what I had learned and got to work.Due to the lack of electricity and direct sunlight, I decided to use a solar panel paired with a light sensor on the outside of my locker to power a strong, blue LED light, which is best for photosynthesis and plant growth. A friend taught me how to solder and helped me create the solar panel setup, which turns on the blue light only when it is dark outside so the plants experience the proper light cycles. I also set up a system to slowly water the plants automatically. This involved a series of drip bottles\\\\u2013which another friend had for his old, now deceased, pet guinea pig\\\\u2013arranged to drip into each other and then onto the soil.Having addressed the issues of light and water, I focused on the need to circulate air. Leaving the door closed would provide essentially no circulation and would create a hot and moist environment, making the plants more susceptible to mold. After experimenting with various designs and a 3D printed prototype, I came up with an extension of the latching mechanism on the inside of my locker, which I called the \\'strawberry jamb.\\' The jamb, which I cut using our school\\'s CNC router, sufficiently boosts airflow by allowing the door to remain ajar about two inches while still maintaining the integrity of the existing locking mechanism. I made a beautiful wooden box, emblazoned with the laser-cut engraving \\'Strawberry Fields Forever\\' and provided proper drainage onto a tray inside the locker to avoid water damage to school property. The strawberry plants are now growing in my partially open locker providing a topic of conversation and much commentary from students walking by.What began as a seemingly improbable idea fed my passion for creative thinking and mechanical engineering. This project not only allowed me to practically apply isolated academic principles I had studied, but it also pushed me to traverse multiple disciplines to creatively solve problems. Furthermore, it\\'s uniqueness beckoned for community input and collaboration, allowing me to access resources to achieve fiscally responsible solutions and ultimate success. For me, it was invigorating to propel a project that many deemed impossible into the realm of possible. I intend to continue to explore and invent because only then are new realities possible.\"}, {\"index\": 327, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I distinctly remember my little heart pounding in ambitious excitement, listening intently to the teacher\\'s request forus to write down our dreams as I was being handed a small slip of paper. As I scribbled ferociously, I knew I didnot want to tread water in the ocean of hopeful lawyers or doctors. I wanted to sail down the little stream filled withdreams of playing basketball in the WNBA.When I started high school, my aspirations were within reach. In grade nine, I was already a starter on the varsitygirls\\' basketball team and had been invited to the provincial team tryouts that same year. I was sailing on clearwaters, and I was confident that nothing could stop me from seizing my dream.Then, unexpectedly, the tides picked up, and everything changed.First came the injuries. I would never forget the sharp, intense pain in my right ankle as if it had been pierced witha blade. I remember the embittered tears that could not stop flowing down my stubborn cheeks. My indignantwrath for myself pushed me to put in extra training time. Unfortunately, this did not yield the results I was lookingfor. My injuries only worsened. This happened so many times that I soon lost count. Each time, I would get morefrustrated with myself because I knew I was watching the little boat I had built slowing falling apart.The sobering realization that I might not make it into the WNBA reigned in my head. I realized I needed a break, athought that used to be unthinkable because of my unrelenting laser-sharp focus on achieving my ultimate dream.But now, I realized that that dream was changing shape.After taking a month away from the sport, I discovered that basketball had been such an integral part of my lifethat when I no longer had to stay at school until 6pm for practice, I felt like a piece of me was lost. I was surprisedto find that even though I knew my original goal was out of reach, my thirst to play basketball was stillunquenchable.Sometimes, you don\\'t realize how important something is until it is taken away from you. This was how I felt. WhatI realized when basketball was taken out of my life, because I thought I had given up on my original goal ofbecoming a WNBA player, was that I could never give it up. What I hungered for was the game, not the goal.So when I did return to the court, I returned with a change of heart. I played not with the desire to be the best, butwith the passion and joys of savouring each and every moment doing the one thing that I loved. Looking back, Iwas blessed to experience the indescribable highs of winning championships and the inconceivable lows of losingin the finals during overtime. I was blessed to wake up everyday to challenge myself physically and emotionally.More importantly, over the last six years of basketball, I got to share all those unforgettable memories filled withlaughter with the people I now call family.When I first began sailing down the little stream, I had only wanted to get to the other side. But as I journeyed on, Ifell in love with the flowers on the riverbank and the little fish swimming underneath. I even looked forward tomaneuvering around the boulders and tides that got in the way. Soon, I realized there was no end to the stream.And although I started my journey fixated on a dream, along the way, I had found something better \\\\u2013 a passionthat would be part of my life forever.\"}, {\"index\": 328, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Like little flashlights flickering in the humid summer air, the fireflies light my way. They buzz and snap, illuminating the darkening sky and the tree lined pavement as I walk through my neighborhood. This is my favorite part of the day: the transition between light and dark. The fireflies emerge, and the fact that such a small creature can produce chemical reactions that generate light truly fascinates me. These walks, the fireflies and what I learn through my observations of nature represent the unknown. Maybe that is why I am so interested in entomology and maintaining a curiosity to explore the world around me.In middle school, I developed an interest in entomology that surprised both my family and me. I fell in love with the lacey wings of treehoppers, the frothy cocoons of spittlebugs, and the strange habits of 13 and 17-year periodic cicadas. The world filled with six legged creatures, new scientific vocabulary, and something called entomophagy, the consumption of insects as food, enchanted me. This curiosity propelled me to not only study their characteristics, and categorize their unique traits, but to also start tasting ants, grasshoppers, mole crickets, silkworms, mealworms, and sago worms. Not every flavor is perfect when tasting different kinds of insects. Many are strange and discomfiting, but by trying them, I am able to better understand what I do like. Entomophagy shows me the benefits of going outside of my comfort zone in a fun way and encourages me to take risks and be adventurous. Similarly, in my pathway in technology, by attending behind the scenes events and workshops at technology companies, I was able to explore all sorts of different facets of technology: financial technology, web design, social media strategy, business to business solutions. When my teacher introduced me and my friend to Women in Technology, an organization in Atlanta developed to help girls succeed in technology from the classroom to the boardroom, I jumped into their events with enthusiasm and learned as much as I could about women in technology, attending events and a job shadow week at corporations around Atlanta like the Weather Company, Firstdata, and Ernst & Young. What had initially begun as a simple desire to learn more about programming turned into a passion to get to see the inner workings of businesses, nonprofits and organizations and how automation and technology was streamlining how they worked, compounded with the evolving role of women in technology.Just as how the darkness of twilight serves to illuminate fireflies, transforms them from clumsy little floating beetles into ethereal glowing \\'fireflies\\' and demonstrates their unique bioluminescence, Women in Technology served as my illuminator in finding the careers in technology I was interested in, developing my confidence, and what it meant to be \\'a girl in STEM\\'. In the daytime, I thought I was clumsy and ill-suited for tech simply because of coding, but in reality, my soft skills and other abilities were illuminated by WIT. As a student leader, I worked with my friends to help other girls in my school to join WIT events and discovered a passion for STEM. My interests in understanding technology, science, business and how the world works are ultimately what drive me. Just like how entomophagy and trying out insects propelled me to open my palate to new foods and discover new passions, Women In Technology opened my mind to what technology means and how a group of passionate people can come together to make a tremendous impact. Isn\\'t there that saying that \\'we are what we eat\\'? I hope then that I am as adventurous in my passions and curiosities as I am in eating insects, and I continue to be willing to take risks, to find joy in uncommon places, to make the world a better place, and never to stop being curious. As a national student representative for the Anti-Defamation League, opening conversations in my school surrounding sensitive topics is very important to me. Attending the national youth leadership mission last year in Washington D.C. provided me an opportunity to understand the value in meaningful conversations.At North Springs, I was thrown into a diverse high school plagued by division. Half of the school population is African-American, many coming from the south side of Atlanta for the dual magnet program, and the majority of them are on free reduced lunch. Additionally, a large portion of the remaining students come from private, Jewish middle schools. Thus, the student population represents a wide range of religious, political and socio-economic backgrounds that holds varied perspectives on police brutality, LGBTQ issues, and privilege. I worked on my school\\'s ADL student advisory council to create and implement a curriculum for freshmen. With a discussion activity designed to show students what they shared in common, we sought to create a space where students could develop relationships with other freshmen with whom they might not have had a chance to interact. We wanted this activity to improve the spirit of and community within our school. We need to bring groups together constantly in my school, and we are really trying to bridge the divides with this new activity.Personally, I tried to bridge the divide by developing friendships with people of all backgrounds and would bring these talking points home. At the dinner table, I explored how people of different backgrounds needed to listen to each other and maintain a conversational dialogue. In this way, I have influenced my parents simply by bringing another perspective to the family table. With my ADL involvement, my father even attended a community civic dinner this past summer with me. Attending a heavily minority, progressive school has helped me to have deeper conversations with my parents and to open their perspectives on American life. The need for more cross-cultural interaction and conversation is extremely important, and my experience with the ADL motivates me to push for more conversations like this in my community.Sago worms, bacon and sour cream flavored crickets, ants, and roasted mealworms are some of the insects that I\\'ve tasted in my free time. There is something unnerving but also so exciting about extending so far beyond my comfort zone. I tried insects for the first time when I was studying entomology for a Science Olympiad competition. After that first taste of mealworms and crickets, my willingness to explore more exotic protein options has grown and has made me passionate about exploring the unknown and to have fun while doing it. What\\'s next on my list? Earthworm jerkyAtlanta\\'s Women in Technology organization has meant so much to me in terms of how it has empowered me and transformed me as I look to my future study and professional career.In participating in WIT\\'s events, I strengthened my understanding of how technology is changing society and how businesses function. I shadowed and interacted with professional women in technology and found an amazing mentor, Ms. Carrisa. Initially, I connected with her when I was hosting a WIT career panel at my school. She loves telling the story of how she came on campus thinking I was part of the faculty based on how I had communicated with her through email. She ended up becoming an encouraging mentor and provides me with incredible guidance.I am motivated to use my experience at WIT to help other girls like me who might not be sure about their interests in STEM. WIT offered a model for me to bring women together in science and technology, and in following its lead, I started by providing a ride to girls who didn\\'t have transportation to WIT events. Later, I organized summer STEM program, hosted a career panel at my school, and collaborated with the work-based learning teacher to leverage platforms like LinkedIn to connect WBL students with the marketplace.My dream is to become a highly successful businesswoman in technology and to pave the for more girls and women in tech fields to thrive just as WIT has done for me.\"}, {\"index\": 329, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 330, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 331, \"new_personal_statement\": \"  Once I started high school, I was finally allowed to start wearing makeup. Though this is a pretty commonplace rite of passage, it was my first personal encounter with the injustice that people of color face. My mom and I walked into our local Target, and I was absolutely ecstatic to complete what I thought was such a womanly task. I quickly fell from cloud nine as I looked at the shades of the different products on the makeup shelves and realized there were none that matched my brown skin. At age thirteen, I definitely could not afford to spend my back to school shopping money on the more-costly high-end makeup that drugstore companies lack of variety forced me to buy, but it was my only option.   Since then, drugstore makeup brands have definitely expanded their color palettes to include some darker skin tones. However, I tend to be one of the darkest shades offered, and there are many women far darker than I am. Buying and wearing makeup is in no way a necessity, but it is also not the type of experience that should instill self-loathing in those whose skin isn\\'t \\'honey beige\\' or \\'classic ivory.\\' This is only the beginning of the injustice that women of color face their entire lives, and it only gets worse from here.  As I enter my senior year of high school, I find myself getting just as excited about walking the cosmetics aisles in Target as I did three years ago, so much in fact that I do it far moreoften than my parents or my wallet would like. However, I know many girls my age, who are just as interested in \\'beating their face\\' as I am, don\\'t have the luxury of finding cheaper, drugstore makeup in a color suited for them. Not being able to buy products that are otherwise perfectbecause they are not manufactured for your skin tone instills a saddening sense of defeat. It is one of the subtlest ways that society seems to condemn darker-skinned women to a life below that of our fairer-skinned counterparts. I wish to change this seemingly simple injustice because I know about the vicious cycle it creates for so many young women and girls.  I am not quite sure how makeup is formulated or why it is seemingly so much more difficult to create darker shades of foundations and concealers, and right now, mixing various chemicals and pigments is not of my skill subset. I may not be able to solve this problem by myself, but there is someone out there who knows how to formulate makeup at low-cost in the unique combinations needed to replicate various skin tones. Why not work with someone like that to help alleviate the self-loathing that subtly racist cosmetic companies instill in so many women and girls? Why haven\\'t large, drugstore makeup companies not done this yet?  Obviously, there are far worse issues that many people here in the United States and around the world face based solely upon their skin color \\\\u2013wage disparities and microaggressive remarks to name a couple. It would truly be ridiculous of me to suggest that extending the selection of makeup to include women (and men) of color would somehow solve the ancient problem that is racism. However, for those of us who\\'ve experienced racism, even in its most minute and subtle forms, any kind of change would be amazing. To walk down the cosmetic aisles at Target and see other women of color enjoying inexpensive makeup would be a step in the right direction towards creating a society where skin color is just skin color and people are just people and opportunities are available for everyone.\"}, {\"index\": 332, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Egg yolks, olive oil, yogurt and a tablespoon of honey. Light filtered in through the kitchen curtains, skeining my hands silver as I stirred these ingredients together, humming along to the rhythm of my whisk looping around the bowl. Water from my freshly washed hair dripped onto the linoleum tiles, punctuating the quietness of the early morning. Such a moment of peace, unfortunately, did not last long. When mixed thoroughly, the concoction shimmered a rich translucent gold. This was my grandmother\\'s hair treatment recipe, which she insisted was integral to maintaining her sleek dark locks. Although the idea of smearing yellowish slime all over my head sounded suspect, I ultimately decided to try out her recipe after much agonizing. In my early teenage years, my desire for healthy hair had been paramount. I dipped both palms into the cool consistency before combing the sticky mixture over my scalp, massaging it briskly through the damp strands. After a few minutes of waiting, I rested my elbows on the blue Formica countertop and turned on the hot water in the sink to rinse off the mask. The warmth felt incredibly good pouring down my head. Pale steam drifted upwards in thin plumes, its scent pervading the winter air. It was a delicious aroma that, I realized with a growing horror as I prodded a solidifying wad of sizzling something in my hair, smelled suspiciously like scrambled eggs. Releasing an unearthly screech, I skidded across the floor and bolted upstairs to the nearest bathroom mirror. I was mortified! My cat took one look at me and fled with his tail fluffed in the air, hissing, while my sister cackled and lunged for the camera. I wailed again when I saw the yellowish mass stubbornly clinging to my ten inches of long black hair and clawed at it frantically. \\'What am I going to do?\\' It was surreal\\\\u2014I had cooked an egg in my hair. Two snapped combs, multiple Google searches (\\'how to get cooked egg out of hair,\\' and later \\'how to get broken comb out of hair\\'), and lots of tearful scraping later, I eventually succeeded in removing most of the egginess with a metal fork. Because of incidents like this, I have come to appreciate and even welcome the mishaps that occur when I try out new activities. My initial batch of tomato plants was massacred when I left them under the wrath of a full summer sun. In my kitchen, I mistake salt for sugar, vinegar for soy sauce, flour for baking powder. Most people stress and fret over making such mistakes, and often grow discouraged or give up altogether. But for me, messing up is the most effective and memorable way to learn what not to do, and brings me one step closer to doing things correctly. Knowing this propels me to persevere and try again. I am in a constant state of beginning. Even as I progress into adulthood, I will always be in the midst of another unfamiliarity, whether it be writing contemporary magic realism or conducting a principal component analysis with MATLAB. When my grandmother heard about my unfortunate \\'egg-cident,\\' as my sister later termed it, she wheezed with laughter over the phone: \\'You had to rinse your hair with cold water!\\' Even I had to concede that the moment was hilarious in hindsight. Setbacks will inevitably happen, and sometimes I will fail and fall. But unlike that egg stuck in my hair, I always try to land sunny-side up.\"}, {\"index\": 333, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 334, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time.I always wondered what it was like on the East Coast, how their metropolitan lifestyle differed from our Californian way of life.

After a general biology course at my local community college, to gain further insight specifically on biomedical studies and life as a medical student, I attended a UCI summer pre-med program. I got to diagnose a newly treated patient and work with a team of students, learn from physician guest speakers with live teleconference surgeries, and use robotic and laparoscopic surgery equipment among many other activities. These programs taught me essential laboratory and research skills, from micro-pipetting to separating DNA with gel electrophoresis, from suturing to intubation, from clinical case studies to team research projects, which all contributed to my growing academic passion.For me science is not just a favorite subject, it is a career path, a potential tool for public service, and above all, it is a way of viewing life. Research has taught me a different perspective, a unique academic attitude that requires constant questioning and experimentation. The hands-on laboratory skills I have grown accustomed to will be of tremendous help and influence on my future journey. With every new droplet of knowledge obtained, I will enhance my academic and career repertoire, which will expand and grow for as long as my faucet flows.\"}, {\"index\": 335, \"new_personal_statement\": \"On Nov. 11th, Singles\\' Day in China, I was crouching in the bedroom corner without a companion, other than adim lamp. As a modern lady, I should be independent, mentally muscular, and physically adaptable. Yet, beingsingle was still undesirable, and I could not resist the painful impulse to fill my mouth with sweet chocolatecookies, as if calories were the only source of comfort. So I visited Taobao, China\\'s largest online shoppingplatform remembering to distribute generous discounts for singles on the day. My cookies were on sale, but stillpriced high. I sighed. But just before I gave up on the high-calorie rescue, I noticed a line under the price tag,saying, \\'Taobao allows gradual payment without interest for thirty days.\\' How loving it was! I therefore finishedordering the items with the online loan and had a sweet cookie dream.Growing up with Internet finance, I cannot help relying on Internet finance services and pursuing the fascinatingbusiness theories and products. However, according to my subsequent research project on mobile healthcareapplications with a university professor, theories and products were insufficient for a business to thrive, whileknowing and meeting customers\\' needs were crucial.I was amazed by the fierce market competitions in the healthcare apps industry, because thousands of apps allperformed similar functions: tracking patients\\' data, advising on diet and exercise, and enhancing patient-doctorcommunication. The professor in my course posed this inspiring question: \\'If you are a CEO, what can you do tomake your apps stand out?\\' To find out the answer, I consulted books, discussed in the Beijing EntrepreneurshipSaloon, and I even stood in front of a mirror, visualizing myself as a buyer. I would buy a healthcare app for mygrandma, who was constantly bothered by diabetes. Since she had little experiences with a smart phone, appdevelopers should not expect her to understand intricate page designs or to follow complex instructions. Thereports generated also needed to be as explicit as possible.Definitely business people put their heart into advancing technologies, designing chic products, and studying thebalance between costs and profits, but are they being careful enough on positioning customer\\'s requirements? Inthis case specifically, I, as a customer, define successful products by downloading apps, and spreading eithercompliments or complaints online.Luckily, I had the opportunity to comprehend customers and markets in a real setting by interning with a BeijingInternet finance company.\\'Would you like to learn about our financial products with up to nine-percent annual revenue?\\' In the workplace, Irepeated this sentence to potential customers. Meanwhile, I diligently handed people flyers and advertised ourtrustworthy lending-borrowing cycle to those who were willing to stop by the counter. Retired couples wanted theirsavings and pensions to gain value; nine-to-five employees hitchhiked in the developing trend of Internet finance,avoiding the risk in stock and real estate markets; aspirant entrepreneurs needed start-up funds to realize theirdreams of becoming \\'the next Steve Jobs\\'. Gradually, when I invited people to sit at the table, I involuntarily putflyers aside because I was prepared to hear them talk. What they were experiencing and needing were importantto me, from not only the aspect of making deals, but also the spirit of \\'customers first.\\'The destination of products is the market.

I worked hard to diminish my accent, for a sense of belonging, of home.I remember countless conversations in which the discrepancy between my appearance and my languages came up. Not again reverberating in my brain. I wondered why these \\'opposites\\' had to define me so much, yet they have become my bridge to the outside world. They have forced me to be unequivocally myself, not allowing me to fade into the background.Clich\\\\u00e9d as our introduction was, it leads to an interesting conversation. Talk of origins always does.I remember coming to Costa Rica with my words as my luggage. They reminded me of past homes and helped me settle into my new one. Learning languages was as natural as breathing\\\\u2026 and just as unconscious. Every new day in Costa Rica was like Christmas, gifting me a new word in Spanish to be unwrapped and chewed on, like candy.Yet with each new word I mastered in Spanish, I lost its equivalent in German, my mother tongue, as well as my ties to my mother and maternal grandmother. I lost the lullabies they sang to me as I was falling asleep; I lost their wagging fingers as they scolded me in German. This sense of loss was my turning point with languages. I took control of my identity by mastering German, by reconquering this haunting language, harsh yet sweet.I jump out of the Uber, guitar in tow. I look around anxiously for Gerti, my German tutor. She\\'s a kindred spirit: existentialist, restless, in tune with nature. One summer, she hauled me along to Austria to work on my German, affectionately calling me her surrogate daughter. I walk around aimlessly, looking obviously foreign. Gerti rushes towards me, holding our theater tickets, and tells me that I really ought to dye my hair. \\'In order to gain something, you must sacrifice something,\\' she pontificates. Yet I would never hide my hair. It reminds me of who I am: as much a part of Colorado as of Bavaria and Costa Rica. And I know that not all things work on a bartering basis. After all, I did manage to speak Spanish and keep my German.We chatter in German, in our own secret universe, excited to attend the biannual International Poetry Festival.

I realize that everything said here will be premeditated, weighted, and meaningful.As Gerti and I are ushered into the theater, the poets\\' voices strain against the boundaries of language as they read their poems in their native languages. They weave their stories; their emotion makes their voices deeper with meaning. I endeavor to understand them beyond their words, sounds that I do not understand, yet I feel their joy, their desolation, their yearning.This has been my life\\'s struggle: reaching to find the words that express who I am. Whenever I speak in English, the impish and carefree parts of my personality come out; Spanish brings out my long-windedness, while German has my more idealistic and intellectual side. They all twine together inside of me.Acquiring Spanish allowed me to explore my more vibrant facets. Losing German unmasked my strength and determination to recover parts of myself. I fought for a tico accent and the German language in order to appropriate them, in spite of and because of my strawberry blonde hair and blue eyes.\"}, {\"index\": 340, \"new_personal_statement\": \"It was always a dream of mine to perform in a musical. After I saw my first Broadway production, Hairspray, I knew I just had to perform on stage one day. I bought countless soundtracks, my favorite being Les Miserables. I would sit in my room listening to all thirty-one songs performed by the original London cast over and over. I decided I would someday be Eponine, and soon I knew every word to every song. Phrases such as \\'a little fall of rain\\' and \\'I am agog\\' became part of my daily vocabulary. At this time I was also taking piano lessons. One day my teacher asked me to match pitch with notes that she played. Hearing me hum the note, my teacher informed me that I was tone deaf, and my dream of Broadway stardom was crushed in one fell swoop. Frustrated, I sang \\'Do you hear the people sing\\' to her not only to show her I could sing but because that song very accurately portrayed my feelings at that moment (it is the song of angry men after all). She smiled but told me to stick to the piano. Eventually, I found that the clarinet was a better instrument for me. I played mainly classical music for solo performances and pop music in marching band. I participated in community bands where I played with accountants, home improvement contractors and pumpkin farmers that were fifty years older than me. I played in all-county bands with some of the most talented musicians on Long Island. However, something was missing, but I wasn\\'t sure what it was. One day last year my band teacher stopped me in the hall and asked if I would like to play in the pit orchestra for the school production of The Addams Family. I was ecstatic, even though it would be hard to balance school, spring softball, and pit orchestra, I knew I had to do it.Six months later, after countless rehearsals, meeting a few amazing new friends and two boxes of very expensive reeds, I was ready to perform. It was Friday night, the most important performance; judges from a local awards show were coming to watch and the auditorium was packed. I saw hundreds of people filing in, lots of parents, but lots of kids, too. The stage was set up with fog machines and strobe lights. I looked over at my stand partner, Jacob, to ask if he was ready. His face was stark white, almost as white as the performers on stage who were dressed as ghosts. He looked back at me and managed to say, \\'I\\'m sick,\\' before he got up and sprinted out of the auditorium, covering his mouth. My director looked at me and said \\'Looks like it\\'s up to you. Cover his part.\\' I was shocked. Jacob and I were the only two playing the clarinet. In the score there were times when it was just us playing, and now it was just me. However, I didn\\'t have time to think about my nervousness because the lights were dimming.I don\\'t remember much from the time the curtain opened to the time the curtain closed. I remember that my A was in tune for once and that Jacob never came back. I also remember how much fun I had. I listened to the cast singing along with my music and I felt so accomplished. They waited for me to start playing for their cues, and the audience clapped after they heard my solo. I was a part of something that people were actually paying money to watch. In the end, I didn\\'t get to die on stage in the arms of Maurius as Eponine, but playing the clarinet did allow me to live out my theatrical dream.\"}, {\"index\": 341, \"new_personal_statement\": \"In mere seconds, it\\'s all gone; the golden locks fall to the floor.Timidly, I gaze at the bald girl in the mirror, surrounded by thick chunks of my former hair. Scattered on the ground is an accumulation of dead cells, symbolic of a social structure that has long confined me. What I had once regarded as one of the greatest dimensions of my gender identity, my most prominent feminine trait, was no more than a slice through a strand of straw; the end of a cycle, an empty vacuum succeeding life. The fluorescent lamps of our school cafeteria flicker on and off.When a friend suggested that I should shave my head for an Amnesty campaign, I strongly opposed the idea. Why would I remove a trait so desired worldwide? Throughout my life, I have moved between geographical antipodes, yet all somewhat infused with the same cultural forces. From the straightened curls of my babysitter in Angola to the \\'ombr\\\\u00e9\\' tints of my Arabic teacher in the UAE, the same ideals were embedded everywhere. Across the world, women were fading their unique characteristics to conform to a single perception of beauty, manifested in my hair.It was a curious kind of privilege, one I was furious about, yet dreaded existing without. While Western beauty standards idealize straight, blonde hair, the associated stereotypes reduced me to an intellectually inferior, aesthetic value. I remember campaigning for my political party at sixteen, voices echoing that I was a \\'naive girl\\', as though they could render me ignorant by a glance. I remember feeling dismissed, subordinate.I remember my rage.And so, I vowed to shave my head, intending to break out of the notions that had preyed upon me since childhood.When contemplating my hesitation towards head-shaving, I realized that I was exemplifying ideals inconsistent with my own. Thus, I allowed my friend to plough the electric razor across my head, thereby proclaiming my proud ideological purity and progressive bona fides. A smug smile covered my lips. Finally, I was a true activist!Yet, as my shell cracked, a hideous, bald figure emerged.Devoid of femininity, unattractive. Instead of feeling empowered, I found myself more emotionally affected than I imagined. I felt insecure and vulnerable, stark naked.For months, I dared not look in mirrors, terrified of what they might reveal. I wore beanies at school, skipped social events, and withstood from debates. My flame was extinguished, suffocated by a deep aversion to my \\'unwomanly\\' exterior.How ironic was it, that the system I so passionately critiqued, the beast, was so alive inme?Some animals are afraid of the light. Their instinct is to avoid it, as darkness means safety from predators. I too had lived in the half-lit world of illusion, petrified of the glaring brightness. Suddenly, I was bald, fully exposed, unable to hide from anything. In hindsight, parting with my hair was not merely a stand against the status quo, but an exploration of the extent to which I was consumed by it.Haircuts are short-lived. The norms that haunt us are not quite so transient. These days, my hair touches my shoulders, and I doubt I will shave it again. Nevertheless, I will keep confronting the world around me, or tougher yet, my own views. I had assumed that the stumbling block to my protest would be social pressure, but found it was my own values. To ignore them is to accept unjust gender roles and beauty standards. To ignore them is to comply, to remain sheltered by one\\'s own privilege. Shaving my head was a catalyst, one that brought me to realize the importance of dipping into the unknown, of breaking out of bounds. It is by defying the patterns and cycles that have been constructed, that one may understand their ingrained nature; how they constitute every paradigm, how these may and will shift.\"}, {\"index\": 342, \"new_personal_statement\": \"When lightning stri-The music stopped. In that moment, the constant stream of sound in my head, just, stopped. Sound has been deeply embedded in me for as long as I can remember. It began during my toddler years as I attempted to express myself through song, but produced inexplicable sounds. My parents assumed something was wrong and brought me to Phoenix Children\\'s Hospital to visit a hearing specialist, but still, I produced no words--just sounds. As I entered kindergarten, they attempted to enroll me in a special needs school, but their efforts were quickly thwarted. July 20, 2016, 8:55pm: scrolling through Twitter, I stumbled upon a post reading \\'RIP Wade Young.\\' This was strange, because my best friend\\'s name is Wade Young. Just days ago, he came to my house and we were up until 5:30am talking as usual. I texted him. No answer. Wade went hiking that morning and assuming he hadn\\'t returned or just had bad reception, I proceeded to text him. After ten minutes with no response, I wandered into my parents\\' room and simply stated, \\'Mom, I think Wade died.\\' I could hear the confusion in my tone. She suggested I contact the other hikers, so I left messages for them, continuously texting Wade in between, but still, there was no answer. After tweeting, \\'Please tell me this isn\\'t real,\\' a close friend contacted me and explained the situation: the two other hikers were in the hospital and Wade was struck by lightning and killed. I was numb. This was wrong. They were wrong and I was going to prove it.There is a one in one million chance of being struck by lightning and only ten percent of people are actually killed. Even if the reports were true, Wade\\'s odds of surviving were ninety percent. The world makes more sense when I work through it logically. That night, I never cried. I never cried because this wasn\\'t real. Statistically speaking, everyone was wrong, and tomorrow, probability would prevail. He was only seventeen years old. We are not supposed to die at seventeen. I traveled to school to purchase books for my senior year, and as I pulled into the driveway on the long journey home, I first came to appreciate the phrase \\'the silence is deafening.\\' The music stopped. In that moment, the constant stream of sound in my head, just, stopped. With one hand on chest and one on mouth, my emotions spilled out uncontrollably. I had never felt such pain before and didn\\'t know how to manage the nosedive into sorrow. The music stopped. My world was silent. I was broken, and the person I went to when things like this happened, was gone.Eventually, the music returned. The stream of sound in my head slowly came back and the realization sent chills down my spine. Although, the music was different this time. It was stronger, full of aspiration and memories of Wade. Now, three months since the incident, I have a greater appreciation for time and how life can end in the middle of a sentence. My connection to Catholicism strengthened immensely and continues to guide me through this new world of mine. Every volt-colored object (his favorite color), mountain, and lightning flash I witness, I perceive as a sign from my friend: a stream of communication between heaven and the physical world. Learning how to continue to create goals while in a state of emotional instability has been extremely burdensome, but remembering how Wade conquered struggles in life has instilled within me a greater sense of determination. The determination to accomplish anything and everything in his honor. Similar to a lightning strike, Wade was energy. Upon his passing, the energy he possessed wasn\\'t lost; it was distributed amongst his closest friends, the same way lightning spreads when it strikes an object. That energy transferred and will live inside me forever.\"}, {\"index\": 343, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I subscribe to what theNew York Times dubs \\'the most welcomed piece of daily e-mail in cyberspace.\\' Cat pictures?

Examples of entoptic phenomena: floaters, thread-like fragments that appear to float in front of the eye but are caused by matter within the eye.(for a picture: https://wordsmith.org/words/entoptic.html) As I read through this entry, I was suddenly transported back to the first grade, when I was playing Pok\\\\u00e9mon Go one day with my friends during recess. Our version was epic: we escaped into virtual reality with our imagination rather than our phone screens, morphing into different Pok\\\\u00e9mon to do battle.My friend Ryan had just transformed into an invisible ghost-type Pok\\\\u00e9mon capable of evading my attacks.Flustered, I was attempting to evolve my abilities to learn to see the invisible. Between rubbing my eyes and squinting, I began to make out subtle specks in the air that drifted from place to place. Aha\\\\u2014the traces of the ghost Pok\\\\u00e9mon! I launched a thunderbolt straight through the air and declared a super-effective knockout....Of course, I never was able to explain what I was seeing to my bewildered friends that day in first grade. But after learning about entoptic phenomena, I realized that my entoptic adventure was not a hallucination but, in fact, one of my first intellectual milestones, when I was first able to connect meticulous observation of my environment to my imagination.Nowadays, I don\\'t just see minuscule entoptic phenomena: I see ghosts, too. Two of their names are Larry and Kailan, and they are the top-ranked players in the Exynos League.Exynos is the name of the elaborate basketball league I have created in my imagination over the last ten years of playing basketball on the neighborhood court in the evenings. As I play, I envision Larry and Kailan right there with me: reaching, stealing, and blocking. Undoubtedly, I might look a little silly when I throw the ball backwards as if Larry blocked my layup attempt\\\\u2014but imagining competitors defending me drives me to be precise in my execution of different moves and maneuvers. More than that, it is a constant motivator for all my endeavors: whether I\\'m researching for debate or studying for the next math contest, I am inventing and personifying new competitive ghosts that are hard at work every minute I\\'m off task.But I perceive perhaps the most vivid images through music, as I tell a different story with each piece I play on the violin. When I play Bach\\'s lively Prelude in E Major, for example, I visualize a mouse dashing up and down hills and through mazes to escape from an evil cat (\\\\u00e0 la Tom and Jerry). But when I play Tchaikovsky\\'s Violin Concerto, I describe a relationship plagued by unrequited love. I revel in the intellectual challenge of coming up with a story that is not only consistent with the composer\\'s annotations but also resonates with my own experiences.Between re-living Tom and Jerry episodes and shooting fadeaway three-pointers against ghosts, then, perhaps entoptic phenomena don\\'t tell my whole story.

Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family.Growing up, I would race downstairs after dinner almost every night to sing along to the famous Full House theme song. Indeed, this cheesy family sitcom filled with overly dramatic acting, fascinating 90s fashion, Uncle Jesse\\'s smooth charm, and, most importantly, tear-jerking family moments most positively impacted my life. This realization didn\\'t come until I had my very own \\'Full House moment\\' with my younger sister. It was out of this seemingly ordinary moment that I transitioned from childhood to adulthood. At first glance, my life might look nothing like the Tanners\\'. I belong to a family from Ethiopia and moving to America created unique internal and external conflicts centered around learning to adapt to the juxtaposing cultures that I was immersed in. I have had to learn how to speak English and assimilate to American customs at school while still speaking my native tongue and maintaining my Ethiopian identity at home. Apart from these considerable cultural difference, however, I find myself relating to DJ in many ways. Being the oldest child, I often times get into the same arguments with my brother and sister over things like them going through my stuff as DJ does with her two younger sisters. Furthermore, while I wouldn\\'t say she is as weird as Kimmy, I have a best friend who helps me to navigate through the ups and downs of life. Lastly, like DJ, I have also had to cope with the death of my mother; but thankfully, similar to Full House, I have a loving father and kind relatives who have supported me through it. When I was eleven years old, my mom passed away of cancer. This had a significant impact on my life as it forced me to assume a bigger role in my siblings\\' upbringing. While this role has helped to make me more responsible and caring, it created pressure to set a good example. Constantly worrying how my actions will affect my siblings made me question my abilities as a student, a tennis player, a violinist, a debater, an orator, and a sister. Similarly to DJ, I conceived an unrealistic idea that the only way to fulfill this role was by never making mistakes. My fear of failure made me feel inadequate. Finally, one night my sister showed me that I didn\\'t need to be perfect to be a good role model and that the love that my siblings had for me was not something I had to earn. Since my mother passed along her thick, curly hair genes to us, having to detangle my sister\\'s hair is a task for two sets of hands. This became our nightly ritual. As I rake the comb through her brown, coarse ringlets, we always poke fun at each other. I laughingly remind her of how she looks like a poodle, and she retorts with snarky comebacks, like the fact that I look like a lion with an unruly mane. On one particular night, however, my sister was oddly silent with a sullen look plastered on her face. When I asked her what was wrong, she replied by saying, \\'Milki, if you go away for college, will you still be around to help me?\\' Unable to formulate words and with tears rolling down my cheeks, I reassuringly embraced my little sister. It felt like a snapshot resemblance of the coming of age moments DJ has with Stephanie at the end of the episodes. It was then that the weight on my shoulders was lifted. I finally allowed myself to remove the facade that I had always put up. I realized my happiness didn\\'t need to be compromised in order to be the person that my family needed me to be because I was already her. So in a turn of events, it was in this \\'Full House-like\\' event that my younger sister taught me the most important lesson of all: self-acceptance.\"}, {\"index\": 347, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 348, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 349, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I have always had mixed feelings about religion throughout my life. I was raised Episcopalian, and I was taught by my peers that every good boy and girl went to church with their families. Right from the beginning, I questioned this concept due to the frequent absence of my father. As I have grown older, and come to understand life through my own lens, I have begun to distance myself from the ideas imposed by the church due to my own principles: How could I love a God who hated people like my friends? How could I love a God who hated my sister for who she loved? I had refused to be a part of religion due to the exclusivity embraced by so many. Despite this, religion found a way to make a significant impact in my life recently. I traveled to New Orleans with my school jazz band to perform at local venues and to experience the southern music culture. I had been skeptical about this trip, this would be the first time I had ever been to Louisiana, and it would mark the first experience I had in the Deep South. Living in Connecticut my entire life, I have grown to accept the \\'norms\\' of southern people: bigotry, ignorance, and poverty, mostly from my father\\'s experience in Georgia. Being of mixed race and fairly liberal minded, I figured that I would not approve of what I would experience. When I had learned that we were to perform at a church, all my fears and assumptions amplified tenfold. Religion was still a very intimidating idea to me at the time and, with this mixed with my stereotyping of southern people, I began to feel ill. Being the lead flute player in my band, I had to continue with the performance regardless.I was awestruck by what I saw when I first entered the unexpectedly beautiful church. I saw a mixed congregation of black and white people sitting, completely integrated. The pastor walked up to the altar and greeted the congregation, and thanked our band for travelling to their church to perform. As the pastor began his sermon, he explained the mission of the church, taking specific note to the famous John 3:16 verse, stating its meaning was too exclusive; therefore, he wanted to work on an all-inclusive community of faith and love. He believed it would only allow God\\'s redemption to those who believe in him. This was obviously his goal, as the congregation reflected an inclusive environment. My confidence in the church\\'s ideology was solidified at the end of the service. The entire congregation, black and white, joined hands and began to sing together joyfully. As a child of a black father and a white mother, this was the defining moment of the experience. The celebration of sameness has always been important to me, but this experience has inspired me to make a difference in the world. Also, I have allowed myself to grow an affinity towards religion. While I may not believe in an omnipresent God, I understand religion\\'s importance for others. It is true that religion creates oppression and violence that people today still face. However, without it, we would not have the togetherness that religion spawns. The stereotyping of anything, whether religion, race, or other, creates an ignorance that I have experienced despite my extremely accepting personality. Therefore, from this experience, I strive to remove that ignorance with education and love throughout my everyday life. Hopefully we will one day see a world of people holding hands and singing joyfully, in complete togetherness and harmony. \"}, {\"index\": 350, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I\\'m sitting in my fifth grade classroom, and a black cat towers over me. The cat, easily as big as my nine-year-old self, reigns over Ms. Garza\\'s class from a poster, stretching from floor to ceiling and calling my attention. The words \\'Tournee du Chat Noir de Rodolphe Salis\\' in swirling lettering confounds me. That is not English. My inability to comprehend the English letters in this new form bothers me. There is a problem here.Growing up in the midwest, the language of French seemed as attainable to me as the actual nation of France, a thousand dollar plane ticket and an eternity away. English dominated my passions as a child, from discovering the word \\'nuptial\\' in the first line of A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream to the inability to resist the call of Harry Potter\\'s adventures after the rest of family had gone to bed. However, this language of French enticed me with new challenges, new literature, nouvelles aventures de Harry Potter. The summer after my first encounter with the black cat, I watched as Beijing dazzled the international community with the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games. The spirit of the Olympics awed me, and all the while, every announcement was made in three languages: English, commonplace and understandable; Chinese, interesting but completely foreign; and French, simple, beautiful, and enticing, yet all too far away.This language, unknown to everyone in my family except for me, offered a kind of poetry that eluded me in every day life. With my father\\'s extreme depression (self-medicated with alcohol), fights between my parents about money and jobs were commonplace, everyday events, and the elegance of French appealed to me as an escape to counter the harsh English at home. I still loved English, but there was an entirely new kind of poetry that now awaited me. However, it was still just out of my reach. I loved English: nevertheless, the words and mystery of the black cat stayed with me as I learned to use English in new ways in Speech and Debate, debated my friends on politics, as I read about the United Nations. When I entered high school in Colorado, in a new state and with new people, I faced the decision of either French II or Spanish I. Despite my complete lack of experience with any foreign language, there was no question. I had to figure out what that black cat was trying to tell me.Since then, I have worked diligently, entering the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program with French, and am now the only candidate taking a higher level exam in French in my class. It was (and is) hard work, teaching myself the basics, having to listen to how to make the nasal \\'n\\' sound for pronunciation, not only getting caught up to my more experienced classmates, but moving forward with the goal of eventually becoming fluent in the language of le chat noir. My love of French, the way it unites nations through the Olympics and through the United Nations, has driven me to love international relations, as well as how the world works.That black cat, the poster that has led my inquisitive journey through French, now hangs on my wall, the message \\'Tour of the Black Cat of Rodolphe Salis\\' comprehensible to me at last. Not the world-altering prophesy that could have been hidden in the letters back in fifth grade, but the black cat started me on a journey of a love of the international spirit, the love of communication of any kind, and the love of a language that is all at once the world\\'s and my very own.\"}, {\"index\": 351, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'You were born in Vietnam, you are French, but you speak perfect English\\\\u2026 Can you explain your life tome?\\'asked the Customs Officer in Logan Airport two years ago.

I firmly believed that they were the richest people in the world until I learned that Bill Gates, the wealthiest man, was somehow not a cashier. This first introduction to the economics left me with a lot of questions.When I was three, my family moved from Poland to Russia where life for me was comprised by a series of concentric circles: the smallest of these were our cozy flat and the sheltered environment of my expatriate kindergarten. As I grew and my circles expanded outward, however, I began to experience the contrast between my curated safe spaces and the daunting environment surrounding me on the streets. There were neighborhoods I got used to hurrying through when my mom walked me to school squeezing my hand tight; evidence of drugs, prostitution, and street gangs contrasted with stark stolidity of the Khrushchyovka concrete apartment buildings that reefed Moscow like layers of gray coral. I overwhelmed my parents with questions; I needed to understand why things were so different. They comforted me as best they could, but they did not have the answers.Over time, I have been lucky enough to travel to over thirty countries. Though the specific examples varied, I came to realize that income inequality was a constant regardless of geography: the wealthy lived well and the poor struggled for access to food, shelter, basic healthcare. I turned to the social sciences in search of the answers my parents had not been able to give. Economics, history, and politics became tools for understanding the diversity of economic opportunity I encountered in Mexico, Russia, Singapore, Vietnam, and the US.My IB HL Economics course at the American School of Warsaw cemented my interest in the economics of the developing world. I became increasingly fascinated by wealth distribution and the ebb and flow of money. I wrote my IB Extended Essay (EE) on a local issue: \\'The Market Structure of the Local Fruit and Vegetable Bazaar.\\' I determined that the bazaar functioned as a microcosm of broader aspirations and tensions in Polish society. It was fascinating to juxtapose the vendors\\' perspectives and their practical plans for sustainability with what I learned at University of Chicago summer program Getting to Green: Making the Business Case for Sustainability. Perhaps the most challenging thing I learned in the course of my EE research is that the developed world leverages its outsized economic power to increase potential growth while developing countries \\\\u2013 and local subsistence and small-yield farmers as represented by my bazaar merchants \\\\u2013 struggle to meet their basic needs.Child labor \\\\u2013 a pandemic problem in developing economies \\\\u2013 became a central research interest of mine. As with my child\\'s notion of the lives of cashiers, I have learned that the answers are not necessarily in plain sight: not all the money is in the tray. We cannot eliminate child labor simply by banning imports from countries that allow it, because unless we create compensatory local economic opportunities, doing so will simply stimulate competing production from less-regulated or black market sectors.Recently, I worked with the Save the Children initiative to sponsor two children in Mali who would otherwise have been forced to work. While this localized step lacks the global significance of legislation such as the US Child Labor Deterrence Act, it can nevertheless achieve results: the children have been able to remain in school. I plan to study business and economics at university in order to participate in addressing the plight of child laborers through ethical, sustainable business.Basing our efforts on moral arguments alone, we are unlikely to succeed in eradicating child labor. Rather, we need to affect policy and practice in such a way that companies which make use of child labor are compromised in their bottom lines, while simultaneously offering attractive alternative pathways for businesses and children alike.\"}, {\"index\": 354, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Pushing Through the DoorThe fresh, overly hygienic smell that hospitals always to seem to have filled my nostrils, just as the rancid odor of the street vacated them. I felt the cool, artificial breeze of the air conditioning on my lips, which I had whet as I prepared to speak.\\'How bad is it?\\' I asked my mom.\\'Bad,\\' she replied. Her eyes filling with tears, she continued, \\'It\\'s the chemotherapy. It\\'s like she has no muscles; she can only move her eyes.\\'In that moment, I imagined looking at my childhood friend, Layla. I imagined her eyes darting back and forth, then settling on me as I walked through the door, looking to me to solve her problems like I used to when we were little.Although, back then, her problems were little cuts and scabs compared to Leukemia.As I realized I could do nothing to help, my heart sank into my chest, hiding behind my lungs as a child hides behind his mother\\'s skirt.I was scared of what I would see, and even more of what I would remember.As I wiped my hands clean, I thought of how great it would be to be able to wipe what I was about to witness from my memory. Even better, to wipe her body clean of disease.I finished sanitizingand turned to push open the wide, wooden door that separated Layla and I.I began to push it open. It felt, in my mind, heavier than it should have, and I thought of how it weighed a thousand tons, just as my hands pushed it open with ease.\\'You don\\'t have to go.You shouldn\\'t go,\\' my dad had told me. I didn\\'t want to see her like this, but I knew I had to.With one final push, I stepped into the room and turned towards her.Later that day, my dad turned to face me and said, \\'As your father, I have to love you, but I don\\'t have to respect you.Today you earned my respect. You could have chosen the easy option and stayed away from that hospital. Instead, you made the difficult choice and the right choice, even though I discouraged it. You knew what you would see, but that didn\\'t stop you from supporting your friend. It was very mature of you. After what I\\'ve seen in you today, I\\'ve changed my mind about your college applications. You can apply anywhere you want; you don\\'t have to stay in Lebanon. Having said this, I still think you should stay here. There are some good schools and it\\'ll just be a lot easier for you. It\\'s up to you now, though.\\'I see life as a continuous series of doors. Each door represents an opportunity, each opportunity represents a risk, and each risk represents a choice that must be made. That\\'s how you evolve:you make a decision to take a risk to pursue an opportunity. Then you do it again.To me, doors have never been barriers, but rather, invitations.I have spent much of my life pushing through them, and I will continue to do so.In fact, this application is another push through a door. Hopefully, this door will lead to something as remarkable as what that hospital door led to.I walked through the door and turned towards Layla. She looked just as sick as I was told she would. Except, in my mind, in my words, and in my actions, she wasn\\'t sick at all. I talked, I joked, I laughed,we laughed, interrupted only by the shriek of a stunned nurse. \\'How did you get like that?\\' she exclaimed.

Her boyfriend was twenty-one and a heroin addict. He was, and is, absent from my life. My second father, who my mother married when I was three, wasn\\'t any better. Over time he revealed himself to be an incredibly hostile, abusive man whom, luckily, my mother divorced. Following their separation, my mother and I found ourselves scattered all over the place. She took jobs as a showgirl in Vegas, cleaned toilets in Utah, and even modeled in Denmark to make ends meet. Although I always felt very lucky for the opportunity to travel around, it left me with a void in terms of where \\'home\\' should be. Change quickly became a major theme of my childhood, setting the stage for the next fifteen years of my life. Religion, particularly Mormonism, served as the foundation, something that grounded me despite constant displacement.In my life there occurred a huge shift after I found the website Rookie Mag and started studying feminist theory. This newfound literary content shook my world and opened up the little cocoon of a community that I felt trapped in. Each work of literature I consumed felt like a revolution, making apparent certain issues within the Mormon Church. I began to feel immoral in associating myself with a religion whose ideas conflicted with my personal values. I spent countless hours researching religious texts cover to cover, desperately seeking some divine response. When I realized the extent of my disillusionment, I was terrified of being rejected by my family; however, I redirected my energy into writing. Despite attending a new high school every year, I was able to hold leadership positions in various clubs and interviewed musicians for a music blog I created. Following graduation, in a final attempt to rediscover my faith, I enrolled at Brigham Young University.At the time I made this decision, everything in my life felt very much out of my control. I was preparing to move yet again, and was also in the midst of dealing with a really frightening experience of assault. Emotionally drained and physically powerless, I felt an urge to claim power over my life and establish an autonomy that I never fully accessed until then. I submitted a piece to Rookie Mag and was asked to regularly contribute. Soon I became more interested in freelance writing than the journalism courses at school, where I was not allowed to publish anything deemed too progressive. I was disappointed with the censorship of my writing, speech, attire, and my inability to leave Mormonism without getting expelled from school.Ultimately, the friends I made through Rookie gave me the courage I needed to leave the Mormon Church and Brigham Young University. Despite having no financial or familial support, I moved to New York and sought to live on my own and rewire what was engrained in me by my Mormon upbringing. Despite experiencing uncertainty, loneliness, depression, and the loss of my religion, I have learned to embrace change as something beautiful. Having had to integrate myself into foreign environments, I have developed a deep compassion and empathy for people deemed \\'outsiders\\'. I know that there are constants in life that can guide us when everything around us is changing, and those constants for me have always been books, writing, and a curiosity toward everything. For my entire life I have longed to experience an open-minded, secular education and I\\'ve realized that I need structure in order to develop my voice and ability as a writer. I look forward to developing close ties with professors who do not censor students or insert their religious convictions into their narrative. Through participating in provocative and challenging courses, I hope to actualize my academic, creative, and professional pursuits.\"}, {\"index\": 357, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Before starting the ignition, I glance over my shoulder to the back seat to make sure my siblings have their seatbelts fastened.

It\\'s an opportunity to upgrade his worn out green belt to a cooler blue one. As we head out to our destinations, I reminisce about my own childhood. Seventeen years ago, my parents and I began our American journey in a one room, inner city Philadelphia apartment. Scraping by paycheck to paycheck, there was little opportunity for hobbies for us. Still, I was grateful for my parents\\' efforts; on top of starting a new church, my dad also worked the graveyard shift at a local Seven-Eleven. My mom taught piano to make extra money. In this foreign country, they had no connections and did not know the language, but they were relentless. By persevering through economic difficulties and language barriers, they were living embodiments of the term \\'hard work.\\' I slowly push on the brake as we stop at a red light, and my shoulders sag. My eyelids feel heavier with each passing second. Coming straight from a long day of school, I had no time to rest before driving my siblings around. For a moment, I consider driving back home to sleep, but I glance at my rearview mirror, at my sister happily humming a Disney song under her breath, and at my brother making miniature chopping motions with his hands. Their energy is contagious. The light flashes green and I continue driving. When my little brother was born ten years ago, I was no longer the center of attention. After my little sister came along four years later, I received even less of the spotlight. My parents, who once had so much vigor, were visibly fatigued; the addition of two members confined my dad to longer work days and my mom to staying home. Naturally, I became more independent, becoming a parental figure to my siblings. However, when I entered high school, it became challenging to maintain my familial responsibilities and keep up academically. I wanted to be a good brother, but not at the expense of my grades and passions. Exhausted after school, I spent nights multitasking, attempting to balance homework and extracurriculars while taking care of my siblings. I trudged along, taking feelings of inadequacy with me every night as I collapsed into bed. But from my parents, who overcame adversities of all kinds, I knew that giving up was not the solution. Instead, I adapted to this new lifestyle by setting a disciplined schedule and prioritizing the most important activities. When I thought I had reached my limits, I worked harder, eventually finding success in rigorous classes and managing my responsibilities at home.We arrive at our first destination, the Tae Kwon Do center. My little brother\\'s hand visibly trembles as he reaches to open the car door. As he walks inside, I yell words of encouragement.Even the smallest responsibilities- helping with homework, solving dilemmas, and communicating with their teachers- have influenced me as a person. Through my close relationship with my siblings, I learned to be empathetic, to understand their problems and solve them together. I matured quickly as a young role model, using reasoning rather than emotion to analyze issues. Progressively, these traits translated into the other things I did. Because of my experiences at home, I demonstrated unique leadership abilities in school, heading multiple clubs and organizations.This familial relationship has framed a guiding philosophy: a perennial desire to help others. This mentality inspired my involvement in mission trips, acts of community service, and the establishment of a nonprofit company. In college, I wish to cultivate and develop this ideology.Finally, we arrive at the YMCA. I turn to ask my sister if she wants me to go inside with her, but she is already halfway out of the car. Although it has been difficult at times, I am thankful for the circumstances I have gone through, and the responsibilities I have been given.

The first thing my family\\'s farm taught me was to learn by doing. Because of that, I built my trebuchet. Time for the second shot. I pulled the arm to the ground. A quick hand wave signaled my brother to load the rock. I released the arm. The weight plummeted, the arm swung, and the whole trebuchet collapsed into a heap of broken wood. The second thing I learned is that nothing goes as planned. A few weeks of hard work later, and I had reconstructed the trebuchet. The third thing I learned is that failure is just something to learn from.When I was seven, my family moved to my grandparents\\' farm in West Virginia. Everyone had plans. My grandfather planned to run the farm into his seventies and my dad planned to help. My parents planned to homeschool their children. For a while, the plans worked. My grandfather bought a tractor and a bulldozer. My dad took a job selling music, but was able to help out in the evenings and on the weekends. My mom gardened and taught my siblings and I at home. Farms are incubators of curiosity. Growing up, I was surrounded by equipment, tools, electricity, and mechanics. Animals constantly lived, grew, reproduced, and died all around me. Every day I asked the questions, \\'Why, what, and how?\\' How does this valve control the water flow? What materials stop electricity? Why does this this motor spin? If I cut this tree, will it fall on that power line? I found my answers by pure exploration. Valves got taken apart. I touched different tools to the electric fence until I found one that wouldn\\'t shock me. As I grew older, I discovered that math and physics held the answers to my questions. The motor spins because a current flowing through a coil around a magnet makes the magnet spin. I measured the tree using a sextant and trigonometry. When I applied my learning, I found I could answer the most important question, \\'How can I do this better?\\' With learning, I found that I could make the lives of those around me easier.Farming is hard.It\\'s a full-time commitment regardless of the circumstances. There are animals to be fed, gardens to tend, and a constant cycle of maintenance to be tackled every single day. As I said, nothing goes as planned. Just a few years after buying the farm, my grandfather was killed driving his tractor. I was 12 when he died; after that, my dad was in charge of the farm. However, farming isn\\'t profitable, and he still had to work a full-time job. With my dad at work, most of the day-to-day tasks were my responsibility. I condensed my schoolwork into three or four hours a day, and I spent another three or four hours working. I quickly learned to feed, weedeat, and build fences. When my dad came home from work, we worked together to finish whatever I wasn\\'t strong enough or skilled enough to do on my own.A few years later, my parents both took teaching jobs at a tiny Christian school, and my three siblings and I enrolled in the school. I was fifteen when I began attending school as a sophomore. The school wasn\\'t ideally equipped. There were few classes more advanced than \\'honors\\' classes, but I thrived in the newfound academic structure. The plan seemed to go well. With the extra time in the summers, the farm was more productive than ever before. However, after a year of teaching, my father had a past cancer return.

That slightest contact can spark a deep discovery. And even the smallest discovery can then spark a full life of intellectual curiosity. This realization has given my life an immense purpose. I aim to see the world with the same wonder and awe a child sees a cockroach.I started visiting the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia from the moment I could walk, running from display to volunteer, absorbing like a sponge every ounce of information I could. I have now been volunteering there in a hands-on learning exhibit which houses numerous live mammals and insects for four years. It took me weeks to present, with confidence, the biographies of animals, from their specific life stories to the stories of their species in the wild. Those weeks I spent in training is when I rediscovered the wonder and awe that sponge-like toddler once had in the same hallways and more importantly, when I knew a life driven by intellectual curiosity was essential to living.Encounters with the animals alone have consumed much of my time and attention. Being able to appreciate the household menace, the cockroach, as an indispensable member of society and also as a beautifully designed creature, has truly been a lesson in humility, demonstrating that I know only a small fraction of the world. Moreover, this lesson has been a flame to light my inner fire. I know I must discover the world. Further, I must bring others with me. Another aspect of my volunteer experience and an an integral part of my own education, is educating others. Witnessing that spark in visitors has strengthened my convictions about the power of education, and deepened my own pursuit of knowledge. From the museum, I have taken leaps in my learning: from child to adult, from cockroaches to enlightenment. And in attempting to return the gesture, I am continually given more.No matter the path, I know this intellectual curiosity and the exchange of knowledge, ideas, and perceptions are my life\\'s pursuits. When asked to touch a Madagascar Hissing Cockroach, my answer will always be yes.\"}, {\"index\": 362, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'I think we messed up in our role selection.

Doctors and nurses rushed about, charts rustling and keyboards clacking. Amid the chaos, I noticed a group of doctors speaking animatedly as they exited an \\'Isolation\\' room. A giant sanitizer dispenser on the wall, surrounded by posters and red arrows, reminded them to wash up. As an emergency light flared, they tore off their gloves and rushed past the sanitizer, forgoing the perfunctory disinfecting process. My stomach churned as I thought of my father\\'s year of grueling chemotherapy in rooms like these, where my mother and I had obsessed over keeping his space sterile. While shadowing at the hospital, it was made clear that strict sanitation was mandatory to prevent infection. Viscerally disturbed and intrigued by what I had just witnessed, I felt the urge to investigate.  I scoured an abundance of literature on infection protocols and requested the hospital\\'s relevant statistics. I was met with strong resistance. Each office led to yet another; the confidentiality forms I signed piled up. Through closed doors, I heard administrators say, \\'Who is this kid?\\' Yet I persisted because it was not only about questioning what I saw, but also about patients\\' lives at stake. Before long, a stack of papers thudded heavily on the table before me: the hospital records. I pored over them, comparing the data to national trends and finding telling correlations. My research revealed that the issue was one of inconvenience; doctors didn\\'t have time to vigorously rub sanitizer for a full minute before entering each room. Moreover, I realized traditional protocol solely focused on raising awareness without addressing the issue of time. One day, as I was wracking my brain for a solution, I caught a glimpse of my mother\\'s Keurig machine spurting out coffee. This sparked an idea to design my own device, one that similarly sprays quick-drying sanitizer into doctors\\' hands and saves time.  The next few weeks blurred together as I designed several versions of my prototype. I expected the process to be daunting but wasn\\'t quite prepared for the initial deluge of discouraging responses. A lukewarm letter from XXXXXXX explained that regretfully, they couldn\\'t provide feedback; hospital engineers told me it would be too expensive. Finally, I found an opportunity to present my idea to the world: the national XXXXXXX competition. XXXXXXX required identifying a community problem, creating a solution, and presenting it to earn a partnership with an innovation firm. After rounds of essays and interviews, I made it to the final stage: a professional pitch for a large audience of potential investors. This was the moment I had been waiting for. My throat was dry and my palms were slick with sweat as I tried to rein in my nervousness. I scanned the crowd until my eyes settled on my father in the second row. With an enthusiastic grin, he leaned forward and nodded gently.He was the true inspiration for my project, and his presence reminded me of my goal. A calm washed over me, and I launched into my pitch. Moments later, strips of confetti rained down on me as I faintly heard my name. After advancing past more than 160 other candidates, I won!  I\\'m now collaborating with an innovation firm to file a patent and bring XXXXXXXX to market. Meeting stringent CDC regulations has resulted in an ever-evolving project. I\\'ve discovered the cultural barriers, the bureaucratic hurdles, and the comfortable complacency that often compound matters and slow reform. Even though there isn\\'t always a quick solution to wash away our problems, I plan to keep asking difficult questions and challenging the status quo. We just need the eye to observe, the courage to speak up, and the will to change.On the ride home from my first regional Congressional Debate tournament, I rubbed my hands together in anticipation. A shiny third place trophy glinted next to me. Oh boy, feedback time. I glanced at the crinkled envelope in my lap and bit my lip nervously. Slowly, I peeled back the flap, keen to see the raw, unfiltered critiques.\\'Histrionic? Overly assertive?\\' How was this possible? Just the day before, my captain advised me to challenge my competitors with a bit more emotion and gusto, and I\\'d done so. Or so I thought. Shuffling through the rest of the papers, I noticed the comments were mostly positive, praising my passion and unique arguments. They were also peppered with disparaging remarks about traits like my unimposing stature and \\'feminine voice.\\' I\\'d soon transcend these remarks, but my first instinct was to cave in to the judges\\' demands\\\\u2014like a thorn bending to honeysuckles. I reviewed hours of debate rounds recorded from previous years; the most successful debaters spoke in booming, thunderous tones, stood authoritatively, and gestured with purpose. I started imitating the mostly male competitors, mouthing words in sync with them, moving my hands like them and even breathing like them. Supposedly, a sip of hot water before rounds would deepen my voice and shifting my stance would command more presence. I mean, it made sense: this style worked for others, so this was what I should aim for. But a feeling in my stomach gnawed away at me. Were all of these actions representative of myself? I shrugged the feeling off, however, because I wanted to become a stronger debater the tried-and-true way. It didn\\'t work. The judges saw right through my plastic fa\\\\u00e7ade. Their comments transformed, criticizing my now mechanical nature and generic arguments. They were no longer commenting on my \\'feminine\\' traits but chastising me for sacrificing the defining features of my personality: vibrant, vocal, and unapologetic. It\\'d always felt wrong to scrub away my quirks, but after these remarks, I received the wake-up call that I needed to pursue my own potential rather than a stereotype. Determined to enhance my existing strengths, I trained with my debate coach to make my natural voice stronger, to project genuine confidence, and to display my passion in such a way that no one would doubt my sincerity. So when the increasingly positive feedback rolled in, I affirmed the value of staying true to myself. Like honeysuckles embracing an unbending thorn, the judges began to accept me for who I was. I recognized I wasn\\'t the only one facing an internal conflict. With that in mind, I approached new girls on my team and others at local tournaments. I set up informal practice sessions in which we bonded over shared experiences of discouragement. Together, we reasoned that it was inherently unrealistic to achieve preconceived \\'standards of perfection.\\' Instead, we collectively aspired to be our best selves. We built upon our strengths and emphasized our unique attributes, mutually empowering one another to preserve our identities and ensure that our performances accurately represented our individual characters. Rather than aspiring to be like someone else, it was far more fulfilling to be myself. I advanced further in tournaments with pride, knowing that my personality was present in every speech I gave. Debate has always been a search for truth in rounds, but now it is also a search for truth on a personal level. In attempting to bend to the judges\\' stereotypes, I reaffirmed to myself the importance of integrity and self-awareness. Although I don\\'t live in nineteenth-century England, one thing Bront\\\\u00eb and I can agree on is the importance of maintaining personal integrity and embracing your true self.\"}, {\"index\": 364, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 365, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Varsity cross country, homecoming court, level ten gymnast, fluency in Spanish by freshman year, and QuestBridge finalist all are among my list of things I was not successful in completing. Although not receiving these titles and honors would come as so called \\'failures\\' to many, I find them to be successes in various ways. We are often asked to reflect on a time where we \\'failed\\'. We are continuously advised to \\'learn from our failures\\' and according to most, our failures are what make the foundation for later success. To me, failure doesn\\'t occur in human life. Failure cannot be connected to a living human, only to that of inanimate objects. We strive to complete everything we embark upon, and as human beings, we desire to be the best, not to use the word almost, and to reach success in everything we do, yet continue to live with the na\\\\u00efve frame of mind where failure exists. Defined by Merriam-Webster dictionary as, \\'Lack of success\\', failure is one of the most misinterpreted words in the human language. To break that definition down further, the word \\'lack\\' is defined as, \\'To be deficient or missing\\'. With the appropriate perspective and attitude towards situations, failure by definition is impossible to find. I grew up being taught that everything I did would help my future, and would contribute to my life in some yet to be discovered way. This means, that success exists in every situation. What we encounter can be viewed as a journey, and the journey is what shapes us, the journey is what makes us an individual, and the journey is what makes us who we are. My journey has placed me in the exact situation I am today. My journey has been an artist, molding me, shaping me, and sculpting me to be the unique piece of art titled Sarah Caitlin McKay. You can view the artwork of my life as beautiful, or damaged. You can see that I have failed, or you can see that I have had different degrees of success. You can choose to be the one who suffers from adversities, or is held back by the emotional mayhem you have been sent through. To live life to its potential, and to focus on the journey, I have chosen to perceive my hardships as blessings and my commonly referred to as \\'failures\\' simply as situations with less success. The tough times in my life are never the downfall or ruination in my success. The adversity I have and will face is what has made and will continue to make me who I am. It is what has provided me with my knowledge, perspective, and insight I have to bring to situations, and it has shown me that I am capable of overcoming tribulations both mentally and physically. Through my sixteen years of life, I have come to many conclusions, one of the most important being that the sheer completion of a task, (a very important part), is nowhere near the significance of the steps you took to get to that point. You may find yourself in situations where completion is out of reach, however through that process, you have found success. The experiences one encounters, are worth more than a number, title, or award. The person who has faced adversity, rejection, and disappointment, is worth more than one who is perfect on paper. A name and number only travels a certain distance. We become complacent to what is in front of us, lose patience, and get caught in a pessimistic mindset seeing only failure, a concept which we as humans innately find to be true.\"}, {\"index\": 366, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Prompt: Describe one way in which you have contributed to yourcommunity.Excitement rushed through me as I gazed at dinosaur skeletons and an enormousthree-dimensional periodic table during my first visit to my local museumof natural science.

Nevertheless, Jenn struggled in the large-group martial arts classes, so when her parents contacted me about working with Jenn one-on-one, I happily agreed.However, as soon as the lesson began, I discovered a problem. Because of Jenn\\'s muscular degeneration, her body was unable to position itself correctly; consequently, the punch she aimed at the board never had enough power to crack it. As she struggled, I scoured my mind for a way to provide Jenn with a little more power or precision. No matter what I tried, Jenn was unable to make even the slightest fracture in the board. After thirty agonizing minutes, Jenn\\'s bruised hands dropped to her sides, dejection and tears welling up in her eyes.

I shook ----\\'s hand to congratulate him and walked out in disbelief.I joined debate with the mindset that I could make my own arguments and have my opinions affirmed.

That round, I learned that winning a debate is less about understanding your own argument than it is about understanding your opponent\\'s.----- probably has no recollection of the round, but for me, it was a catalyst. This cartoon-light-bulb moment made me realize that my conception of what it meant to be a debater was wrong.

So from then on, no matter what topic was thrown my way, I was constantly looking at it through different points of view and frames of reference.It\\'s ironic that a sport that pits competitors against one another, also teaches tolerance and understanding; however, the greatest debaters are the ones with open minds.

Many people see this as a way to feel pity for me, but I use it as my motivation to become something large in life. I was required to work at an early age to help my mother with small bills and buy materials that I desired but were not essential to live. We were forced many times to move from home to home because of financial reasons.  We had moved from Hayward to Newark to San Bruno and finally to Oakland. Waking up at two in the morning, every weekend, I dragged myself out of my bed to put some old raggy sweat pants on and a sweater that I believed would keep me warm from the danger outside. I would put on my sneakers that seemed to be aged almost 5 years and go to the restroom to moisten my face and bring myself out of my dream world and into reality. Water dripping down my face, I thought to myself \\'Do it for her..\\' building up the energy to last for another long day. I slumped my way to our van, and quietly slid into my seat, resting my eyes for the final time that morning. My mom got into the car and saw my face, no more spark that I had as a young kid, not a smile on my face, but a face that has been forced to mature for his family. She tapped my head, saying \\' Do not worry mijo, it\\'ll get better soon...I promise..\\'. I looked up and forced a smile on my face, as I saw the pain that resided in her eyes, knowing that the promise she made may never actually come true. Our van came to a stop, signaling it was time for work. I inserted my earphones, and started to play some music, the beats of the music synchronizing with my heart, forcing me to swing the doors open and begin carrying out the boxes and placing them in order. As I saw the boxes lined up in order outside the van, I began to say, \\'This is my life..and I will make the best of it\\'. Walking to our post, I started to get ready for the day to come. The above routine was my weekend from the seventh grade to last year. To make extra income, I helped my mother working at the Laney Flea Market.  As painstaking as it was, it was there that I learned how to see life in a different perspective. I met many people that taught me how to become more responsible but also to enjoy life. In addition to the flea market job, my mother and I delivered newspapers.  At that time, we were living in my aunt\\'s basement because rent was too high back in Newark. We woke up at 2 a.m., delivered papers to the residents of the Bay Area, got home at 8 a.m., ate a bit of breakfast then it was off to school for me.  During the weekend, after breakfast we then left to the flea market to work there until 5 in the afternoon. After finding a home in Oakland, my mom quit her job at the SF Chronicle and found a job a few months later as a waitress at IHOP. In my junior year of high school, I worked with her at IHOP as a host.  Once again, my mom and I were working side by side.  After a long day at work, we compared our feet.

Even though I am currently not working with my mom, our shared experience has taught me the importance of striving in school to secure my future.My experience makes me who I am. I was always good at academics but only during the years that I started working I realized just how important education was for not only me, but my mother as well. My past has helped me decide my future because I want to be able to help many people who cannot afford their healthcare and be a change for humanity.\"}, {\"index\": 371, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Within the first five minutes of our training, I had already failed. Exiting a calm eddy, I leaned a little too much, and flipped my boat. My Uncle Eric had invited me and my Dad on a white water kayaking trip down the wild and scenic portion of the Rogue River in Oregon. I had never kayaked before and was the youngest by 15 years. Our training lasted two days, and then our group embarked on a five day trip through Class III and IV rapids. In white water kayaking, when you flip your boat, you have three options. The first, and best option, is to roll back up and continue paddling. The second is to stay in the boat, hold your breath, and wait for someone to rescue you while you bounce through the rapids. The third is the \\'swim,\\' in which you bail out, losing paddle and boat, and float through the rapids with only your life vest. Being a beginner, I was far away from learning to roll and was not good at holding my breath while upside down under water. So, by the sixth minute of our training, I was swimming in the freezing water. My fellow kayakers helped me retrieve my boat and paddle. I climbed back into my kayak, cold, wet, and self-conscious. I was the worst kayaker there, and I was holding everyone up. And this was just the first day of a seven day trip. This was supposed to be the easy part.After two training days filled with a little success and a lot of failure, I lay next to the river beneath a bridge that symbolized the last bit of civilization we would see for five days. Reflecting on the two days of training, I counted fifteen total swims in six rapids with zero successful rolls. I felt the other kayakers, including our instructors, were pulling me along, and I was dragging them down. Quitting wasn\\'t really an option; I had to learn to deal with my constant failure. I had never been more frustrated or less successful with a physical task. I realized, however, that my frustration and self-anger were not helping the situation. Over the next couple of days I focused on turning my flips and failures into enjoyable experiences. I started to relax, be in the moment, and have fun with it. Our instructor, J.R., along with my uncle, dad, and the others on the trip, helped to make it fun by introducing little games throughout our time on the river. Once I adopted the mindset of finding the fun in my challenge, things changed for the better. During the lunch break periods and evening down time, I continued to work with our main instructor, J.R., on my roll. It was difficult work, but we had fun with it. I hoped my hard work was paying off, but there was still no validation on the river. The other kayakers continued to offer me encouragement and reassurance, boosting my confidence. Finally, on the third day of the kayaking trip, my hard work paid off. As I headed down a difficult Class III rapid, I flipped. This time, however, when I tried my roll, I came all the way up. I felt exhilarated. I whooped with excitement, and my fellow boaters cheered. Success! Looking back at my time on the river, I learned that I relied on many things to work through my failure. I needed my determination and a persistent mindset. Without it I would\\'ve given up and no progress would\\'ve been made. However, I also realized that some challenges are too big for one person to handle. I needed the encouragement and instruction of my fellow kayakers to learn to roll. Perhaps most importantly, I learned to embrace the moment, conquer little challenges along the way, and find the fun in the experience.\"}, {\"index\": 372, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I\\'m an accidental cheerleader.

However, I am incredibly nervous. This time is different than my past experiences. A despicable combination of doubtfulness and fear of change trembles in my stomach.After constant battles with my thoughts, I had chosen to spend my last summer in high school at my childhood happy place: Camp -------, a sleepaway camp in rural Pennsylvania. It was too soon to leave the place that has played a significant role in my development. Nevertheless, I began focusing on other opportunities available for the summer, forgetting how much camp means to me as a second home. My choices for the summer were to either continue science research at school by finding a research mentor with a professional science laboratory, or assume a new role at camp. Perhaps this summer could lead the path to my future career, but here I was\\\\u2014going back to summer camp. I was beginning to regret my decision.Heading up that camp hill, I didn\\'t know what to expect. I knew the transition from camper for nine years to counselor would be difficult. Supervising over a dozen nine-year-old boys in the blazing heat while focusing on the prospects I passed up would be extremely difficult. To make the most out of my summer, I needed to convince myself I made the right choice.By the time the week of counselor orientation was over, my trepidation was a thing of the past. The first bus arrived, and as the eager campers jumped onto the ground, I couldn\\'t help but smile. I flashback to my first year, seeing myself bound off the bus towards thirty or so \\'giants\\' cheering and waving their hands in the air for me\\\\u2014a pivotal feeling. Instantly, I recognize how monumental my job is. I never realized my counselors made an inordinate impact on my summers until I was in their place.On the last day of camp, I created individual cards for my campers that showcased their positive characteristics and development over the summer. I used this to inspire them to be themselves\\\\u2014something I learned from my own counselors. I hid the cards in their bags, and one boy discovered his before leaving on his bus. The smile on his face after reading it was astounding. He ran to me, thanking me for everything as he reached up for a hug. At this moment, I discovered how much I grew in a matter of seven weeks. I now highly value the power of making an impact on others.The drive down the hill after seven metamorphosing weeks epitomized my new outlook on life. I had never imagined how demanding\\\\u2014but rewarding\\\\u2014it could be as a counselor in charge of rambunctious campers. Given my gratitude for all the counselors who worked tirelessly through my growing years as a camper, I had paid it forward. While I initially derided my decision to come back to camp, I discovered that I can learn the most where I expect it the least.This hill--what seemed as a blockade for a great opportunity to start my scientific career--ironically became my path to become an engineer. My camp counselor experience exposed my underlying desire to stimulate change and advancement in someone\\'s life. I used past experiences and moral knowledge to solve problems quickly and creatively throughout the summer. This was my first step in making an impact, and now I have ample room to grow and direct this motivation towards society. As a scientist, I will be committed to innovation, creativity, and of course, perseverance.Ultimately, any personal circumstance is your drawing board for creation.

I was going to die. So I did the only thing that came to mind: I screamed.Pro tip: when you\\'re skidding rapidly towards a nasty lethal drop, there\\'s not much anybody else can do to help, even if you get their attention.Miraculously, I managed to hook my ankle on a nearby rock, halting my descent towards death.I fought to catch my breath as my heart threw itself against my ribcage. Everything had happened so quickly. One moment, I was hiking Cascade Pass with my family, and the next I slipped.I was fourteen. My own confidence in my immortality was shattered: life can end in a second, and I have to save myself.A decade earlier, at age four, I wrote a book about Ellen Allen, a mermaid princess who saved her dad from entrapment in a giant clam. It even had staples and marker illustrations. In elementary school, the magic of storytelling stole my heart. But my parents, computer engineers who had relied on welfare when they first immigrated to the United States, were concerned about financial security. From a pragmatic viewpoint, they weren\\'t sure about the value of creative writing. Afraid to disappoint them, I hid my work and told everyone I wanted to be a scientist when I grew up.In seventh grade, I would sneak onto my laptop at three a.m. to write anime fanfiction online. When, in ninth grade, a copy of my self-published novel arrived, I told my curious parents that it was \\'nothing.\\'\\'But your name is on the front cover...\\'\\'Probably a coincidence.\\'\\'Did you write a book?\\'\\'I don\\'t know. Bye!\\' I retreated to the safety of my bedroom before I could get barraged with any more risky questions. I\\'d known about the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards for years, but never had the courage to submit. After my experience on the mountain, however, I decided now or never. \\'You want to go to the post office?\\' My mother was skeptical. \\'Isn\\'t the American Mathematics Competition in a month? Shouldn\\'t you be studying?\\' Finally she agreed, and I sent out a manila envelope stuffed with three short stories. If you don\\'t get recognized, you can keep writing, I thought. It\\'s just a contest.The day regional results came out, Mom approached me with trepidation. \\'It\\'s okay if you didn\\'t win anything...\\'I had won two Gold Keys, allowing me to proceed to the national level of judging. Eventually, I won a national medal for one of my stories. Later, I found out the same story had been chosen for The Best Teen Writing of 2014, an anthology composed of the best national-medal-winning pieces.The next year, I forced myself to put my writing out there. I didn\\'t win every single contest, far from it. Rejection hurt, but each time I had to push through and keep trying. In April of my junior year, I performed at a citywide slam poetry competition in front of hundreds.To foster passion in others, I founded Glass Kite Anthology Summer Writing Studio, an online creative writing mentorship program for middle/high school students. I began it to help more kids cultivate their craft; I would\\'ve loved participating in a similar program when I was younger. This year, one of my mentees, Smriti, told me that she was especially excited because she lives in India, where there aren\\'t many opportunities for young writers. It\\'s been over two years since that day on the mountain. Now, I\\'m a youth poet ambassador for my city, but the point isn\\'t my accomplishments or awards. Most importantly, I learned that life was too short to be afraid. \"}, {\"index\": 375, \"new_personal_statement\": \"My Indian heritage teaches me to honor books as I would God, but seeing my Western friends use piled-up encyclopedias as makeshift ladders causes me to question this cultural peculiarity. Growing up in the Middle East has somewhat conditioned me to accept the non-existence of free speech, but when my grandparents narrate stories of Gandhi\\'s civil disobedience in British India, I cannot help but be enticed towards subversion. After countless turbulent nights of introspection, I have concluded that the same disunities that have led me to question my identity have also helped shape it.The constant exposure I have had to different cultures has inevitably led to comparison. Since my own \\'heritage\\' is in such a grey area, I view even the most mundane cultural idiosyncrasies with circumspection. Why is tea the hallmark of British culture when it is not even grown there? If we Indians value mannersso much, why is drawing pictures of Hindu deities on walls the only way to stop people spitting on them? This constant fracas with my identity has modified my mind to start asking questions of everything. It is this innate curiosity and affinity to argument that drew me to debating in the first place. Today I can confidently say that, if nothing else, I identify as a debater.When I was selected for the Bahrain National Debate Team in the World Championships, I felt oddly at home in a hall filled with over fifty different nationalities. Some described it as a confusing clash of cultures; it was very familiar to me. Unlike my teammates, I was seething with excitement at the prospect of debating Team Israel, in spite of the infamous ethno-religious conflict that defines our region. What greater privilege than witnessing a confrontation of ideology, somewhat akin to my own, in the form of competitive debate?Once the moment arrived, I was amazed to see a synergy rise from the ashes of political divide. We created a heated intellectual debate, without the slightest hint of disdain. The supposed antagonism which might have arisen never did; rather our differences helped push ahead the discourse. Through structured argument, we reached an unlikely harmony by respecting each other\\'s opinions.The debate with Israel was a watershed moment in my life. Before it, I had considered my internal conflict to be the bane of my existence. Afterwards, I concluded it was a boon. I decided that rather than distressing over which part of my upbringing is \\'right\\', I can accept that they are all equally valid depending on perspective. Today, I combine all of my cultural influences to create my own, unique heritage. In spite of never having lived in India, I watch TV shows about state elections as if I\\'m voting. I supported England at the soccer World Cup, yet silently smiled to myself when Bahrain emerged with a gold medal at Rio 2016. My disposition to question the norm has helped me throughout this process. Why must I subscribe to a black-or-white identity, if I agree with different parts of each influence? If debating Team Israel has taught me anything, it is that no barrier can be broken down without challenging preconceived notions, and harnessing differences to enrich our world view.Surprisingly, the dichotomies I have grown up with have turned me into an open-minded individual. The invaluable lessons learned from debating have in large part facilitated this. In today\\'s hostile political climate, where divisiveness is fostered by either side of the spectrum, my personal tussles will help build bridges between opposing sides of any dissension. As I enter college, it will not be my test scores that discern me from my classmates, but it will be my compulsive need to question ideas and provoke fearless inquiry with childlike enthusiasm. Sometimes, my argument will be refuted; but this is not failure: victory lies in the creation of debate, not the end result.\"}, {\"index\": 376, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Alex is an integral part of my life.

Instead it gives me the capacity to fully appreciate humanity by highlighting specific war generals and precisely envisioning how each individual has played a specific role within history. Ironically, by reciting facts I have grown to understand how simple tidbits of information are used in more complex trains of thought.This love of exploration ultimately is driven because I find facts to be interesting and I appreciate learning.

A predominantly Hispanic parish, Providence found it difficult to attract new parishioners as it resisted gentrification in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago.However, this was more than a church to me: it was a home. I was baptized here, I grew up here, my parents and grandparents were all married here. I knew it was going to be an uphill battle, so I did everything I could to help; this included activities such as reading at Sunday masses, volunteering at coat drives, and serving free meals to the homeless every Thanksgiving. Most importantly, I started teaching a Sunday school class of kindergarteners.These children were not born with a silver spoon in their mouths. Some of their parents simply sent their kids to Sunday school to take a break from them or run errands. Yes, some of them had attention spans shorter than the crayons they used, and I occasionally had to duck from a booger being flung across the table. However, regardless of their backgrounds or obstacles, I cared for these kids. I think I saw a little bit of myself in these children: young, na\\\\u00efve, Hispanic boys and girls with eyes filled with passion and hearts filled with hope. I\\'m glad that I spent all that time helping at Providence. It is still open to this day, and seeing that my efforts were able to positively impact my community was truly priceless.

It\\'s high school, so that means reading thick textbooks, going to the big game, and of course, bullying. I\\'ll be the first to admit, my biggest fear was becoming the outsider.I did not want to be the kid that no one talked to. So when I saw my own classmates getting bullied, I did not speak up. I watched. I became the oppressor instead of the role model and advocate that I strive to be. I knew I had to do something. I reached out individually to those who were bullied. I decided to throw a pizza party for them at my house. For most of them, it was the only party they\\'ve been invited to. It was truly an eye-opening experience; I gained immense respect for them after talking- but more importantly listening- to them. When I returned to school, there was no dramatic fight scene where I stood and fought every bully single-handedly. However, there was a change in the demeanor of those I invited; they could care less about what a bully said, because they knew somebody had their back. I have been a witness to issues such as bullying and poverty. I have seen these things for a reason: to do something about them. If you build a lighthouse, you expect it to shine light to benefit those who need it. In the same way, I have an obligation to use my talents in order to benefit those who need them. I have an obligation to Pablo and Kayla and the rest of the kids that I teach. I have an obligation to the oppressed who are looking for someone who will speak and fight for them. I am not afraid to shine my light on others. I realize that I alone cannot change the world, but I also know that big changes often start with small actions.

Initially attracted by the study of the intricate relationships between man-made and natural spaces, I have since grown to love Geography for its ability to interrogate complex issues troubling societies, while presenting a rich diorama of our world\\'s complex sociopolitical and environmental dynamics. As an A Level Geography student, I have often appreciated the practical applications of geographical theory, particularly when I researched ways to encourage cycling among cycling-averse The year I was born, 1998,Cowboy Bebop was released. It was a highly acclaimed show that won several creative awards, becoming widely hailed as a masterpiece among Japanese animations\\\\u2014 and also a subtle, nuanced work that dealt with difficult questions about existentialism and human loneliness. I knew none of that, however, when I first sat down as an unsuspecting girl of eight to watch its first episode with my sister. The result: a simple show about a group of futuristic bounty hunters was stealing my heart before I knew it, and transforming itself into a lasting centrepiece of my childhood.You might start thinking, \\'Where were our parents?\\' once you realise how age-inappropriateCowboy Bebop was for me. It depicted generous amounts of violence, death, and hedonism. Still, I wasn\\'t one to let some superficial grittiness deter me from being immersed in a show that was meaningful and educational. With every 40-minute instalment, I was voyaging together with the Bebop through a sublime and immense outer space. I simply became more and more absorbed by the spectacular splashes of colour and dynamism that would unfold before me, as the space cowboys outmanoeuvred notorious criminals in the Milky Way. And my favourite part, always, would be the conclusion of each episode withCowboy Bebop\\'s triumphant (if melancholic) ending theme,The Real Folk Blues.Truthfully, I remember few of the show\\'s specifics today; I can\\'t tell you what happens in Episode 18, nor certain plot details like why a Welsh Corgi also travels on the spaceship. I first watched it ten years ago, after all. But its messages about hope and the human condition have always remained with me. A wave of heartache still fills me when I ponder Julia\\'s psychological motivation for betraying Spike, or the sheer impossibility of Jet\\'s attempts to atone for his crimes.Despite its comedic elements,Cowboy Bebop is at its core very much a show about human failure: the failure to find happiness, to redeem oneself, and to return to a better age. But it is this paradoxical optimism and ambivalence pervadingCowboy Bebop that keeps me coming back no matter my age. Just as characters like Faye, Spike and Jet face a central struggle with loneliness in their lives as galactic exiles, I too question my purpose in the vast universe and how to overcome my own limitations in my moments of introspection.Within its melancholic depictions of human pain,Cowboy Bebop has produced one central, hopeful message about humans: that we can find our own meaning in life, despite the fundamental absence of clear answers in our postmodern world. When I began recognising life\\'s intricacies and tribulations\\\\u2014 how the security of childhood was an illusion, how much sadness other people had to endure\\\\u2014this message drove me to accept them as a natural part of life and forge my own meaning out of it. It was this belief accompanied Jet through his guilt, motivated Faye in her daring quest to reclaim her identity, and propelled me to persevere through my personal failures.Because ofBebop, I know not to fear the complexity of life, but embrace it. In life\\'s unforgiving uphill crawl, against insurmountable roadblocks, I don\\'t have to become hopeless; I can create my own oasis even in life\\'s inherently meaningless desert, and keep learning, and keep thriving. The value of life lies simply with the audacity to continue, despite the perceived absurdity or futility of it. WatchingCowboy Bebop was a turning point where I realised that life wasn\\'t beautiful or idyllic, unlike the romanticised and glossy images upon TV shows, but that that was no reason not to seize it.Day after day, year after year\\\\u2014 no matter what, that is why I will trudge on against life\\'s sandstorm.

Not only that, I became a champion skater as early as I was seven, and after that, I won many medals in various local level skating competitions. Since skating was my talent, I practiced it hard every day. It was going all great until the moment where a skill gets into a vulnerable zone known as complacency. All of a sudden, my love for skating started dwindling; I began drawing the line of my prospective graph downwards. As my love for complacency grew, I rarely practiced hard enough. Unaware fully that my talent was diminishing, I kept wasting longer period in other activities.A couple of years later, I got an opportunity to participate in the state level trials. On the day of competition where it was a full house, I was getting vibes of nervousness. Since I was out of practice for a long time, I could feel it a little more. The referee called my name and told me to start whenever I was ready. As I was about to start, I felt as if something locked my knees. And within seconds, I began to feel a wave of nervousness passing all over my body and my legs were failing to coordinate in putting up an attempt. Now I was in a moment of complete absurdity and without composing myself correctly, I tried pulling this one off with a significant momentum, and I flipped badly on my face. Dumbfounded at what just happened, I quickly got up again with a commitment to put up my second best attempt correctly. But as I managed to stand up for the round, the wheels of both my skates somehow touched each other, and this time I fell much harder on my back than before. Imagine a scene where the spectators hear a loud thud after silence engulfed them a few minutes ago because of my previous fall. I was shattered, helpless and completely exposed. Everything lost in a quick moment, and I realized the need to do at least something, and that was completing the requisite rounds somehow which I did slowly but painfully.The same night, this failure made me introspect, and I concluded that few values like hard work, dedication, determination, responsibility, and goal orientation have no substitute. An achiever is the one who keeps working and improving on his/her skills. Failure shakes hands easy if you start believing that the skills in your armoury do not need to be sharpened anymore. The values learned from this fall, I have been practicing them in whatever work I undertake, be it small or substantial. I see myself multitasking in day to day activities without getting baffled for instance when I work hard for communities working for a social cause, taking a lead role in organizing quizzes, or while practicing the game of handball (the second sport I loved after skating). My commitments not only have shown me a goal oriented path always but also, made me win the laurels of becoming the state champion in handball. For any project in life now, I design my goal, make a plan, and build a matrix of hard work, dedication, and diligence to achieve the potential results. My motto has become, \\'for any fall, recognize the mistake, work on the weakness, and stand tall.\\' I have always wanted to help people when I saw them suffering, staying in a gurudwara near the PGI hospital. where they had no place to stay and were not getting adequate treatment. From then, I always wondered if I could ever turn my ideas to something meaningful that could have a significant impact in tackling this problem, until I learned about UC Berkeley\\'s MET program. I could see a straight path to achieve my long-term mission of revolutionising the healthcare industry to make it accessible to everyone and anyone, fight death and reduce preventable deaths with the help of internet and technology. The MET program in a whole would help me in understanding and exploring the potential of eHealth, mHealth, Virtual Hospitals, Wearable tech and Remote Patient Monitoring and develop my skills in creating a sustainable and scalable platform to tackle the problems. The Berkeley\\'s ecosystem and the MET course will help me in developing my CS and engineering skills as well as give me robust understanding of economics, Marketing and AccountingThe MET program will not only engage me in courses taught by the leading faculty of Berkeley Engineering College and Haas Business School but will also open doors for immense leadership and development opportunity.

But an advanced science textbook (let alone one about Quantum Physics), well, that was new territory entirely.Attempting to link the abstract with the tangible, I connected String Theory (an impossibly complex approach to quantifying the universe), with my life (a slightly less complex\\\\u2014slightly more hormonal\\\\u2014piece of that universe). After taking apart the fragments of my life and stitching together remnants of my past, I found something quite profound: the book was right. My life is in fact made out of strings.String 1.A bright neon yellow cord whips through the air, wrapping itself around the spinning object as I gracefully maneuver through my routine. Out of the corner of my eye I see the crowd, a roaring mass of over three hundred fellow yoyoers, heads bobbing with anticipation, their inquisitive eyes watching my every movement. I had spent months preparing for this crowd, for the judges, for my three minutes in the spotlight. The National Yoyo Contest. I had to focus.Concentrating on my performance, my mind drifted back to the hundreds of worn-down strings, the dozens of string-burns scarring my fingers, the years of daily practice in pursuit of constructing the perfect freestyle.That moment made it all worth it. Passion flowed through me as I bounded through my routine, the audience growing in excitement at the perfect execution of each new trick. I developed a burgeoning intimacy with my spectators as I shared my creative passion, my persistence, my individual view on what a yoyo can do.In that moment and forever after, I became an artist, painting a performance with nothing more than a piece of thread. String 2.\\'Come back!\\' I shouted, chasing after a girl chasing her own shadow. Finally catching up, I coaxed her back onto the court, marvelling at her unwillingness to be taught. Every coach has their trouble student, but I have to say, mine was more troubling than most. \\'Ten more balls, then we\\'re done. I promise.\\' Glancing off to her parents, both enthusiastically smiling, she proceeded to hit the first ball perfectly\\\\u2026 and the second\\\\u2026 and the third. Ten perfect shots later, I prepared myself for the usual game of unwilling tag. Surprisingly, she stayed until the end of the lesson, and even maintained full eye contact when thanking me (another skill we had been practicing).The weeks following this breakthrough, I saw a different girl: one inspired by her own ability, one who wouldn\\'t let autism hinder her success. I grew up with tennis, passion steadily emanating from the vibrating strings of my racquet. I never knew I could feel the same passion from the strings of another.String 3.Music swirled through the air, the fusion of melodies animating my house with the warmth of human expression. My sister excitedly plucked the strings of her guitar as my voice energetically trailed behind. I chuckled at the thought of what we sounded like to an outside listener. Having started only months prior, our musical talents were\\\\u2026 lacking. I couldn\\'t care less. I heard only pure, unbridled joy as our aspiration for musical expertise entwined in uncontained artistic enthusiasm. My String Theory.From Yoyo strings to tennis strings, from my vocal chords to the bindings of my books; my life has been threaded together by every definition of the word. I am a bookworm, an artist, a teacher, a musician. I am a string, each strand of my existence perfectly resonating with my passions, pursuits, and ambitions.From the strings the universe has presented me with, I have created my own universe, my own String Theory.Oh, and I LOVE String cheese.\"}, {\"index\": 383, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 384, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 385, \"new_personal_statement\": \"To be updated later.\"}, {\"index\": 386, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Past the tumbling hills and serene fields and through the big bay window lies my sanctuary; the bright yellow colonial farmhouse I call home. A number of summers ago however, it also served as my prison.The summer had just begun when I clumsily mounted a pony for the first time at a birthday party and, like an unbalanced sack of potatoes, unexpectedly tumbled off. Desperately hungry for some cake, my resulting broken wrist was revealed only after a thorough and contested examination.This, and two preceding wrist fractures led my protective mother to order me to safe quarantine. For an active six year old easily bored by sedentary activity, even just this thought was overwhelmingly claustrophobic. I was trapped.I soon discovered however, there was far more to be seen through the transparent glass of the bay window\\\\u2014there were birds. Utterly entranced by their behavior, I finally made use of the binocular set my grandmother bought for my birthday the year prior, which, at the time, I found no less disappointing than a pair of socks or a bright knit sweater.Hours of observation revealed the birds\\' inherent inefficiencies. After short bursts of flight, they had to rest. My six year old mind reasoned that if man could alleviate their inefficiencies with planes, trains, and automobiles, I could solve the great dilemma facing the birds. I soon filled my time and my notebook with crayon sketches of possible solutions.My big idea? A flying birdhouse. As a six year old, I convinced myself this important issue needed to be remedied.After destroying numerous toy trucks in an attempt to harvest electric motors and circuitry, I built a mishmash of basic electronics that slightly resembled a play hovercraft. My design, however, was innately flawed. Much to my disappointment, birds refused to accept a ride.The memory of the flying birdhouse didn\\'t resurface until I once again found myself staring out the big bay window.I came to a fundamental revelation. I\\'m not a bird. While the birds had no use for a flying bird house, I needed one.Instead of aimlessly flying from place to place, jumping from activity to activity, I needed something to apply my learning to the real world.Meanwhile, the series of composition books that started with the flying bird house sketches filled with ideas of increasing complexity and practicality. I was patent pending at the time, on a buckminsterfullerene filter to slow the spread of infectious metastasizing cells. So I knew that engineering and inventing was my thing, but I still wanted to share this passion, my \\'birdhouse\\', with others.The years of inventing culminated with the creation of a club called \\'The Minnow Tank\\' (yes the name is a play on the name \\'Shark Tank\\'), a student-run think tank where my friends and I can discuss, design, and create solutions to real world problems.Now, two years later, we\\'ve grown significantly, and are pursuing a number of promising ideas. Our mentor, a Ph.D scientist and chemistry teacher, is currently helping us develop an auxiliary relay system that works in conjunction with existing flight recorders (black boxes). Inspired by the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared without a trace in 2014, we believe our system could help recover planes\\' black boxes without much cost or regulatory hassle. Through networking, we\\'ve been able to set up meetings with Fortune 500 companies, including Honeywell\\'s aerospace division, and are patent pending. A lifelong interest in solving problems through invention and the founding of The Minnow Tank started out with the failed invention of the flying birdhouse and the realization that unlike a bird, I need to fly with direction and purpose. The Minnow Tank is the vehicle in which my classmates and I take a step back from our busy lives and apply our knowledge in a meaningful way. It\\'s our flying birdhouse.\"}, {\"index\": 387, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 388, \"new_personal_statement\": \"A quality that I possess, and one that I am proud of, is drive.

Her words slapped on my face. \\'Shame on you!\\' she said before walking away. It was a drowsy summer afternoon when my mother flung her hand at me at the gate of my elementary school. As she walked away, one of my classmates noted, \\'Wow, that was intense!\\' My humiliation was complete. That afternoon my mother was infuriated at my ranking of 28th out of 800 in the final, because I did better last time. Even in my hometown, where domestic violence was a prevailing style of education, the extent of my suffering was unusual. When I first entered elementary school, clues revealing my home life\\\\u2014the bruises\\\\u2014were eye-catching. Initially, everyone was shocked, and showed generous sympathy. Teachers asked me if I could focus in class, and classmates shared their latest comic books with me. To them, the violence was unequivocally appalling. However, my suffering gradually became hackneyed, and people\\'s sympathy and concern declined. Publicly slapped and beaten for ranking 28th, I tried my best not to shout or cry, yet a few times I couldn\\'t help letting out sound of sobbing, my failures to maintain minimum dignity provoked more elation than compassion. I prayed in my heart again and again, silently beseeching the crowd to walk away, but other than accumulating excitements their faces were void of response. My classmates, then in the sixth grade having befriended me for five years, just stood around and watched. After an extensive struggle, I tried to talk with my mother about my truest feelings and managed to rebuild our relationship by applying what I had learned from my American host family to our own family life. However, my exasperation never completely dissipated, the reversal of people\\'s attitudes haunted me even more than those terrible memories. I just didn\\'t understand: why did they change? Stumbled upon Hannah Arendt\\'s work on \\'the banality of evil\\', I began wondering if those who changed attitudes had ever pondered if domestic violence was wrong. I speculated that the initial sympathy was aroused by astonishments, and rather than being shocked at what was wrong, people were appalled by the unusual extent of the violence I suffered from. They were only shocked at what\\'s unusual.During a summer in Africa, I was struck that millions of girls were still suffering from the primordial practice of female genital mutilation (FGM). I approached people and explained the cruelty of FGM, hoping to inform them of the evil in Africa. My words had minimum effect, however, for none of them showed genuine sympathy. Rather, they were attracted by the novelty of this unheard ritual. As for the girls, they comforted me, \\'That\\'s Africa. Bad things happen all the time. FGM is just one more bad thing.\\' Once again, I am terrified by this kind of evil demonstrated in the absence of sound thinking and judgment. But I had never gotten used to violence; every new bruise hurt as much as the first. To the victims of FGM alike, pains persist every living moment.As I turned to examine myself, I realized how difficult it is to do no evil. I always want to be against evil, but have I ever been an audience of others\\' sufferings? To be against evil is not merely being against doing evil but also the banality of it. The heart-wrenching line, \\'Wow, that was intense!\\', left me incrementally, but the discomfort never did. It arises at every suffering I see, keeps my consciousness active, and prompts me to speak and act against evil. Maybe I cannot feed all those who are starving, cannot end every war, cannot alter even a word on numerous treaties, but I\\'ll always exercise my thinking and judgment and at least not side with evil. \"}, {\"index\": 392, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Please paste your personal statement essay below.

It\\'s my last lesson with my piano teacher before I play the piece in Carnegie Hall, so I feel my own self-imposed pressure now more than ever. There is no room for mistakes, no time to fix missing notes or broken phrases - but as I\\'m playing, I feel like I\\'m driving in a car, losing control of the steering wheel trying to avoid any cracks in the road. My fingers are frantically flying off the keys, and the music is getting faster, but sounding worse. My piano teacher, calm and quiet, takes my hands off the piano and tells me to stop. She\\'s not mad, but I\\'m frustrated, and I just want to go home. \\'Why do you rush?\\' she asks.She points to my music. \\'There, fourth page, third system. Pause there, for just a few seconds. Wait.\\'\\'Did you know,\\' she asks me, \\'that music is not about the notes you play, but the space in between them?\\' She reminds me to take my time, once more, and enjoy what I am playing. \\'Sometimes, my lovey, it\\'s the small moments in your music that people will remember for a lifetime.\\'Classical music is not a mural; it can\\'t be painted with broad strokes. It\\'s such a detailed discipline, requiring a deeper appreciation of music, down to the individual notes. It\\'s through my study of classical piano that I\\'ve gotten a greater appreciation for my own life, which I look on much like a musical piece. The first measure of this piece is me as a five year old girl, starting my musical journey by playing an Alicia Keys song by ear for my parents. This part introduces the main theme, echoing throughout the piece, that I am an expressive person with a passion for music. There are also several pages which develop on this theme; measures and measures of practice sessions, the air dry and tense as angry, dissonant chords bounce off the walls of my living room. Practice is a significant element in classical music, so this (admittedly, sometimes dull) part shows up over and over again, with two hours squeezed into the school day and five to six hours on weekends to make up for it. But in between these pages; perhaps in the fourth page, third system; there are single measures of a soft, warm afternoon, where I\\'m having tea with my mother. We\\'re sitting at the breakfast table next to the big window, where we can watch the blue jays hop under our neighbor\\'s shrubbery. It\\'s a quiet measure, but one on which I always pause long enough to enjoy. All of these measures lead to a climax, featuring the bright lights of the Weill Recital Hall, glowing on me, a sixteen year old girl, nailing my final arpeggio in my Chopin Ballade and finishing the recital with triumph, passion, and flair. I\\'m bowing to an ecstatic audience, including my family, who has listened to every measure of this figurative and literal piece of my life since it began. Does this mark the end of the piece? Is this the only climatic measure of my life? Absolutely not; unlike most of the classical repertoire I play, this is the only musical piece which is still being written. I can look forward to the rest of this magnum opus, and I can look back and appreciate, in great detail, these small moments in my life which make me the pianist and person I am today. These are just measures in a lifelong musical symphony, but the piano has taught me that it\\'s the small moments that I will remember for a lifetime - and the moments worth playing for. \"}, {\"index\": 395, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I\\'m standing.

Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?Three years ago, I applied to one of the top high schools in my country. When it came time to write my essays, I spent 150 hours writing them in the space of a single month. Out of many thousands of applicants, I was one of 200 selected for an interview on campus. Only about five students receive scholarships every year, and I needed one to enroll there.During the 24 hours just prior to my interview, I did not eat or sleep. I sat in front of my computer and read testimonials of people who had done these interviews. Finally, the moment arrived when I was called into a barren room with a chair, three couches and one windowpane. I sat on the chair as my interlocutors chatted amiably. They\\'d just finished their lunch break.At that moment I had a panic attack. In those days, when I\\'d have something important or when I\\'d encounter new experiences, I\\'d sometimes feel as though I couldn\\'t breathe. I just wanted to escape. My legs felt as if I\\'d swam continuously for two hours and just gotten out of the pool. In my head, I heard a bedlam of voices echoing incomprehensible nonsense. I imagined I was like a young Clark Kent who, full of incredible powers and able to hear the cries of every human being, was overwhelmed by the cacophony and unable to focus.Finishing their chitchat, the professors turned to me and asked how my day had been. I told them it had been great. Then they asked me about genetically modified organisms. I lowered my eyes, tried to identify an intelligent thought rattling around my brain, twiddled my thumbs, and said \\'umm\\' a few times.They smiled, asked some more questions, and began to laugh among themselves. I was completely lost. Outwardly, I laughed, hoping to lighten the mood. Inwardly, I thought: why is this happening to me?After a few minutes, several of my interviewers\\' shoulders slumped. They stopped trying to ask questions that would have drawn me out of myself, and instead began to produce formulaic queries from the application.When I received the rejection email, nineteen days later, I burst into tears and cried the whole night. I didn\\'t talk to anyone but close friends for two days. To my family, I spoke only a few words. I locked myself in my room, and only after one month and 131 episodes of the anime show, Naruto, did I discover sufficient insight to realize and adopt Rock Lee\\'s ninja way: \\'Work hard and never give up.\\' In retrospect, I\\'m grateful I had that experience. I learned three important things: everything shall pass, give your all without worrying about results, and Naruto is the best show ever. No, seriously, it is!These ideas have shaped who I am today. I still maintain scrupulous attention to details, as evident in my philosophy essays and science papers. But perfectionism no longer cripples me: when I dedicate myself towards a singular goal, I do not worry whether I will fail. I know that, win or lose, I grow from each experience. That is my \\'ninja way.\\'As for that young Clark Kent feeling, whenever it strikes me, I just take deep breaths, believe I can do it, and repeat the three things I learned that day. (Okay, not the third one.)When, two years later, I stood at the dais for a student council election in front of thousands of people, their eyes on me, I no longer felt intimidated. Mic check. Is my hair fine? Should I keep my hands on the side or on the podium? Don\\'t worry, this too shall pass, so give it your all. And I begin.I concluded my speech to thunderous applause. I was finally able to transform into my own ninja version of Superman.\"}, {\"index\": 398, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 399, \"new_personal_statement\": \"My best friend sealed his death sentence with a swift manipulation of his fingers. He thrusted his sign unnaturally at the camera with the confidence of Los Colonia Chiques- one of the oldest and most notorious gangs in all of greater Los Angeles. As I processed the image, my gaze wandered towards the faintly visible scar above his left elbow. The nostalgic smell of antiseptic wipes flooded my nose as I re imagined his six year old self wailing - his limp arm pierced with shards of loose gravel. He had faced the consequences of accepting one of my many dares: to jump off of a six foot wall. We were in hot pursuit of the local paletero whom we assigned the role of precious jewel thief - his twinkling bells signifying the prized content within his cart was near. The confines of our one room apartments would often dissolve into the crooked floor boards of a pirate ship, the great hall of Hogwarts, or a damp cave ridden with monsters. He\\'d listen carefully as I read to him - already formulating our next adventure based off the people in our stories with endless possibilities. When I moved away from the hometown that defined my childhood, I realized the people in Southside Oxnard already had their stories written for them. I watched my loved ones become trapped in a destructive cycle from the confines of my new stucco San Diego suburb. As I grew older, anger towards an unknown entity brewed inside of me. I wasn\\'t sure what exactly was trapping the people I loved, but it\\'s appearance in my life was frequent. I heard this entity in the crack of my grandfather\\'s voice as he described how the shots we heard from down the street had struck his son. The entity was present in the glaze of my Tio\\'s eyes as he explained how his high school best friend was brutally beaten to death by the police. The entity flashed across the faces of my new friends\\' parents in form of silent confusion and judgement as my 26 year old mother opened the door. \\'Yes,\\' I would exclaim, \\'she had me at 19!\\' Where we were from, my mother and my friends\\' mothers were the same: young, brown, and alone. I would come to recognize this look from White people very well. It was the look when they realized they have misinterpreted your blonde hair and sunburned cheeks and in that moment, have categorized you as \\'Other.\\'I came to realize that this concept of \\'otherness\\' transcends individual communities and bonds together the shared experiences of those living in barrios designed to repress us. I know now that it\\'s the invisible marionette threads of institutionalized racism that entangled my best friend - and the millions of other young people of color who are victims of a lack of opportunities. Each time I saw him the threads would coil tighter around him as his pants drooped, his rate of suspensions and petty criminal offenses spiked, and the look of acceptance of his fate settled in his expression. The idea that those I grew up with would become a statistic burned within me, and the frustration I felt towards the injustices I saw became irrevocable. I recognized the privilege that was granted to me by simply living in another zip code. It became evident that I wanted to pursue a career in human rights - defending the causes I believed in, and working towards a better human experience for those who do not possess the privilege I have. I know there is collective power in standing together to take action against the systems of oppression that work to silence the voices necessary to dismantle them. The further I progress, the more I am reminded of where I am from - and what I have to fight for.I apathetically watched my mother\\'s face twist first in horror, and then pain as she processed that I had just told her I wanted to kill myself. At the start of my 8th grade year, my mother and stepfather separated after nine years. What I perceived to be the demise of my family was ultimately the catalyst for the development of my severe depression and anxiety.My anxiety was visualized in the raw patches of skin where my eyebrows and eyelashes had once been. Trichotillomania ,an obsessive compulsive disorder in which I would relieve anxiety through pulling out my own hair, had shattered my already fragile teenage self confidence. Each day I would fill in my eyebrows and apply a fresh coat of drugstore concealer to cover the notches I had carved into my wrist before dinner, but my mom never seemed to notice as we clashed instantly. Although I had pleaded with her not to send me to a hospital, she had insisted I began attending weekly therapy. I was naively convinced that my therapist, God, or anyone really would give me the instant cure for my mental illnesses. As I wallowed in the self pity that followed months of fruitless treatment, I came to the conclusion that I was the only one capable of leading myself to recovery.  In the summer before my freshman year of high school, the motivation to simply feel better gradually became my main priority. Chest crushing feelings of anxiety were combatted with long runs around the block, and the worn notebooks I brimmed with self reflection were often the only way to cope with the overpowering urge to self harm. Taking responsibility for my recovery was in no way the easy process I had hoped for, but is one that I wouldn\\'t trade for anything. Healing and becoming more gentle with myself is a continual process, and has allowed me to recognize my strength. Knowing I\\'m solely capable of saving my own life has led me to strive for constant growth - both academically and personally.

From lectures on philosophy taught by senior boys who didn\\'t know how to explain themselves, to speaking drills where I was told to stand on a desk and yell, I somehow embraced debate, learning quickly what I loved and wanted to know, like rhetorical skills and philosophy. Of course, in the weeks approaching Georgia\\'s varsity state debate tournament, I was terrified, about as terrified as I had been all year, having stammered through rounds and stumbled to assert myself. To compensate for my fear, I spent hours preparing, perfecting my cases and debating the varsity members at school. Yet, there was one person I left out. He placed at national tournaments and wrote strange cases using philosophers like Nietzsche and Agamben. The last thing I wanted to do was debate him, and I was bent on avoiding it.However, the day came when a crudely written contract was placed in front of me. The distinctly male handwriting on purple printer paper made me promise that next practice I would debate this boy as he used a case called the \\'Seaworld Aff.\\' It was an affirmative case he had written for \\'fun,\\' in which he argued that dolphins were moral agents who could make individual moral decisions, and developing countries should, as the topic stated, \\'prioritize environmental protection over resource extraction\\' in order to save their lives.I had no choice. I wanted to do as the older students who had coached me asked, but I also didn\\'t want to delink Koorsgaard\\'s justification for moral agents from evidence that showed that dolphins fit all the criteria.Two days later, I found myself in a room with the two senior boys in my debate event, as they patiently awaited my cross-examination questions. Embarrassed laughter escaped my mouth as I tried to think of what to ask. The two boys looked intently at me, seeming to wait for genius to escape my mouth. Instead, I asked, \\'what are dolphins?\\'I couldn\\'t get to my seat fast enough. Obviously I knew what dolphins were. I even understood why dolphins weren\\'t moral agents and why environmental protection in developing countries probably wouldn\\'t help save them. None of the questions that could get him to concede those points, however, could make their way from my brain to my mouth.In the couple minutes of preparation time I took, I collected my thoughts, jotting down everything that could disprove his case. I wrote quickly, intent now on having enough to fill my speech, to prove to both the boys and myself that I could debate.I stood up, looking nervously between the two boys as I began to speak, quietly at first, with doubt, until I began to gain conviction. In those seven minutes, I didn\\'t stutter or stumble over my words. I didn\\'t need to take the long pauses between thoughts. All the growth of my past year in debate felt like it was collapsing into a few short minutes in which I began to understand exactly what we were doing: learning and having fun. It was as simple as that, and I realized that I ought to treat it that way.Ultimately, I discovered that the scariest thing that I could do in debate was what I had just done. I went to varsity state and somehow lost my stammering voice, coming out confident and cool, even though I had doubted my abilities. I discovered that debate was mine for the taking. If I wanted to accomplish something, all I had to do was face those fears and insecurities that will always be prevalent. Most of all, I found my own voice to both ask and explain why.\"}, {\"index\": 404, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Freshman year, I was a new face in a new town desperately trying to find my place. Most my classmates had grown up together, and I was an outsider with a completely different background. I was uncomfortable and unhappy. To help me adapt, my mom encouraged me to join the ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) team, but I did not want to be in another superficial club. Reluctantly, I attended my first meeting. The upperclassmen were discussing the season\\'s designs as I walked in, debating hydrodynamics and electrical efficiency. They were so knowledgeable and inspiring. By the end of the meeting, my doubts subsided and I realized that building a functioning underwater robot was fascinating.I became a kid in a toy store eager to touch everything: use power tools, solder wires, and work the control system. Through endless hours in the workshop, I found a family in my teammates. They became my friends and guided me through high school, all while inspiring in me the engineer that I never realized existed. They taught me that small things in life are fun, that kindness is key, that hard work brings pride. I finally found a sense of comfort about how my high school years would eventually unfold.When the seniors graduated, the team lost years of accumulated knowledge. The brilliant minds of our chief programmer, chief mechanical engineer, gone. I lost my teachers and best friends. I felt alone. As the most experienced returning member, I was inevitably appointed team captain. However, with only two years under my belt, I was beyond intimidated. I would be responsible for teaching new members and implementing innovative ideas, but there was still so much to learn. I feared failure both at competition and in keeping the program alive after my own graduation. I questioned my ability to inspire.As daunting as it was, I faced the challenge head on. That summer, I focused on learning and preparing to recruit and rebuild. I read technical manuals, watched video tutorials, and evaluated our previous vehicles. I looked to industrial ROVs for comparison and realized that we should have had an open frame for better hydrodynamics, a center of gravity further below the center of buoyancy for stability, and payloads both simple and multi\\\\u2010functional. With these design principles and new team organization ideas, I anxiously awaited the start of the new school year.We gained twelve students that season. With our winning streak at stake and so few experienced members, I oversaw everything. The intense months preceding competition were spent in the workshop from after-school until late at night. As I encouraged input from all, we escaped the norm of previous designs, improving the ROV\\'s stability, maneuverability, and efficiency. Under my leadership, we successfully placed among the top ten and received an MVP Engineering Award at the international competition in St. John\\'s, Canada. Our diligence paid off.My unwavering determination has sustained and strengthened a program, built upon collaboration and inquisitiveness, that continues to change lives. Not only did I become a better person, but I gained confidence to tackle seemingly formidable tasks through constant self-discipline and meticulous organization. I now laugh at my initial hesitation to join. I have learned to not be afraid of new things, for some of the best memories and most valuable learning experiences come from them.Through our success, we have gained tremendous popularity and now boast over forty members. Returning members have gained so much experience that they now lead activities without my supervision. It excites me when underclassmen volunteer hours towards our success and come to me with unprovoked questions and ideas. I am humbled by the fire I see in their eyes, as I know that my impact on their lives is but a transfer of the one the upperclassmen and program had on me. In them, I see myself \\\\u2010 full of undying passion, enthusiasm, and curiosity.\"}, {\"index\": 405, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'If you see it there, darling, then it\\'s there.\\' This quote was Freddie Mercury\\'s response to fans continually trying to analyze his music.

Alone in my room, the peace that came with my silent drawing was an escape froma challenging home life.I was born to Polish immigrant parents. My father began drinking heavily when I was very young and by the age ofsix, my parents separated and my father fled the United States. Quiet activities like drawing or reading comprisedmuch of my home life due my mother\\'s stress with coping with the devastation to our family. I was a compliant,well-mannered and very shy child. When I was eleven, a family friend suggested that I be provided positivementoring to help with my confidence and shyness. My mother found a local Boy Scout Troop and signed me up,neither of us knowing much about this American tradition.As trite as it sounds, Boy Scouts ended up having a profound impact on my sense of self and inner strength. It hasbeen a pivotal part of my life for the past seven years, guiding me through adolescence by providing direction andself-assurance. My troop quickly became my extended family. I was surrounded by supportive youth and adultmentors. I was constantly honing my leadership skills, receiving instruction and guidance and then teaching othersskills such as first-aid and shelter-building. I eventually headed my troop of 80 boys. As a result, I became moreand more confident in myself within a welcoming community.This sense of inner strength and community was the greatest on an eleven day backpacking trip to Philmont ScoutRanch in New Mexico. Our group was a brotherhood, linked in overcoming the struggles we faced. The trip wasnot easy. None of us could have done it alone - we had to work together. I believe this is a major part of growinginto adulthood, facing adversity and struggles with a positive and determined manner, but with help and mentoringalong the way. Today, we have been raised to be competitive and asking for help is largely taboo, seen as anadmittance to weakness. Backpacking through that historic land, with such camaraderie and fellowship, made merealize that needing help does not connote weakness, and is actually what brings us together.Those years in Boy Scouts resulted in my earning of the Eagle rank. The night I received the badge, I could nothelp but think what it represented. While it was surely a recognition of years of hard work, it was more of areminder that I had not been alone in the earning it. My Eagle ceremony represented my metamorphosis from aboy to young adult supported by my troop and leaders.For much of my teenage life, I can attribute my success and passion for what I do in school and out of school tothe mentoring and strength I received from Scouting. Some make fun of boy scouting as something archaic or toomale oriented, but I know that this organization was instrumental in my development.Even though I have had to deal with the absence of my father and the impact it has had on my life, myinvolvement in Boy Scouts showed me that there are always ways that I could cope with hardships andchallenges. On a larger level, my involvement in Boy Scouts and personal history, has impressed on me theprofound importance of having mentors, trusting adults, and finding inner strength. For all of us, finding outlets thatgive us self-empowerment is vital to internal growth and success in life. Scouting allowed me to transform from ashy little boy drawing alone in his room to a self-assured young adult who mentors other youth, performs in front ofcrowds, celebrates learning, and shares his artistic flair and intellect with the world.\"}, {\"index\": 407, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Personal Information\"}, {\"index\": 408, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'Life is not always a long quiet river\\' is the opening sentence of my mother\\'s last letter to my brother and me. This phrase from one of my family\\'s favorite French movies La Vie Est Un Long Fleuve Tranquille (Life Is A Long Quiet River) has stayed with me since my mother\\'s passing three years ago.I was born in Paris, and my childhood was idyllic. I traveled to see the landscapes Matisse and Van Gogh painted in the South of France; I spent weekends in the Louvre Museum; on weekends, I played tennis in the countryside. When I was nine, our family moved to London. I was excited and terrified, but easily embraced my new ideas and perspectives. My transition to adolescence was smooth.On an otherwise normal day, my parents asked me to come to the living room. I tried to recall what I had done recently that could explain this summoning. Had I gotten a bad grade? Had I been mean to my brother? As our family gathered on the couch, my mother said \\'I have cancer.\\' My blissful existence froze. The room started spinning. My hands grabbed the nearest pillow and I squeezed it, attempting to control my chaotic thoughts. Why me? I cannot deal with this! As I looked up in complete disbelief, my mother forced a weak smile. Her eyes seemed to communicate \\'it will be okay.\\'My mother quickly had to be hospitalized. The first time we visited her, I ran out of her room until I found an empty area near a window. I looked outside for a while and talked myself into going back in, for my mother and for myself. Eventually, I stood up, fists clenched, nails dug deep into my skin.After that, anytime we visited, I did my best to help. I massaged her hands, typed up her work e-mails, read novels aloud. We reminisced about our holidays on Corsican beaches and to Italian museums. Those moments were precious: I temporarily forgot where we were and ignored the overwhelming smell of death, and my mother got a glimpse of the adult I was starting to become.Two days after my joyless 14th birthday, six months after her diagnosis, my mother passed away. My brother, my grandmother and I were visiting the Mus\\\\u00e9e d\\'Orsay, when my father called. I did not need to hear his words to know what had happened. My grandmother\\'s expression twitched and she opened her arms to us. I could not cry. I could not scream. I just stood there dumbfounded, silently observing the other museum-goers eating, laughing, living.If my childhood had been a long, quiet river, my mother\\'s passing had hurled me over a seemingly endless waterfall.As the months went by, I realized I had to continue living. My brother and I needed each other to stay afloat; we were living through the same loss. I also had to show my father that we three could do it, and that it was okay if we kept accidentally setting four plates at dinner.What marked my transition from childhood to adulthood was my mother\\'s death. But after falling down that waterfall, I refused to let myself drown. My mother\\'s last letter ended with the phrase \\'Life is certainly not a long, quiet river, but the point of living is to find and enjoy beaches of happiness.\\' The first time I read the sentence, I was unable to consider ever being happy again. Now, even though I miss my mother daily, I understand what she meant. I have found many beaches of happiness in my friends, my passion for acting, and in the belief that my mother would be proud of me. Anytime I struggle with not seeing the end of a waterfall, I grab the letter sitting on my bedside table, and read it to remind myself of the truth it carries.\"}, {\"index\": 409, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 410, \"new_personal_statement\": \"My stand partner and I look out over the piazza \\\\u2013 somehow, it\\'s become even more packed since the last break between pieces. We glance at each other and smile nervously as our conductor announces the next song: \\'All I Ask of You.\\' My hands are sweating, and I have butterflies in my stomach as our conductor introduces us - me as the arranger, and both of us as the featured soloists. I take a deep breath, glance back at the orchestra, and begin.I\\'d like to say I was infatuated with cello from the moment my future conductor first played it at the fourth-grade introduction to the music program, but that\\'s not exactly what happened. The classic demonstration of the Jaws theme was lost on me, a ten-year-old who\\'d never seen Jaws and was terrified of sharks. Truthfully, the only reason I decided to enroll in orchestra (despite rumored early morning rehearsals, the horror!) was because my friend chose violin. After deciding on orchestra, cello was a simple choice: you don\\'t have to hold it up on your shoulder and you can\\'t stand up while playing. Instant winner. Of course, my flawless reasoning failed to account for how big cellos are, but no one\\'s perfect.In the seven years since then, I\\'ve learned a great deal about myself, music, and the perseverance music requires. Music can be frustrating, and music with my conductor can be especially frustrating. Sometimes music transforms from a form of stress relief into a cause of stress. Sometimes I just can\\'t seem to get a passage right, or I\\'m forced to choose between practicing and studying. As with any passion, moments of disillusionment are inevitable - but so are the moments that follow. There are always productive lessons, exhilarating performances, and moments of clarity that inevitably occur along the course of learning a piece to serve as those vital motivational reminders.Those little moments kept me going long enough to discover that perseverance can get you anywhere\\\\u2014undoubtedly the most important thing I\\'ve learned from music. The first time I achieved first chair was also the first time my conductor decided a retest was necessary. Needless to say, I was displeased, but I put more work into that retest than I\\'d ever put into anything. I kept my spot and learned in the process that if I truly set my mind to something, I can make almost anything happen. In retrospect, the retest wasn\\'t the only (or the first) event to teach me perseverance. The Achilles\\' heel of my decision \\\\u2013 dragging my cello to and from school every day \\\\u2013 taught me, albeit on a smaller scale, the dedication necessary to excel in music.Despite my competitive nature, especially in regard to seating, music has been an overwhelmingly unifying force for me. I\\'ve met all my closest friends through some form of music\\\\u2014including my German exchange partner. We were only matched because we both play cello, but we ended up forming what I am sure will be a lifelong bond over Lion King, among other things. I\\'ve met people from all over the country and world through music, and I\\'m still in touch with many of them regardless of how long ago we played together.A year and a half after the concert in Florence, I still vividly remember looking at the crowd and hearing their applause as I stood to bow. Looking back, it\\'s a perfect synthesis of the lessons I\\'ve learned from music. The opportunity to play as a soloist wasn\\'t handed to me \\\\u2013 I had to be persistent and self-motivated. Music was the force unifying the people that poured into the piazza to listen to us, and the memory of the concert as a whole is one of my greatest musical motivators. And, finally, carting around a cello during an Italian heat wave taught me exactly how heavy cellos are.\"}, {\"index\": 411, \"new_personal_statement\": \"On January 14th, in the winter of my sophomore year, Foster the People \\\\u2014 my favorite band \\\\u2014 released a single named \\'Coming of Age\\'. The lead singer later described how his time in the Czech Republic, my second home, influenced the song. I could never have foreseen the preternatural accuracy with which the song would narrate my life that year.Earlier that winter, just as the cold winds began to bear soft, delicate snowflakes, my father was diagnosed with cancer of the throat, which had metastasized to the lungs and neck. He soon grew frail, needing help to rise and walk, and soon wasn\\'t able to eat. They cut a hole in his stomach for a feeding tube. We begin existence with a tube attached to our belly, and it looked as if my father would leave me like that as well.Death is terrifying. The chemotherapy regimen was brutal, and his rapid deterioration weighed heavily on me. I didn\\'t think he\\'d live to see summer. I channeled the anxiety I felt into my schoolwork: it was my outlet. I\\'d always had an aptitude for learning, but it wasn\\'t until this moment that I made the connection between my love for science as manifested in my hobbies \\\\u2014 horticulture and fish (and shrimp) keeping \\\\u2014 with a love for theoretical science. I\\'d always liked my sciences classes, but now they were so much more. I lived chemistry; I had the paperwork to allow my Honors Chemistry teacher to accelerate me, and at one point I was taking tests in January that were meant for March. My classmates (I told no one about my father) rumored that I did it to feel superior, but in reality, science was my outlet, the only thing keeping me afloat.My mother made the decision to have me withdraw from my extracurricular activities; she worried that the possible stress they incurred (I was involved in management, athletics, and academics teams in my school\\'s JROTC program alongside school sponsored athletics) would be dangerously unhealthy at such a tumultuous time. I suspect she made the right call.I had to suspend participation in these activities rather abruptly; because I held central roles in many of these activities, this leave was sorely felt by the Colonel in charge of the JROTC program. While he was very compassionate about my experience with my father, I could sense that my leave jeopardized my future in those activities. Upon inquiry, the senior leadership confirmed my suspicions. JROTC, the program in which I had flourished, simply no longer was an option.Junior year, my father began recovering against the odds. Luckily for me, I had identified my true passion \\\\u2014 and hit the ground running. I doubled up on math and science classes my junior year, and began research the day I met the school\\'s Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science adviser. Some of my activities had new names, but the underlying interest was still there: JROTC Academic Excellence turned to Academic Games and managing the JROTC tutoring program turned to tutoring independently and working on a school-wide program. The only real change was science. I had time to make up for, but I was determined to make it work.My hard work got noticed \\\\u2014 I was somehow admitted to the Pennsylvania Governor\\'s School for the Sciences, an opportunity I had only dreamed of. My healthy father dropped me off for the camp, and, as I hugged him goodbye, my eyes turned glassy. I don\\'t often cry.The song\\'s upbeat instrumentals take me back to that dark time, even today.

The objects inside are what one would expect from a child with an overactive imagination and an abundance of free time; among other things, there was an eight page comic book of my pet hamster\\'s adventures as a crime-fighting superhero, a scrapbook of all the plants and animals in my backyard, and an empty space reserved for my imaginary friend, Robot Robert. I was the kid who pretended that the tiles on the kitchen floor were lava, and spent minutes carefully stepping on the cracks between the tiles so I didn\\'t get burnt. The area where I spent most of my creative energy was drawing. In third grade, I received my first sketchbook made with brown-faux leather and looped with black coils on the side. It was plain and unembellished, yet it captured my attention for months. I used it to build up Hogwarts, recreate battles from The Lord of the Rings, and doodle elementary-school renditions of my favorite comic book characters. Early on, I realized that all I needed was a sheet of paper, a pencil, and a set of 64-count Crayola crayons to make the ideas in my head come to life. To me, drawing was like making magic; it allowed me to create something out of nothing, and become the architect of my own personal universe. However, as I grew up, and transitioned form battling imaginary monsters in my sketches to battling acne and realities of high school, I was slightly disappointed to learn from my AP Physics class that it is impossible to create something out of nothing. In my fast-paced world filled with school deadlines, jobs, and an ever-mounting list of responsibilities, my life seemed to have lost some of its magic that seemed to be imbued in every new encounter I experienced as a child. Still, I sought to preserve that same creative, whimsical innocence we had when we were children, but some of us lost when we became adults. One constant from my childhood is that I still use my sketchbook as a hub for storing ideas, whether they\\'re realistic or completely impossible. One of my favorite things to do is look around my surroundings, and find ways to improve on an environment or object. In a sketch, I drew a blueprint for a lamp that gave directional light yet illuminated a large area of my bedroom, and used cardboard to make the final product. However, I soon realized that making a lamp was harder than it sounded; I had to design a shape that was both compact and allowed the bulb to give off enough light in one direction. Through the design process, I learned about product ergonomics and the heating points of different filaments, therefore finding the balance between form and function. Other ideas were slightly less successful; as a result of my Star Wars obsession, I drew the preliminary diagrams to turn my parents\\' Toyota into a hovercraft. Sadly, that idea didn\\'t come to fruition once I discovered I needed a generator the size of a refrigerator to power it. Through these encounters, my desire to create, experiment, and illustrate the craziest ideas in my head have led to incredible moments of self-discovery. In college, I\\'m not looking to contain my brain, but feed my insanity. For every new mistake, I\\'m going to learn. For every time I learn, I\\'m going to fall, and make more mistakes. Like a child learning to walk, the experience from my past are invaluable reminders of the lessons I\\'ve gained, and those I have yet to discover. However, I seek to approach the future with the same outlook I had as a child: wide eyed and like a sponge, absorbing every nugget of knowledge I can. After all, that box of \\'Childhood Memories\\' isn\\'t full just yet.\"}, {\"index\": 413, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I hear the beep of my timer signal the start of my first affirmative speech at the Harvard Debate Tournament: \\'I affirm the resolution: Just governments ought to require that employers pay a living wage.\\' As a child, I would have determined the moral worth of such an action based on its consistency with the Torah, the scripture I was taught to be the word of God; but as I begin my speech, I reflect on how my beliefs have changed.I was raised a Modern Orthodox Jew; I observed the sabbath, I kept kosher, and I lived in a Jewish neighborhood that was within walking distance to a synagogue so that my family would not have to break the sabbath to attend services. In my synagogue youth group, I was taught that morality came directly from God, that all ethical instruction could be derived from the Torah, and that the Jewish people were superior because God gave the Torah to us only. I na\\\\u00efvely believed that the Jews in my community would act with a high degree of morality by virtue of the fact that they were Jewish. It was not until my tight-knit community split into two that I came to believe that many of my religious beliefs were flawed.A small disagreement involving a few families and the rabbi evolved into a community-wide conflict in which everyone took sides. Half of the Jews in my neighborhood, including my family, refused to attend services at the community synagogue out of anger towards the rabbi. As the feud intensified, I began to witness daily,confounding occurrences: people on opposing sides of the conflict stopped talking to each other, some threatened to kill each other, and many of my friends were forbidden to play with me because their parents were angry that my parents \\'deserted\\' the synagogue. For someone who had been taught that Jewish people were superior, I was beyond disoriented with regard to my beliefs. How could Jewish people be morally superior if the Jews in my community were acting in ways that I knew to be immoral?This inconsistency caused me to increasingly question my religion. I became less content with the answers that Orthodox Judaism had to offer and wanted to study other religious perspectives. I scoured the Internet for information about the beginning of the universe, I explored different intellectuals\\' views on the nature of God, and I learned about atheism through the works of Bertrand Russell and Sam Harris. The more I researched, the more I believed that no one was morally superior simply because they belonged to a certain religion, and that it was futile to search for objective answers to the question of whether God existed. As my belief in God diminished, I stopped attending synagogue, observing the Sabbath, and keeping kosher. The question of where morality came from increasingly intrigued me\\\\u2014whereas I had previously believed that the source of moral intuition was God, I now believed thatmorality had to have come from elsewhere. Around this time, I began competing in Lincoln-Douglas debate, a form of debate that emphasized logic, ethics, and philosophy. I studied different ethical frameworks such as Utilitarianism and Deontology to justify my arguments, and I learned that philosophers such as Kant had proposed answers to ethical questions based on logic instead of an appeal to God. The questions that had been troubling me were beginning to be answered. My timer goes off, indicating the end of my speech, and my opponent begins to ask me questions about the ethical framework I presented to warrant my case: \\'You state that the word \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018ought\\' in the resolution implies a moral obligation, but what is the source of morality?\\' I confidently point to a paragraph and respond, \\'The Christine Korsgaard evidence argues that morality comes from within the individual and not from an external source like the government or God.\\'\"}, {\"index\": 414, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Personal Information\"}, {\"index\": 415, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Living life with slowly decaying vision, where simply nothing can be done as slowly all vision drains away, is a horrible fate. The vision disappears in phases: first distance, then night, detailed vision and so on. The blindness can be caused by retinitis pigmentosa (the degeneration of the rods in the eyes) and diabetic retinopathy (the hemorrhaging of the eyes), two dangerous diseases which lead to blindness, though in two different ways. One is genetic, while the other is caused by having diabetes for an extended period of time. Unfortunately, my grandmother has both, an unlucky convergence if there ever was one. She cannot see at all in dim lighting and can only marginally see better during the daytime. It makes her life a near impossibility: she cannot tell what is on the floor in front of her, she cannot see an object that is eight feet away, and she cannot tell the difference between my face and my dad\\'s face. For her, a device that would not only let her view objects, but also details in her environment, would be a godsend.The diseases not only represent a problem for my grandmother, but also for millions of people around the world. Building glasses or some other vision enhancing inventions would allow many of these people to live normal lives. For me, building such a device would also be in the best interests of my family. Retinitis pigmentosa is hereditary. Type 1 diabetes, the type my grandmother has, also has hereditary components. It is likely that one or both diseases may threaten the health of my father, my sister, or me.Wanting to help my grandmother, I tried to create a solution to the problem by attaching a camera to a screen to project an image in front of her eyes. Yet, because I did not have the technological or medical knowledge, the gadget unfortunately failed. Unknown to me was the true pathology of diabetic retinopathy - hemorrhaging in the blood vessels of the eyes, which caused a whole host of other problems, like black spots in the field of vision. Just enhancing an image will not help my grandmother see the full image because her field of vision is blocked. Regrettably, I did not have the knowledge to accomplish the task.Not having the insight to create a device that would help my grandmother was disheartening. It is rare that I cannot complete a goal, and now I have no idea how to even approach a new solution. Even with the help of the Internet, there are no resources available for me to unravel the problem. Yet, I feel that furthering my education would greatly improve my chances of accomplishing my goal. In the short term, if I cannot complete a goal, I simply put in concentrated effort to solve the problem, and often I reach my long-term goal. I will not be dissuaded by setbacks right now because this project matters a lot to not only my grandmother but my entire family as well. I will continue to push myself, researching and experimenting on new ideas and devices to solve this problem that incapacitates so many.

I stumble while sight reading and gasp for air in the middle of tied notes. My intonation is rarely accurate, and I can never detect a key change. Yet every day, my voice echoes throughout the church hall, the rooms of my home, and the school basement that we call a chorus room. I could have abandoned this hobby like I abandoned ballet at age five and soccer at age seven, accepting that it is simply \\'not for me.\\' But unlike these former pursuits, singing has not slipped out of my life. This is because I do not sing to hear the sound of my own voice or showcase my talent. I sing because it provides me the opportunity to fully express my emotions. The passion I exude while performing makes up for what I lack in technical ability, allowing me to engage the audience and connect with the singers around me.I am often encouraged to stifle my excitement and adopt a pleasantly indifferent attitude in everyday life. Once while dissecting a fetal pig in biology, I became exhilarated by the beauty of the internal structures. My unimpressed lab partner had to ask me to stop gesticulating because I would \\'hurt someone with that scalpel.\\' When I\\'m singing, however, I do not have to curb my passion. Emotionality is an essential aspect of my ability to communicate a story with my voice.As I stand on risers surrounded by forty talented girls singing \\'Music Down in My Soul,\\' my imperfect articulation and staggered breaths are not important. What is meaningful is my soulfulness. When I transform myself into a gospel singer, I create a synergy between myself, the singers around me, and the audience that allows us to feel linked with the music.With passion for what I do, singing is never an individual experience. When I sing, I use my emotional energy to interact with my fellow singers and provide them with joy. One day in chorus, our accompanist alerted us that our director would be absent for class. She posed an inquiry to the group: \\'Who would like to be a student conductor?\\' I was apprehensive at first. Surely, other girls with more technical knowledge would be better suited than I. After much prodding from my peers, I accepted my fate. I would conduct \\'Lux Aeterna,\\' a fairly serious and introspective Latin chant. I began with these descriptors in mind, but as soon as I began waving my hands over my head, my anxieties slipped away, and I lost myself in the music. I cued each section with a flourish, unapologetically singing the different voice parts as I went. To signal a crescendo, I leapt into the air, and to indicate quiet, I crouched down. I directed the chorus striding across the room in constant motion. In these moments, I experienced supreme bliss.My friends later told me that they had never enjoyed the song more. I had been a fantastic conductor, though I had frequently botched the tempo and missed cut-offs. My physical engagement with the music had made them feel invested in the song and had improved their performance. This was the best compliment that I could have ever received. It confirmed my belief that passion is more important than talent, because it is this passion that lifts others up.I have come to accept that half-heartedness isn\\'t in my nature. My life without enthusiasm and investment would be like a life without music \\\\u2014 and that isn\\'t a life I intend on living.\"}, {\"index\": 419, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The allure of dusty, old computer monitors was too intriguing to ignore. They looked as if they hadn\\'t been used in years, and the two boxy contraptions were amusing to me. Overcoming the urge to leave a musty lounge in the Byron Park retirement residence, where I was volunteering to haul away old furniture, I asked an elderly man if anyone ever uses these computers. \\'No,\\' he replied, \\'no one knows how to use them.\\' I began going back to the retirement residence every Saturday morning to teach the computer lessons to the seniors.It is hard to believe in this day and age, when technology envelops our lives and rules our every waking minute, that a generation of people do not know how to use computers, surf the Internet, or send and receive e-mail. Initially, I assumed that teaching seniors to use computers would be an easy task. With the plethora of resources to accommodate people with sight and hearing problems, showing seniors how to use computers would be an even simpler experiment. It turned out that this assumption could not have been more wrong.Most of the seniors I instructed had never even touched a computer before. What they saw on the screen was alien; even simple tasks such as logging in to an email account seemed beyond their grasp. The reticent attitude in which they approached the machines contributed to the obstacles. They had a strong conviction that computers were of little use to them. At first, my approach was to focus on the technical aspects of computers. By the end of the first few weeks, much to my chagrin, we accomplished very little. I was disgruntled by the fact that my three-year-old brother knew how to use the iPad instinctively. My task proved much more daunting. It was the mental hurdles, not the technical ones that I had to overcome.I changed course by putting more emphasis on how computers could be useful to their lives. Reading newspapers, staying in touch with loved ones, and managing their finances and medical prescriptions were just some of the benefits of computers. I also attempted to find ways to elucidate the points that I was trying to get across. Realizing that this was a completely different generation with dramatically different life experiences and learning styles, I began to use real life parallels to help with instruction. Analogies that likened email inboxes to mailboxes and web pages to magazine pages, yielded great results. Equating email passwords to car keys made these concepts far more comprehensible.These parallels broke through their instinctive reluctance to use new technology and they began to make tremendous progress, as I realized the distinction between knowledge and the ability to teach it. My frustration gave way to pride and joy as my experiences at the Byron Park retirement residence proved didactic to both the seniors and me.\"}, {\"index\": 420, \"new_personal_statement\": \"It didn\\'t take much to tear us apart.One phone call.

With five children in our home and ameasly food stamp budget, I quickly learned to become a chef and improvise meals, my favorite of which was thedelectable combination of ketchup and bread. Even as a child, adaptability was necessary.In foster care, my life became a whirlwind of uncertainty. The shortest time that I spent at a school was six days.The longest was one year. This constant migration between schools meant that I was always the \\'new kid\\' andmade making friends impossible. Without family or friends in my life, I latched onto education as a way to stayafloat in a tumultuous sea that constantly threatened to drag me under. If there was anything that I was certain of,it was that education could liberate me from the cemented shackles of poverty.Initially, I never foresaw a life beyond foster care. I planned on enduring the numbing pain of the system and agingout when I was eighteen. Even though my life was lonely and dispassionate, it was tolerable. After years as anunwanted child, I developed powerful defense mechanisms that rendered me nearly unemotional when faced withmisfortune.

When my fifteenth birthday came and left without a birthday caketo acknowledge my existence, I was wrecked. Stifling my sobs, I called my case worker and told her that I had hadenough.

Gone are the days when physical books banned from import or snatched from the classroom are passed from friend to friend. Still, I see myself making an impromptu appearance at a Wichita School Board meeting to defend my book, passing picketers demanding its removal from school library shelves.There are many reasons for this career aspiration.I like the variety of rebellious possibilities the banned books genre offers. I can try my hand at the juvenile (Captain Underpants), the scandalous (Fifty Shades of Grey), or the sublime (The Bluest Eye). I can even write about gay penguins. Gay penguins appear prominently on banned books lists. And Tango Makes Three, a picture book about gay penguins at the Central Park Zoo, topped the Most Commonly Banned Books list in 2006, 2007, and 2008, and made the decade top five. Banned books make easy reading lists for up-and-coming rebels, like a counter-cultural New York Times Best Seller List. That said, the fun of rebellion is not my sole motivation.Books that challenge deep beliefs \\\\u2014 especially those beliefs rooted in unexamined morality or the perpetuation of existing systems of power \\\\u2014 elicit strong responses. Reading, still one of the active solitary experiences left in our 140-character world, permits us to briefly inhabit the gut-wrenching desperation African Americans felt during slavery in Beloved by Toni Morrison or the helplessness that can drive destructive decisions in Cut by Patricia McCormack. I want readers to understand the lives of characters that are less commonly found in fiction. To me, wearing the banned book label screams, \\'I tell a new story that stretches the boundary of imagination.\\'When I write, I can fill voids in my understanding by telling untold stories. I have written about bullying and how it affects gay teens. I have written about teens who are depressed, abused, addicted to substances, or alone like Kate, the protagonist of my first novel, who writes her dead girlfriend back to life in an effort to cope with her death. Everyone\\'s story deserves to be heard, and stories about underrepresented experiences should be read.I go dumpster diving for characters. The ones I choose are filled with at least as many imperfections as redeeming qualities. Ingrid, a character in one of my current pieces, does not report the man who abuses her, and he then goes on to abuse her sister. Yet I would rather learn from Ingrid than banish her from my work. I gain new understandings of my characters despite our numerous and seemingly incompatible differences, and some of those understandings inform the way I relate to people in my actual life.Through my characters, I live other lives, imagine worlds that do not exist, and ask, \\'Why not?\\'As I reflect on my desire to push boundaries and not conform, I note the irony that I am conforming to what an artist is supposed to be. Should an artist stand in opposition to society and existing norms? Perhaps an artist could be exceptional at being conventional in some elegant or better way, or in reinforcing that which exists with great beauty.To me, art that lasts is art that challenges with foresight, new perspectives, or insight.

Found in a ragged Chinese textbook: \\'Facial masks are a significant part of Chinese performing arts. Each color signifies a different value. Black means neutrality. Red means courage. Purple means justice. You can determine a character\\'s personality from their mask.\\'When I was nine, I painted my own mask in Chinese school. Reflecting on my repeated usage of \\'I don\\'t really care,\\' passion for riding roller coasters, and firm belief that everyone should be treated equal, I made my mask with hints of purple and red hidden behind splashes of black.Growing up, my activities were common among most of my Chinese-American peers. With our mutual dislike for spending Sundays at Chinese school, being too advanced for the school math curriculum, and participation in the same music recitals, fitting into the norm comforted me.\\'I\\'m going to China for a few days to visit your father,\\' my mother blurted out one night as she booked a last- minute plane ticket to Beijing.When she came back, I learned that my parents were getting a divorce.

I made it my responsibility that night to console my mom throughout the divorce. While my family dissipated before me, I started wearing an imaginary mask to hide my feelings.I grew unaccustomed to exploring my heart and concealed my feelings by maintaining a happy-go-lucky reputation. Friendships, I believed, were based on similarities I shared with others. Hiding my differences behind a facade of neutrality reassured me that the nature of my friendships was stable while my family was not.To admit or not to admit. As a child, I repeatedly chose the latter.\\'What about your dad?\\' my friend would ask when I requested for a ride home after school.\\'Oh, he\\'s on a business trip.\\' Junior year.I was ecstatic to begin a new chapter at an early-college boarding school named TAMS. Living alongside more than 400 kids, the atmosphere encouraged us to share personal stories within months of meeting. Fall 2020 8 \\'My parents are divorced,\\' my friend confessed to me one day. Naturally, I responded with sympathy and actively listened to his troubles. This time, however, my friend was just like me. Not only did I have the chance to sympathize, but I could also demonstrate empathy without being alone in dealing with the emotions I masked in fourth grade anymore. To admit or not to admit. My second semester, I chose to admit. We bonded over the emotional complexities of growing up in a single-parent household: missing our fathers who inspired us but remaining grateful for our moms. We developed a close friendship: crying during times of trouble and failure, celebrating during times of success, giving each other advice on how to overcome difficulties, and growing as a result. In a place where no sense of home was present, the 400 of us constructed another one. For the first time, I was able to relinquish my guilt from my parents\\' divorce. At TAMS, I took off the mask I had worn for the past eight years. Yet, I remained the same optimistic girl.Senior year. As I packed for TAMS, I made sure to leave my old mask behind.Black means neutrality. Red means courage. Purple means justice. In the past, I hid behind a black mask. TAMS, however, granted me experiences that brought out the other colors in me, and I look forward to sharing them in a new home.To admit or not to admit.

Moments later, I successfully deciphered her question: How do you pronounce these words?Since I was two, my mother single-handedly balanced caring for and financially supporting me. To relieve her workload, my grandparents came from China to help cook and clean while I became the family mechanic. As we worked together to create a home, we quickly faced a generational and cultural barrier. My grandparents preferred pen and paper; I preferred keyboard and laptop. They used chopsticks; I used forks. I then took upon additional roles as their technology assistant and English tutor, answering any questions they had. How do I print? How do I use the washer? How do I connect to WiFi?After school, I would head to our family kitchen, where an unknown challenge awaited me every day. On Monday, I would be found underneath a kitchen cabinet, disconnecting and connecting tubes to fix the overflowing sink. Tuesday, I stood above the dining table, replacing burnt-out lightbulbs. Wednesday, I sat with my grandmother, teaching her how to import photos from her phone to her laptop. With each challenge came a valuable lesson.My grandmother grew up 57 years before me in China. Yet, the two of us managed to augment each other. One day, I was tasked to teach her social media and its basics. She then posted portraits she captured in America. Her continued pursuit of photography in a country where she knew virtually no one inspired me to follow my passions no matter what, a lesson that stuck with me years later when I became a female pursuing computer science.As the family mechanic-technology assistant-tutor, I successfully closed the gaps within our family. Now, my grandmother types English in her social media posts unassisted. My grandfather cooks meals using English-labeled kitchen appliances independently. My mother comes home to a tidy, functioning home after a long day at work, and I unrelentingly learn.Listen.From a young age, I was taught to obey, to accept everything I was given. As a child in a traditional Chinese family, these Confucianist values were passed from generation to generation, and I conformed to them. In first grade, my ten dollars went missing in a classmate\\'s hands. Rather than speaking up for myself, I remained silent, deciding this was my fate.Years later, I read about a group of students from Parkland that ignited a nationwide movement for gun control. They were my age. Yet, they were the complete opposite of me. They fearlessly demanded politicians to pass measures to ban automatic weapons. I feared kindly asking for my money back. They aimed to alter the rules for the better. I took no action.Motivated by my inner rebellious side and desire for safety, I yearned to join my peers in Parkland. I then attended my school\\'s walkout that several upperclassmen organized. I stood in the back, quietly chanting and listening to speeches about the need for tighter gun laws. I was fascinated by the influence my peers had on the crowd and dreamed of becoming like them. In the next two years, I paraded in front of Dallas City Hall, urging representatives to abolish a luxury tax on menstrual products. I became one of the only students at my STEM-focused school to enroll in Economics of Discrimination, where I study the racial, gender, and socioeconomic imbalances present in our economy. I pioneered camps in my area to expose more women to programming in the male-dominated field of computing.I am inspired by risk-taking, studying and following the steps of those who relentlessly challenge the status quo despite knowing the consequences. As a child, I believed it was intolerable to tackle issues set by those in control. In a reversal of roles, I now aim to encourage kids like me to stand their ground. Embracing my new mindset, I hope to rewrite my fate rather than accept it. Instead of staying silent about issues like unequal pay, I picture myself standing with others, persistently fighting for rights.I serve as a troop leader, a troop of middle school girl coders that is.

Once I got over my initial trepidation, I felt elated and sang my heart out. By the end of the performance, pride in my accomplishment had me beaming from ear to ear.Though I only started acting last year, musical theater rehearsals have quickly become another home for me. As a child, I often felt excluded by my peers. By the time I was three I\\'d taught myself to read, and I had difficulty communicating with friends because I was so much more linguistically advanced. In middle school, however, I found a place where I fit in when I joined a Lego Robotics club. I\\'d always been a strong student in math and science, but now I had friends who, like me, were interested in discussing intellectual topics. I loved solving problems and finding real-world applications for what I was learning in science class, so when I got to high school I was thrilled to join the Robotics Team.A veteran member of the Robotics Team, I\\'ve participated in many exciting competitions and am always eager to tackle the next problem that comes our way. Recently, I spent weeks working on a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model, striving to make it perfect. My hard work paid off, and the achievement reminded me that I excel when I devote myself to a project. On the Leadership Council of my school\\'s Student Diversity Board (SDB), I\\'m responsible for organizing and planning social events celebrating different aspects of campus diversity. As a black and bisexual student, it\\'s important to me that our school emphasize not only recognition but inclusion and celebration of diversity, which is why I\\'m so dedicated to this council. While my primary extracurricular activities have been Robotics and SDB, I recently discovered a love for theater, as well.Several of my friends participate in our school\\'s theater program, but I was always too nervous and self-conscious to audition myself. One day, while practicing with my friend before her audition, she asked me to be her partner at the actual auditions. That meant that I had to audition as well. I was terrified, but also loyal to my friend, so I knew I couldn\\'t back out. Trembling, I stood in front of the director and recited my lines. I didn\\'t think I had done very well, but when I saw my name posted on the cast list, my career in theater began. When I go to rehearsals now, I look forward to seeing my castmates and working together to become an ensemble. Like the Robotics Team, everyone is there for the same purpose. We all do our best to learn our parts and fulfill our functions to put on the best show possible.I get a thrill out of working with others and uniting with them in a common cause. I am naturally curious and inquisitive, and sharing intellectual exchanges with friends inspires me to take risks and embrace new experiences. I look forward to finding a place where I can connect with students from more diverse backgrounds, learning from their experiences and perspectives and working with them to solve problems. I know that I want to study science and engineering, but I\\'m also passionate about economics; I hope to find an environment where I can explore my diverse interests. Most importantly, I want to feel challenged intellectually and supported by a community dedicated to the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion.Learning is my passion. On top of the satisfaction that comes with gaining knowledge, I love the feeling of expanding my horizons and broadening my perspectives that accompanies exposure to different information, narratives, and perspectives. As such, I believe that the ideal educational setting for me is one that supports and emphasizes pursuit and development of self-realization through the accumulation of knowledge and experiences\\\\u2013\\\\u2013an environment with enough academic freedom and emphasis on intellectual engagement with peers that I would have ample room to grow personally and intellectually; an institution that allows and encourages the realization of the joy that comes with learning for learning\\'s sake. I readily acknowledge that, in the modern world, \\'employability\\' plays a role in choosing a course of study. However, I believe it is possible to address one\\'s comprehension and understanding of the surrounding world and the context within which one lives his or her life before specifically singling out and targeted such \\'practicality.\\' I believe that I would flourish in an environment that places an emphasis on the understanding of the world and oneself in addition to the tackling of larger issues and ideas, and that being able to take this approach would allow me to better prepare myself to engage with and become a citizen of the world by promoting the critical thought and contemplation needed to be more efficient, equitable, and effective in one\\'s thinking and decision-making. Such a measured approach strikes me not only as more pragmatic in the long run, but also as more intellectually and personally rewarding than one solely focused on pragmatism, as the former encourages learning across disciplines and delving into fascinating material without sacrificing the possibility of gaining full command of the breadth of understandings and thoughts that can garnered throughout one\\'s academic journey.As an LGBTQ student of color, diversity is particularly important to me. I would love to have a peer group whose constituents were more diverse not only in terms of race and sexuality, but also in terms of their origins\\\\u2013such as their beliefs, their socioeconomic background, the type of school they attended, and where in the country they call home. I also want to find an institution with more diversity of thought and interests across the board. My current institution places a great deal of emphasis on government, economics, and finance, and with debate, Model UN, the Student Investment Fund, and Institutes of Leadership and Government at the forefront of collegiate life, I strongly feel that I would benefit greatly from a more diverse student body, as such a setting would contain a more varied spread of perspectives and values from which to learn. Having a more diverse faculty and student body expands the number of narratives available to be explored inside and outside of the classroom, thus providing a less constrained sampling of the points of view through which the world, the self, and the relationship between the two can be contemplated. Although I am passionate about STEM education and intend to study the sciences in college, I am also passionate about exploring the intersections between science and design, fascinated by economics, and eager to take classes and engage with ideas in disciplines such as sociology, ethnic studies, and gender studies. Therefore, I feel that I need an institution with more equitable allocation of resources\\\\u2013\\\\u2013in which academic fields from the arts to the hard sciences are given fair recognition, weight, and representation\\\\u2013\\\\u2013in order to allow me to truly satisfy my interdisciplinary thirst for knowledge and self-improvement. With these resources at my disposal, I will further strive to develop closer working relationships with my professors and peers over my academic career, and fully intend to take advantage of research opportunities. An institution with more evenly distributed resources would not only facilitate my ability to accomplish these goals, but would also attract students with a similarly wide breadth of interests; such a student body would allow me to learn from and exchange ideas with peers whose ideas and passions differ greatly from my own, thus leading to a great deal more personal and intellectual growth than I could hope to amass in a less intellectually diverse community.In a similar vein, I believe that I need an institutional environment that is more willing and able to actively engage in social dialogues at administrative and student levels\\\\u2013\\\\u2013an environment with a larger a platform upon which to engage in such dialogues and ideas, with more student involvement, awareness, interest, and openness to listening and engaging, as well as with more resources and opportunities for interested students to utilize.

It was always my favorite room, the room my mother moved into when my father came home in drunken fits. I didn\\'t understand what was happening. To my seven-year-old mind, it was the room where my mom would console me with tales about fairies when his addiction wreaked havoc in our home. But, at that moment, the room, once bespeckled with dancing fairies, was devoid of color and laden with stiff air. My brother held me still in his arms. It didn\\'t help. I heard the pounding, the screaming. Minutes dragged on. I couldn\\'t move. Finally I mustered the courage and clambered from my crouched position to the window and saw the sky illuminated with relief. Blue. White. Red.Blue. White. Red. I watched my father escorted away in handcuffs that night.I was born into silence. Living in the household of a violent addict disciplined me to believe that my words were not worthwhile.I sat in silence through my parents\\' divorce and the court mandated father-daughter counselling. The gray woman in the gray room was perplexed as to why I did not want to spend time around the charming man she urged me to call Daddy. I endured his violent change of attitude as we walked from the counselor\\'s office and back into reality. I endured the abuse that came with this mandated relationship. And then, I was fed up. The gray woman in her gray room seemed intimidating that day, but I knew what I had to do. The room rang as I stood up and screamed. The truth came out. I found my voice and I would never again return to docile reticence.After that, my life spiraled into an existence of friends\\' couches, my mother\\'s new nursing school books, boxes. Freedom. We scraped by, just my mom and me, moving from house to house as my mom\\'s measly income required. But there was peace. As I grew older, I matured into my experiences. I screamed, sang, survived. But, my new ability would not go without a purpose.My mom helped me to channel my confused emotions into productivity. She taught me to give. As a 13 year-old I began to volunteer at a soup kitchen. One day, I noticed a young boy escorting his mother through the dinner line. I recognized that he and his mother were likely in the same position as my mother and I were a few years ago. In an instant, the enigmatic socioeconomic gap was elucidated in my young mind. He was a kid, exactly as I was, who merely hailed from a less fortunate background. This revelation disgusted me. I felt like the eight year old I once was, acquiescent in the counselor\\'s office. I came to believe no child should have opportunity, their voice, taken from them. And seeing this boy made the world once again seem gray and all too oppressing, but I was not afraid to stand up and scream. This time, the cry came in the form of a student organization now called Students Opposing Starvation, endearingly termed SOS. My school had never had a student-proposed club before. Proposing SOS was paving a new road, painted with bylaws, meeting schedules, and Robert\\'s Rules of Order . After months of planning and a week of engaging activities leading up to a surprise unveiling of our first student organization, the first meeting of SOS had about a tenth of my student body attend. Now, we not only are growing in our impact, through new projects such as an outreach to elementary students about food sovereignty, but new branches of the student organization are being planted in two other high schools. I am determined that every child, no matter their background or the penury they face, have the same opportunity I did: to have a voice.\"}, {\"index\": 426, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Everything was a countdown for me. I was constantly tapping my feet to the rhythm of ticking clocks. One would think that there were an army after me, but no - I was simply addicted to time. My addiction started as something sincere. But when I started timing my conversations with my friends, and wearing two watches on my hand because I had to make sure I always had the correct time, it became an innocent habit gone amiss.I was on a downward spiral, refusing to see my addiction as wrong. But my friend knew it was wrong, and he thought he could help. He said he knew the root of my obsession. I couldn\\'t look away from the clock, because I didn\\'t want to lose a second of time. And I didn\\'t want to lose a second of time because I was afraid that losing time could negatively affect my future. \\'You know, it\\'s hard to focus on the present if you\\'re always worrying about the future,\\' he told me.He called himself a sun chaser. I had never understood his desire to chase the sun. I had never understood why anyone would desire to see every sunset, to see something so fleeting. But he wanted me to come with him, to pretend time didn\\'t exist. Just this once. At the time, we were at a hotel in Chicago that was adjoined to a tall parking garage, so our mission became reaching the top of the garage before the sun vanished. He forced me to leave my watches behind us for the short trip, and then we took off. We bolted out of the hotel lobby and onto the floor that connected the hotel building to the garage. We ran across the concrete parking lots, and had to ride up a few elevators before getting to the top. I distinctly remember him screaming as we ran. \\'Carpe diem, my friend!\\', he yelled. \\'Seize the day!\\' When we got to the top of the garage, I was caught by the view before me, and I stopped in my tracks. The sun had just hit the horizon, and had begun its spectacular goodnight show. I was overwhelmed by the hues the sun\\'s rays gave off, and I was welcomed by the way the sun seemed to hug the Chicago skyline. And all I could think was how funny it is that a person could see the same thing everyday and never notice its extravagance. I realized that I was missing out on half of my life, simply because I never felt that I had the time to focus on what was happening in the present. He had taught me to appreciate the now, and to worry less about the time and the future. He had taught me to simply live.Snapping out of my reverie, I found him staring at me, and I watched a smile spread across his face. \\'Was this worth your time?\\' he asked.\"}, {\"index\": 427, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Chemistry has always been a family affair. When I was in 1st grade in Japan, my mother took me to a state park to look at special mountains. They were special because sulfurous gas came out of the ground. My mother reached into her pocket and then said to me, \\'Why don\\'t you put these copper coins on top of where the sulfur gas comes out, and you\\'ll see what happens.\\' I put all the coins on the small hole and in less than a minute, all the coins became either green or black in color. Since I had no knowledge of Chemistry at the time, I had convinced myself that this phenomenon between copper and sulfur was nature\\'s own unexplainable magic. My grandfather also played a role in what would be my future passion. I used to leaf through his Chemistry books from the 1950s. He would tell me stories about how he got his MBA at the University of Michigan and how that helped him start his own biochemistry company. While Chemistry is a central science, I\\'m mostly interested in its potential to combat various environmental crises like drought, global warming, and decreases in agricultural production. I can see my future career as one that includes research and teaching. Much like my discovery on the mountain, I want to be able to ask questions about the world and use Chemistry as the answer. As someone who has tutored all my classmates in Honors Chemistry, I want to educate my peers and future students about how we can change the world using the magic and power of Chemistry. The University of Michigan is the ideal place for me to meet all my academic goals and serves as a launchpad for future career interests. The department offers a variety of academic areas where I can truly explore the possibilities of Chemistry and its role in solving environmental problems. I\\'m looking forward to the many research opportunities encouraged and available for Chemistry majors. Topics regarding Environmental Science, Thermochemistry, and Physical Chemistry are what interest me the most. I can\\'t wait to develop relationships with advisors so that I can be informed and supported on the research projects that I want to be involved in. I\\'d really like to have the opportunity to work with the faculty at CALC|UM program. I\\'m even more excited about expanding my teaching skills. I\\'d like to tutor undergraduates in Chemistry at the Science Learning Center and with the American Chemical Society. I want to improve my communication skills so that I can effectively explain Chemistry topics using accessible language. Studying at the University of Michigan would prepare me to be a world-class Chemistry researcher and teacher.I am capable of making money by my own without getting employed by silver market investment and reselling rare coins found from antique market. The reason I do not get employed because my mom and I are concerned about a drop in grades by spending time in work since I\\'m having a busy life keeping up with my grades, community service, and marching band. To afford college or buy supplies necessary for high school, I make about $1,500 by reselling rare coins from the 1800s or buying and selling silver on the silver market. Many of my friends are jealous about this because I can do this whenever on my free time, which is different from getting employed and has no affect at all to my busy life.Besides this, I have an extremely strong background in Chemistry. I always get the highest grade in any Chemistry regardless of high school or college. I took Honors Chemistry in my junior year, University of California Irvine Chemistry 1A in summer, and AP Chemistry in my senior year. I get the highest grade in all of my Chemistry class, even in college (1st rank in final grade and final exam out of 81 students at my UCI class). Because of this, my friends are jealous about my Chemistry skills. Therefore, I tutor my friends for $13/hour to make money for college. However, I had to challenge and work hard to become good at Chemistry.\\'One Challenge Became a Dream and a Major, and Maybe My Life\\'- Shungo Okubo 2014\"}, {\"index\": 428, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Pieces of shredded pork burst out of a gaping hole. The woman gawked at me from the other side of the counter.How could she expect me to wrap over two scoops of three-cheese queso and shredded pork without at least half of the filling squirting out? \\'I\\'m new,\\' I stuttered for the fiftieth time that day. It was my third week on the job at Qdoba Mexican Grill, and my lumpy, soggy burritos were a daily humiliation.I couldn\\'t understand why making a burrito was such a struggle when I had no trouble with calculus and memorizing hundreds of body parts for my anatomy class. During wrapping, the burrito would rip open, fall apart, or squirt out liquid. On the worst days, I fell victim to all three, but at that moment, I decided,\\'That\\'s it. I\\'m going to solve this problem and figure out how to properly wrap a burrito.\\' Glaring eyes watched my every move. Quickly heating another tortilla, I transferred the contents to the lower half so I could make more room to fold the tortilla. I wiped off the excess moisture after I noticed the sogginess that caused the tortilla to rip was from not draining the beans and pico de gallo well enough. Then, I tried a different wrapping method: a horizontal fold. To my delight, it stayed. I wrapped the orange foil over and gave it to the customer, proudly chirping, \\'Thank you. Enjoy!\\' I almost saw a hint of a smile on her face before she left. That day marked the start of steady improvement in my burrito-making career. Eventually, I was the one helping new workers with their tortilla positioning, guacamole spreading, and wrapping technique.From honing my burrito-wrapping craft, I discovered that studying a problem from different angles is the best approach. For example, every once in awhile, I stumble upon a tough calculus problem that requires a different approach. My experiences have led me to believe that anyone can learn anything as long as they set their mind to it. I\\'ve developed a mindset that has helped me look at mistakes as opportunities to grow and find better methods to solving problems.I took the same lessons I learned from Qdoba and applied them to other parts of my life. As the Pathophysiology team leader of Health Occupations Students of America (HOSA), I help my team members learn about diseases and prepare them for competitions. I used to provide written notes from the book, but I saw that many of my teammates struggled to understand glomerulonephritis because it\\'s so similar to other urinary diseases like nephritis. I decided to test new approaches of teaching the material: I matched pictures with diseases, made a model of a polycystic kidney using bubble paper, and created a \\'Be the Doctor\\' game. While learning with written notes and memorization worked for me, interactive learning through games provided both my team members and me with a deeper understanding of the material. My strategy made an impact: My team\\'s scores went from 60% to 90% on quizzes, and two of my teammates placed as Finalists at the State Leadership Conference. Burritos and HOSA taught me to look at problems from a different point of view and work with others to achieve goals. As an aspiring future doctor, I may have to use different approaches to find an underlying problem. One tiny problem could be affecting the whole body. I will also need to work closely with patients to find the best treatment based on their individual needs. Life is going to throw many more lumpy burritos at me, but I\\'m confident I can find alternative paths to the solution.\"}, {\"index\": 429, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'We\\'re a little worried about Katrina,\\' a voice came from above. I pulled my head above the table, straining my neck to look at my dad.                He furrowed a brow, \\'Oh?\\'               My Montessori teacher sighed. \\'She only wants to play puzzles all day instead of learning her alphabet. At this rate, she\\'s going to fall behind.\\'                To my naysaying teacher, my path to my college major would come as quite a surprise. There I was at three years old,  being scolded for falling behind. I thought this was quite the trick, but apparently, while I was preoccupied playing puzzles, my peers had surpassed me.         Two years later, in kindergarten, I experienced the exact same disapproval. Only this time, I was scolded for not being able to read.        \\'Katrina,\\' my teacher worried. \\'How are you supposed to keep up if you can\\'t read?\\'        My only response?        \\'I\\'m five.\\'       This response was found somewhat unsatisfactory.        However, as I saw my peers progressing without me, I decided that this simply would not do. Right then and there, I decided that I was going to force myself to read and  love literature. The most insane part? I actually did. As a young girl I devoured every book I could get my hands on. By elementary school, my early deficit had been erased, thanks in part to Roald Dahl, Laura Ingalls Wilder, and C.S. Lewis.                  As the daughter of a writer, I was raised by a master storyteller (or so he tells me). Even a trip to the store seemed like an adventure when my dad told it. When I entered high school, I wanted to master storytelling too. So, I joined a theatre company. Run by the boys\\' school nearby, Hannon Theatre not only taught me the art of storytelling, it also piqued my interest in journalism, as several of my castmates were working on their school\\'s newspaper. They had only one response when I told them I was thinking about signing up for my own school paper:                \\'Go for it!\\'                 Go for it I did. I became a reporter for the school newspaper and got my first assignment. ,A thousand words later, I emerged with my first article-an analysis of recent movie trends.  It was my first taste of writing, and I took to it like a moth to light. I was entranced. Throughout the next four years I went on to write a column in the local newspaper,work as features editor, and, my senior year, I was appointed editor-in-chief.                    For someone like me, majoring in  comparative literature seems natural. Looking back, my entire high school experience can be summed up in one word: storytelling. Stories fascinate me, and I want to study and compare the stories of the two languages in my life: English and Japanese.  I do not know what my future holds,but when the time comes I know I\\'ll be trained in something I love, and from that passion, a job that I truly enjoy will arrive.\\'We\\'re a little worried about Katrina,\\' a voice came from above.

Run by the boys\\' school nearby, Hannon Theatre not only taught me the art of storytelling, it also piqued my interest in journalism, as several of my castmates were working on their school\\'s newspaper. They had only one response when I told them I was thinking about signing up for my own school paper:                \\'Go for it!\\'                 Go for it I did. I became a reporter for the school newspaper and got my first assignment. ,A thousand words later, I emerged with my first article-an analysis of recent movie trends.  It was my first taste of writing, and I took to it like a moth to light. I was entranced. Throughout the next four years I went on to write a column in the local newspaper,work as features editor, and, my senior year, I was appointed editor-in-chief.                    For someone like me, majoring in  comparative literature seems natural. Looking back, my entire high school experience can be summed up in one word: storytelling. Stories fascinate me, and I want to study and compare the stories of the two languages in my life: English and Japanese.  I do not know what my future holds,but when the time comes I know I\\'ll be trained in something I love, and from that passion, a job that I truly enjoy will arrive.\"}, {\"index\": 430, \"new_personal_statement\": \"A few years ago, I was offered the opportunity of a lifetime. As First Prize winner in the Bradshaw and Buono International Piano Competition, I was able to perform at a recital hall of remarkable physical beauty and unmatched prestige: Carnegie Hall.Such an occasion is the archetype of success. Perhaps that is why, during weeks leading up to the performance, friends and family always felt it necessary to bring it up. \\'You know, Peter is going to be performing at Carnegie Hall,\\' they\\'d tell others. Needless to say, as I walked onto stage the Sunday afternoon of my performance, I was expecting something monumental.Just minutes later, I left stage feeling betrayed. Thoughts barraged my mind. Is it over? Was that all? Was it truly that quick? Did I do something wrong? Why didn\\'t I receive the \\'full effect\\' of Carnegie Hall I was expecting, something everyone had led me to anticipate? It took me years to realize that I did not do anything wrong that afternoon. In fact, the highlight of my performance was precisely what it needed to be: the music itself - when I became one with the keyboard, connected to a means of filling the hall with the tolling of bells, bel canto of the tenor, and streams of emotion gushing from Rachmaninoff\\'s \\'Prelude in G-sharp minor.\\' In this way, my Carnegie Hall performance was a humbling moment and remarkable milestone I have come to appreciate more and more. It also is a testament to how paramount the piano has been in my life. The instrument\\'s position in my family\\'s home reflects this literally as the first thing you notice when you walk in the front door. It occupies most of our \\'dining\\' room (ironically, a place where food is not permitted). It sometimes acts as a looking glass, revealing my feelings through Bach or Prokofiev, just as its shiny black surface reflects any passers-by. At other times, the piano is an 88-keyed foe, a mortal enemy bound to frustrate with its literature\\'s whirlwind passages, intense emotional undertakings, intricate phrasings, and delicate harmonic counterpoint.But most of all, the piano serves as a reminder that I am someone unique. It reminds me I have been with something for eleven years, through the good and the bad. The piano allows me to see steady progression from the age of five to the age of sixteen, from a first-grader playing five-note melodies to a teenager performing sonatas and concerti. Although I have had many fine achievements in music, what I have found most remarkable is the experience and fortitude my years of piano study have granted me. I have used the challenges presented by the keyboard to hone analyzation and problem-identification skills crucial for improvements in music and for academic success. A difficult technical passage on the keyboard requires me to slow down and analyze issues plaguing my performance; a complex calculus problem requires me to look step-by-step to see what is keeping me from the correct answer. Likewise, performing a piece requires expression in order to make the notes on the page spring to life and convey aural beauty, just as explaining a piece of literature requires thought beyond the printed words and a level of insight to make connections between an interpretation and the original rhetoric.I\\'m often asked, \\'Are you going to keep up piano in college and beyond?\\' To me, the answer is a resounding \\'yes.\\' While I am not sure if I will pursue music professionally, I know that I will not have found that area in which I will be capable of achieving excellence - success that is sustained beyond just a specific moment like a Carnegie Hall debut - until I find a field I love as much as I love the piano.\"}, {\"index\": 431, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 432, \"new_personal_statement\": \" I felt like Aladdin after his first encounter with the genie as I stared down at the heaps of shiny coins in the large fountain. I reached into my pocket and searched for a coin among the rubber bands and paperclips.   Victorious, I held up a coin and tried to think of a wish. This fountain seemed more special than all the other fountains in the world, there in front of the City of Hope Hospital near Los Angeles.   \\'I wish for my research project to go well,\\' I pleaded with the fountain, nervous for my first day as a student researcher at the hospital\\'s Mathematical Oncology center.   I was about to throw the coin when a woman holding the hand of a small boy slammed into me.  \\'Sorry, excuse me,\\' she muttered.  \\'No problem,\\' I said startled.   I watched them enter the hospital and into a nearby waiting room. I suddenly realized that I was to meet my mentor in there so I rushed inside, the coin and the fountain forgotten.  I took a seat in the waiting room near the same mother and child. I took out my paper notebook and began to brainstorm ideas for my research project. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed the mother pouring over medical records, wisps of thin blonde hair framing tired eyes while her son pushed a toy train around on the table between us. My train of thought about analyzing cytokine data as a type of immunotherapy was broken when the train crashed into my bag at the opposite end of the table. Looking up, I realized that the boy\\'s clumps of blond hair and patches of baldness around his head were clearly effects of chemotherapy. I forced myself to look back at my notes. Unable to concentrate, the charts turned blurry after a few minutes and I started to look around the room at the other people in it.  Most of the people in the waiting room had the same tired expression on their face. I was suddenly reminded of the magazines in my pediatrician\\'s waiting room that featured games in which one had to find similarities between two pictures. I could spot the same stress lines, tired eyes, and slumped shoulders on a patient or family member despite the differences in age or gender.   Only then did it hit me that the data in my notebook meant that the cells I was to research had some truly villainous characteristics, causing the tired eyes and weary hearts in this very room. I was suddenly fiercely determined to make the most of my internship and fight as hard I could to make sense of these nefarious cells.   It was then that my internship mentor appeared and spotted me. I was looking forward to meeting him, an accomplished scientist and a hardened warrior in the battle against cancer. After an introduction, we walked to the outside of the building near the fountain. I was suddenly reminded of my coin throwing. Still filled with the fierce determination, now I knew what my wish should be.   After excusing myself, I quickly jogged over to the fountain and took the coin out of my pocket. I reflected on the heaps of coins, all likely remnants of desperate wishes to end the suffering of loved cancer patients.   \\'I wish the projects of every cancer researcher around the world are successful,\\' I said, tossing the coin.  I rejoined my mentor and we walked into the research center, away from the fountain. The waiting room encounter would forever be imprinted in my mind, motivating me to work harder to find a new way to analyze indiscernible data and devour further cancer research papers. My love for neuroscience and this memory cement my desire to pursue cancer research in college and beyond as a physician and scientist.   \"}, {\"index\": 433, \"new_personal_statement\": \" While I first learned to communicate as a young child, I didn\\'t truly speak until I was fifteen. Music\\'s arms first embraced me when my dad unveiled the realm of jazz to me. He covertly snuck me into a jazz caf\\\\u00e9, eager to pull back the curtain covering the jazz world. Seeing the caf\\\\u00e9, empty, confined and bleak, even on a Saturday night, he assured me that my underage presence would see the fresh jazz talent arriving any second.Sure enough, fans soon piled in, cramping the already narrow room. The racket gradually grew until my thoughts were drowned out of my head; such anticipation was a completely unprecedented experience. The noise cut. In walked the quartet, the air dry from their casual workday stride. The saxophone player put his lips to his mouthpiece. The bassist stood alert, eyes darting back and forth. The drummer counted them in. From just their first note, I found a reality in my vision of the raw emotion that music is meant to make youfeel:eyes watering, jittering from excitement, and shaking with enthusiasm. From just their first note, I was captivated; jazz music became my absolute obsession. From just their first note, I was infatuated with the shiver in my spine when I hear my next favorite song. It was as if I was seeing two dimensionally my whole life, and instead of looking back and forth, left and right, I was finally able to look up.Experiencing such a range of emotions while listening to their fluid performance, I wanted to try it all myself. In the scorching heat of a humid summer, I journeyed cities wide to a sandy second-hand guitar store. Hundreds of guitars hung on the walls. I walked back and forth between the rows, fingers trailing across their bodies, looking at the specs, searching for a connection. I found Betsy in the far back, sitting dusty and weak. Betsy was my first love; as soon as I sat to test her out, I knew she was the one for me. The feeling of her weight in my hands, the slight buzzy second-hand sound of the strings, and her warm toneencompassed what I was looking for. I couldn\\'t afford to be extravagant since I was paying for the bass with money from my first job, but Betsy didn\\'t need me to. I was opened to a completely new way to express myself: bass strings as my brush, I learned to paint my unfiltered picture out to the world. My life was changed; music became not only my creative outlet, but also a facet of my personality. Since then, I see musical patterns and color in everything, adding intricate shading to mundane objects. The acapella cover of birds in the morning, the steady rhythmic pattern of bricks in the sidewalk, or the fast drumming of the roadside drill perform for me casually as I live through a life-long concert. It\\'s changed my outlook on everyday things.Music has cultivated my creativity.A jazz piece is more than a combination of notes, and likewise, my creativity is more than imitation. As I improvise, I take unscripted risks. I play what I want to hear, not what I think others want to hear. When I\\'m a musician, I\\'m my most true self.Just as authors conversethrough ink, musicians chat with sound. The more music I play, the more fluent I become; after I greet my bass, we converse for hours like old friends. I\\'m finally able to think deeply, harmony between myself and music. I can hear shades of color.\"}, {\"index\": 434, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I was eight years old and my parents could take no more. They were out of options. I was going to get some help.Why? I was never a classroom insurgent, or a budding James Dean. It was actually the complete opposite-- I was, in essence, scared of everything. I mean everything in the most literal sense. I stayed awake crying until 3AM nightly because I was afraid of 1) the dark 2) robots in my closet 3) falling asleep and having nightmares, and 4) not being able to fall asleep. Daylight hours provided no relief, as I had a paralyzing fear of mummies, and in a grand, ironic twist of fate, we were studying Ancient Egypt. So I was sent to therapy, which, in retrospect, was completely useless. I learned that the terror I felt over a mummy exhibition or the darkness under my bed could only be eased with time.As time passed, newer and bigger fears replaced the old ones. Fear of failure, of change, of rejection\\\\u2014I had it all. People and places were frightening; I felt so small against the world. It was infinitely simpler to fade into the background of a class, or stay at home from a school dance, or be content as seventh-chair viola of an orchestra.Orchestra, in particular, was a singularly terrifying and yet ultimately invaluable experience. At my first rehearsal with the Orange County Youth Symphony Orchestra, I was awed and daunted in equal measure by the sheer talent of my fellow musicians. In my eyes, they were veritable giants. It was all the more shocking, then, when a few rehearsals later, our principal viola conspicuously missed an entrance. I\\'m not sure what I expected to happen-- the maestro to shout a scathing reprimand, maybe, or Zeus\\' lightning bolt to strike from the heavens. But she just jumped right back in. The conductor hardly looked her way. I saw then that these people were only giants because I had made them to be so. Yes, they were musically more advanced than I, but I had subconsciously tried to apotheosize them. In reality, they were human beings who made mistakes, just like me.Unlike my aversion to mummies or the dark, my fears and trepidation didn\\'t just fade away. I began to see that they were holding me back. So, I forced myself to face whatever I was afraid of. I hesitantly sat in the front of classes and participated in discussions. I dragged myself to a school dance and, surprisingly, had fun. And as for orchestra, I watched and listened and learned, loving every moment. One day, I took a deep breath and typed out an email to a professor asking for lessons, a prospect that I had wrestled with for months. Within minutes a friendly response was in my inbox. Under his tutelage, I sat principal viola by junior year. The new paths that opened up just by being more proactive were astonishing. Finally, I was doing something.I am an avid keeper of journals. In my journal, I have scribbled a Note to Myself, and it reads, \\'Do one thing a day that scares you\\', as spoken by Eleanor Roosevelt. This Note to Myself is my motivation, mantra, and promise to myself. I look back at my life thus far and I see everything I have accomplished, but right next to that I see the might-have-beens and the what-ifs. Regret is not a happy feeling, and I have spent too long wallowing in it. But although I regret lost opportunities, I do not regret my own fears. It is these fears that have shaped me into the person I am today--someone who will take initiative, someone who is not afraid to explore and learn, someone who will conquer each day one fear at a time.Maybe therapy did help after all.\"}, {\"index\": 435, \"new_personal_statement\": \" With weak knees, I stepped onstage in front of a sleek glass podium. Hundreds of eyes were glued to my face. A trickle of sweat crawled down my back, my bowtie felt like a noose around my neck and my tongue began to crack from dehydration. To my left was Ryan Murphy; to my right was Julia Roberts. This was it. I swallowed a deep breath of air and began to share my story.Growing up, I never had any particular hardships. I came from a stable middle-class family with two parents and Frank, a typically irksome older brother. While my life seemed a carbon copy of everyone else\\'s life in my neighborhood, something about it was different. It wasn\\'t until 6th grade when I was called \\'that fucking queer\\' that I started to understand. I rushed home from school in a whirlwind of thought. I researched until my fingers gave out about what it meant to be gay. Everything about it felt liberating. And taboo. Was it really something so bad that I deserved to be bullied? I thought I should hide it to save myself from ridicule.Yet, wanting to openly express myself continued to gnaw at the back of my mind. I felt a burning desire to yell out every time I heard \\'that\\'s so gay\\' in the hallways, but at the same time, I felt stifled by the desire to blend in and avoid victimization. Not only did I feel I would be bullied for coming out, but I also felt I\\'d be completely alone fighting this battle. I knew there must be other gay students like me out there. But where were they? At my school, it was as if gay students didn\\'t exist; no one dared to come out.Mahatma Gandhi once said \\'You must be the change you wish to see in the world.\\' I came to the realization that no one in my school was going to come out, unless someone else did first. So be the change I wished to see, right? With a deep breath, I found the courage to say to my mom and dad, \\'I\\'m gay.\\' I thought I would be met with a solid \\'No. It\\'s unnatural. A sin,\\' but the response I received was far different from anything I ever imagined (and trust me I spent many sleepless nights contemplating every possible response). Both my parents gazed into my eyes with a slight expression of shock and trepidation, and simultaneously opened their arms for a strong embrace. No words were spoken. No tears. No hate. Just love and support. With fortification from my family, I mustered the courage to come out at school.I wish I could say I wasn\\'t bullied or harassed, but I was. I was also made to feel lesser in the classroom. In Italian class, boys were taught how to ask girls out on a date. In my class \\'Issues of Tolerance,\\' homosexuality was taught to be a lifestyle that could be changed through conversion therapy. In AP Government, we were shown a 42 minute Westboro Baptist Church hate film that continuously spewed \\'God hates fags, All fags deserve to die\\\\u2026\\' While none of my teachers\\' intents came from malice, the effect was harmful. I realized I needed to re-humanize the dehumanized LGBT community. I looked online and contacted GLSEN. The Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network.GLSEN gave me my voice. They empowered me to speak out to my school board, various media outlets, and New Jersey State legislators. Our anti-bullying and LGBT inclusive curriculum platform helped make schools safer for LGBT youth. All students deserve a safe and affirming school environment. This led me to the L.A.

My friend Brooke and I have just finished mopping paint off the floor when we decide to walk outside instead of sitting in the school.The air chills when we step outside, allowing me to think more clearly than before. We wander over to the little strip of grass opposite the school and sit down. I lay back and right above me are a million twinkling lights and one sparkling moon wadding in utter darkness. Brooke is gazing at the sky along with me when suddenly she asks, \\'What do you suppose is out there?\\' Immediately my mind races to almost a year ago when I was waiting in bumper-to-bumper traffic with my dad as he mentioned a book in the backseat he recently plucked from the library. \\'I think you would enjoy the book; it\\'s written by Stephen Hawking.\\'\\'Might as well, we\\'re not going anywhere anytime soon.\\' I sighed.I opened the cover and launched into A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking. The book began simply with the history and development of science, information I already studied in school. Hawking then divulged into wormholes, quarks, black holes, and the ever-expanding universe where we live.

Rosin escaped my bow in puffs. Nervously wiping my hands against my gown, my mind flashed to the months of rehearsals that rested upon this one performance, this one hour of beauty in vibrations. As the conductor finally raised his arms, the orchestra became a single being, and with a unison breath, the stage became electrified.As long as I can remember, my parents have been cramming mathematical formulas into my brain. Physics phenomena. Chemical equations. Intellectual prowess was heavily emphasized throughout my youth and I grew up thinking that only academic excellence mattered. My life revolved around school, measuring my worth as a number between 0 and 100. However, when I was seven, my parents enrolled me in piano lessons, deviating from their mechanical plan for me. Although I improved quickly and blossomed as a musician, my focus remained academics, narrowing my thinking and curtailing the breadth of my new talent. I was to be a scholar, not an artist.Despite this, I steadily expanded my involvement in performing arts and attempted to juggle the two realms. Over time, my dedication to both violin and piano became central to my personality, manifesting itself my junior year. For months, I immersed myself in chamber orchestra at a personally unprecedented level, preparing rigorously for the upcoming ASTA music festival. Before long, the competition arrived and I found myself on stage, overcome by a slew of emotions. Transcendent.        Hidden tears flowed freely before we even reached our second piece, slipping between my chin and my fiddle. We had all been fiercely committed to producing perfection. And, as it seems, we did.        \\'Grand National Champions: Clark.\\'        Those four words sent us all into blind euphoria that persisted long after leaving the stage. Even now, months later, my heart still swells with pride. As the trip concluded, I realized that this wasn\\'t just a performance. I gained something far more valuable than any plaque on my shelf or any certificate in my folder: self-acceptance.        My whole life, I dedicated my accomplishments to making my parents proud. Since they always pushed me so hard, I developed the idea that I was inherently inadequate and constantly tried to prove that I was up-to-par through countless assignments upon reports upon projects that all earned A\\'s. I perpetuated my inadequacy complex by projecting my assumption of dissatisfaction onto them. This was incredibly detrimental for my self-perception and I suffered extensively under the crippling misconception that I was never good enough.        However, after eleven years and one very profound experience, I have finally accepted that I am enough. Winning ASTA opened my eyes because for the first time, I felt that I had accomplished something for myself. This wasn\\'t something that I was trying to prove to my parents. It was not for them, not for my r\\\\u00e9sum\\\\u00e9, not for my reputation. The accomplishment was for me and the unadulterated pride that I felt was due to my own validation. This was mine.        Finally breaking free of the shackling expectation to live up to an unreal construct of perfection, I transformed as a person. Attending a math and science academy, everything was perpetually ones and zeroes, definitive and concrete. In my mind, then, there was a set standard of flawlessness that I could never achieve. Music, however, defied this idea completely. Art demands nonconformity through individual interpretation, and thus perfection can only be achieved with intentional \\'mistakes,\\' serving as an allegory for my life. I have come to accept my mistakes as beautiful in their own right because, as clich\\\\u00e9 as it may be, it is not one\\'s mistakes that define them, but how they respond to them. I am me not in spite of my mistakes, but because of them.

I once thought of myself as a storyteller first and a writer second. Writing was my method for communicating my stories, but I cared more about the content than the combinations of words and punctuation. However, after experimenting with various types of writing, through student journalism and writing monologues for showcases and trying to publish a young adult book, I\\'ve realized that writing is a beautiful art because of how it transmits stories. And anything can be a story, whether it\\'s a personal background or the history of a dead civilization or the cause of a war. I think in stories; I\\'m constantly considering how causes become effects or how a character develops from his or her experiences. And that consideration encourages understanding; when you know a person or situation\\'s story, empathy and willingness to compromise come with ease. I want to continue to work with stories, both fictitious ones and those that make headlines, to promote that understanding.While I\\'m still editing and trying to publish my manuscript today, I realize that even if it never sees bookshelves, writing and editing it encouraged me to be braver and more willing to change to improve. Writing is a form of storytelling, and there are stories\\\\u2014news, literature, and narratives\\\\u2014that need to be shared to promote understanding, and I want to share them through journalistic and literary work.\"}, {\"index\": 444, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 445, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Kindergarteners often want to be astronauts; a former kindergartener, I stuck with my dream longer than most.

My need to explore shapes who I am and how I view the world, whether I\\'m performing a Strauss horn concerto or counting down to lift-off.For the past four years, I\\'ve spent my nights in a rundown building by a NASA airfield, home to our all-girls FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team, the Space Cookies. On a typical night, the programmers rule the whiteboards. We scribble free-body diagrams, drafting complex algorithms to keep our robot aligned. \\'Aha!\\' cries Divya,\\'the derivative of rotational error is rotational joystick speed!\\' Lynn, another rookie, doodles a smiley by \\'dtheta\\'.Our rookies love calculus but couldn\\'t have solved this problem last September. Being on the Space Cookies means we work together, pass on knowledge, and leverage our strengths. They are the family--one with 115 sisters--that has most shaped my intellectual independence and my aspiration to become an astronaut.I was always asking questions as a kid, but joining the Cookies focused my curiosity onto something useful and fascinating. In the lab, I learn everyday, be it a new soldering technique, design skill, or programming trick, spurring my interest in math, physics, and computer science. To program our robot, I enrolled in C++ summer courses and AP Computer Science. A team founder loves to say, \\'Do the math, save the world,\\' so I think he\\'s pleased that I\\'m tackling linear algebra and multivariable calculus outside high school.My robotics team is a platform from which I can explore the world around me. To help me create a gyro interface, a mechanical mentor brought her aerospace engineer boyfriend to teach me about Fourier transforms and Nyquist frequencies. In programming our robot to track its position like a computer mouse, I disassembled thirty old mice and learned to measure their voltages with an oscillator. The Space Cookies culture, full of intellectual curiosity and chances to delve deep wherever a challenge takes us, led me, fittingly and poetically, to NASA\\'s recruitment page. I realised that being an astronaut was just a corollary to participating in robotics--a giant leap, but for me, just the next small step. I want to revolutionise space exploration, researching electric propulsion to carry spacecraft further and designing algorithms to make them smarter. From conducting experiments in the International Space Station\\'s zero-gravity environment, to building lunar outposts, to colonising Mars, I embrace the challenge. My desire to know what is out there drives me to prepare to become an astronaut.The Cookies have nurtured my intellectual growth and independence, providing knowledgeable mentors and fancy machines, and more importantly, our goal of building the best robot we can. My robotics community has convinced me that I can do what I thought impossible. Exploring space as an astronaut to push boundaries, satisfy scientific curiosity, and share what I learn is no longer an unattainable dream but a tangible goal.As a child, I filled notebooks with symbols and ciphers of my own devising, each with a certain meaning. I know now that I was creating rudimentary languages. Back then, I simply loved the patterns I found everywhere around me. To me, computer science (CS) is a field based in the study of patterns. From its roots in math, which Michael D. Resnik called the \\'Science of Patterns\\' in his 1981 text, to the concept of design patterns, CS interests me because it harnesses patterns to address challenges.I am endeared to the CS field of natural language processing (NLP), which plays to my pattern-loving nature. Computers learning to extract meaning from human language, finding patterns amongst noise to create understanding, fascinates me. NLP is essential for developing true artificial intelligence, which I hope to pursue as a career. As president and founder of my school Linguistics Club, I lead weekly meetings with presentations from students and professionals, such as Stanford University\\'s Dr. Dan Jurafsky, and compete in the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad. Through this club, I discovered my passion for applying CS in linguistics.My background in mathematics, physics, and computing prepares me to study CS at university. At my school, I have taken all available honours-level maths courses, from Algebra I to Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics to AP Calculus BC. To pursue maths beyond my school offerings, I am taking multivariable calculus after school and linear algebra at Stanford University. In 2013, I competed in Ciphering Time Trials in my math club, a mathematics competition, placing 24th nationally for my grade. This spring I will study light and heat physics at Stanford University. My enthusiasm for maths and physics has fostered my intellectual independence, curiosity, and work ethic; I learned to manage my workload, approach challenges, and pursue my interests despite limited resources.For two years, I have been the Programming Captain of my NASA-sponsored FIRST robotics team, responsible for the creation and function of our robots\\' code. In my fourth year on the team, I have thousands of hours writing and debugging C++ programs for robotics systems: PID control, computer vision, optical flow, autonomous motion, trapezoidal motion profiling, and more. My team nominated me for the Dean\\'s List Award for the student who best demonstrates leadership, commitment, and technical expertise and passion.In the summer of 2014 as an engineering intern at Tango.me, a video-messaging company, I built back-end cataloguing software, collaborating in a professional environment. My years of CS experience enabled me to compete in a regional hackathon, neoHack15 in San Francisco, for which I developed a music app to fit the user\\'s heartbeat, and won the 2nd-place prize.I have read Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig\\'s Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, as well as Resnik\\'s Algorithms. While programming an ELIZA-based chatbot for a school project, I found the text comprehensive and insightful, and learned to use neural networks. I find Algorithms a well-written text that explains various algorithms, from sorting to graph, as understandable concepts while retaining depth and academic rigour.Extracurricularly, I play the French horn in a local youth symphony and compete as an ep\\\\u00e9e fencer. To support my interests in natural language processing as a field of CS, I am studying foreign languages such as Spanish, Russian, and Mandarin Chinese. Human language lends itself as an organic analog of CS, which has its own languages.As an international student, studying in the United Kingdom will be an opportunity to experience culture outside of California, where I have spent my entire life. I seek to broaden my experiences and gain an understanding of the world around me from different perspectives. Studying in the UK, I can gain a rigorous and specialised education in a place of diversity in thought and background.For the past four years, I\\'ve spent my nights in a rundown building by a NASA airfield, home to our all-girls robotics team, the Space Cookies.

How couldthis possibly become a story of failure? Quite simply, as we soon discovered; no matter how latewe stayed up or how many activities we planned, we could not engage our students. Everylesson, our questions were met with blank stares with the exception of the same two studentswho knew all the answers. Each night, we asked each other the same question: \\'What else canwe do?\\'Eventually, our students began to notice our desperate attempts to salvage our lessonplans. Once, my partner and I painstakingly made a class mascot that we planned to use in abody parts lesson.

This pattern repeated itself for the duration ofthe program. Before I knew it, I was finished with the program, and the kids left one-by- one. Thesadness that I felt as I watched them leave was also tinged with relief, as I would no longer beburdened with the stress of failing kids whose English levels I had hoped to improve.Looking back on the experience now, I realize that the program was extremely valuablein teaching me the importance of persistence. Each day, there was nothing that my partner andI could do but stand at the front of the classroom and carry on.

My height, however, suddenly became an issue during Eighth Grade. After several years of measuring five-foot-nothing with no sign of change, whispers of \\'growth hormone deficiency\\' began to appear as a subtext to my flat-lining stature. My parents\\' concerns ultimately led me to an endocrinologist\\'s examining table, where I patiently waited for the doctor. I entertained myself by listening to the sound of the crinkling white paper shifting beneath me. I will admit that being taller than a Tolkien Elf had briefly crossed my mind, especially when measuring myself against the linemen on our football team. I wondered how life would differ if I possessed the imposing presence of the Greek Mythological heroes that I have enjoyed studying for years. Yet, it was hard to imagine Achilles marching with the band, bells in tow, to the tune of \\'Build Me Up Buttercup.\\'When the doctor entered, her beige clothing made her a chameleon against the blandly decorated room. But the papers in her hand were not so easily overlooked. After giving a quick nod of recognition to my anxious mother, she efficiently conferred a diagnosis and treatment plan. Much like the man who sold Jack the Magic Beans, she offered an almost unbelievable substance: Somatropin, better known as Human Growth Hormone (HGH). HGH would stimulate growth and also help me develop muscles more easily while reducing the risk of heart disease, improving sight and hearing, and making me immortal. Okay, everything but the immortality part. The doctor then asked, what I would do with it all. The truth remained I wasn\\'t sure. The immediate idea of triumphantly towering over my older brother held some fascination. On the other hand, few characters permeating the fantasy series that fill my bookshelves are giants. Fone Bone and Bilbo Baggins would have trouble reaching their tomes on my top shelf.I self-administered my Magic Beans via a small, but surprisingly painful, needle. The drudgery of giving myself the shot soon took the place of flossing as my least favorite nightly ritual. There was no direct result of my efforts throughout that first year. However, about halfway through sophomore year, I appeared to shoot up overnight. People who had not seen me in a while commented on my sudden spurt. Best of all, the promise of finally looking down on my big brother was fulfilled. Yet, there was little more than that \\\\u2013 just appearance and a few comments. The novelty of height was interesting, but hardly life altering. My rapidly emerging muscles were of little or no help with the wrist cramps I developed as I set out to write my first fantasy novel. Despite writing pages of various physical and emotional details of my own characters, I rarely find necessity in describing their heights.Because my athletic star has not risen over the past several years, I have had the luxury of not attending any sport-related practices. Instead, I use my time reading literature and drafting and redrafting my medieval saga. I discovered that being tall has little value when competing in the English Speakers\\' Union Shakespeare Competition or representing North Korea in Model United Nations. Everything I enjoy and experience today is exactly the same as it was before HGH. I suspect that would be true even if I had the diminutive stature of Tyrion Lannister.The pseudo-immortality that was once offered by those Magic Beans has thus far eluded my six-foot-one-inch frame. Just as parents often say that they care little about the gender of their child, as long as he or she is happy and healthy, I hold a similar outlook about my physique. As long as I have hands that can write, a mind that can think, and a life expectancy that gives me time to realize accomplishment, I am grateful, regardless of where I stand on the growth chart.\"}, {\"index\": 449, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Class of \\\\\\\\\\\\u201898 (CommonApp Essay)Leafing through yet another list of unimpressive credentials, a bespectacled social worker tosses aside his yellowed file.

I know it seems odd to gauge my fortune that way, but today, I am contentknowing that I have a reliable enough income to purchase a steady stream of insects to feed my first pet, a treefrog named Marshall. A sky-blue, marshmallow-of-a-frog with a permanent smile and clown-sized feet, he is aboutthe size of a kiwi but the shape of a beefsteak tomato. In retrospect, he signifies not only the prosperity of my firstjob, but marks the first time in my life when I didn\\'t want, or need, my parents\\' help.When I first got him however, the more daunting significance was that with a lifespan of up to 20 years, Marshallcould far outlive my time at home. In fact, he may as well be my first child, and just like a parent, no matter howmany times he pooped on me, dumped water on the floor, or refused to eat his mealworms, I wanted only the bestfor him. So naturally, feeling responsible in a way I hadn\\'t before getting Marshall, I set out to build him a truerainforest .There aren\\'t many vivarium-building 101 classes out there, so I was just as uneducated about rainforest-buildingas I was about frog-keeping. With the help of Home Depot, an online herpetoculture supply company, and theexperts at the vet clinic where I work, I was able to design and build Marshall his own two square-foot slice ofAmazonia. With layer after layer of silicone, foam, cork, and substrate, his new home began to come together.After the addition of exotic plants and mosses (which I came to discover are ironically as hard to keep alive asMarshall), I added springtails, a decomposer, to complete the ecosystem.Since the plants needed time to acclimate, I spent the next 30 days experimenting with different lighting andhumidity levels, trying to find the right balance of heat and light to satisfy both my needy plants and my high-maintenance frog. A month later, Marshall left his temporary tank of plastic plants and prepackaged moss. Withmy proud parents beside me, I cut the ceremonial ribbon (yes, there actually was a ceremony with a ribbon), andhe flopped out into his new home for the first time.An entire summer of work was concentrated into that 12x12x18\\' tank. Each day, I would leave my full-time job atthe vet clinic to work at my other full-time job as a vivarium architect. Hours of creation and experimentation,hundreds of hard-earned dollars, and countless moments of parental anxiety contributed to a well-lit, 20 lb.collection of dirt, wood, and plants. But it is also a home, an ecosystem; it is a dynamic work of art that iscontinually growing. It was and is a priceless investment, but its value is not expressed in monetary terms.

Absolutely yes\\\\u2026 My earliest childhood memories were made on the misty banks of a dam, with a rod in hand and my father\\'s guidance looking over me. On my 6th birthday my father arrived home with a surprise for me- a child size fishing rod. I was confused, yet ecstatic to have received a small version of a grown up\\'s toy. This gift would turn out to fuel my biggest passion and interest!Catching a fish in the last ten seconds of a tournament in order to win may sound nerve-racking, but itsays a lot about yourself.Great things take time and discipline and together with patience they can separate you from the rest. I\\'ve sat on boats for hours on end, crossed river after river and walked the banks till I could no more. The soles of my feet have ached, my hands have shivered, but Ikept going. I take whatever weather arises along with my definite streak of independence. There are days when dozens of fish come to my hand, yet others where I fish late into the sunset without a touch. I\\'ve waited for hours to get a chance at a fish and at times the chance has evaded me, but I come back and try again.Some wonder at the long hours spent fly fishing and what draws me in. The reality is that this is where I am most comfortable.Often standing knee-deep in a river, I reflect on how fishing has shaped me, especially the unpredictability of it. Fly fishing requires that you adapt to what is happening on the water at the time, which has taught me to adapt and cope well under pressure. Fly fishing is also a great leveler. I take responsibility for my actions - it is just you and the fish and nobody else to blame.I am committed to a way of life \\\\u2013 living in harmony with nature.My fly fishing skills have allowed me to instill my passion in others. I believe that in order to master a skill, you ought to be able to teach it. I show developing fishermen the fine skills and tricks, allowing me to give back to the community, young and old, that once taught me unconditionally. I met Tom through volunteering at the Lourensford dams. It was his first day with a fly rod, which reminded me of how excited I had been when I caught my first trout - the perfect opportunity to re-enact the moment. I taught him the mechanics of casting and my three P\\'s - patience, persistence and positivity. He proceeded to catch his first trout ever. The ecstatic grin on his face will remain a heartwarming sight forever.Through fly fishing I\\'ve learnt that paying attention to detailsoften tends to make the biggest impact as to whether you succeed or not. I was representing my country at the FIPS-Mouche World Youth Fly Fishing Championships in some of the most arduous conditions I have experienced. One fish was required from me to secure a medal. I persevered for three hours, sweat soaking the inside of my waders. I made sure every cast was perfect - not a centimeter to the right or left. My perseverance and precision resulted in two fish on my scorecard. I became the youngest individual to win a session at Worlds and scored South Africa the first team medal ever.It is the call of the stream that keeps me going; enabling me to become more disciplined, patient and appreciative of opportunities afforded to me, by people and nature. A simple fishing rod changed the way I look at life. In the end, it is not only the fish that I fish for, but the lessons too.\"}, {\"index\": 453, \"new_personal_statement\": \"As the cliche states, \\'You are what you eat\\'. My favorite restaurant by far is Meadow, a pan-asian restaurant in my hometown of Simsbury. At just seven minutes away from my house, Meadow is more than convenient; I can practically smell the beef lo mein wafting through my front door. Open since 2008, the owners now have two locations and a steady stream of loyal customers, including my family. They know the nuances of our orders by heart: my mother\\'s multiple appetizers, my father\\'s steamed (not fried) dumplings and my sister\\'s double order of wonton soup (without the wontons, but with the savory strips of pork and scallion). When it comes to my order, however, Meadow has never been a mindless thirty-second decision; with 27 appetizers, 36 entrees, 65 sushi options, 11 noodle and rice options and 48 lunch options, the menu seems an infinite array of choice. I have to weigh my options meticulously; otherwise my stomach will never deflate in time for dessert. As a self-proclaimed gastronome\\\\u2014someone who loves mouthwatering food\\\\u2014picking between menu items like salmon sushi and crab rangoon is challenging; I always want to try everything. Sitting in the dimly lit restaurant in August when its French doors are open and the muggy night air drifts inside for a visit, or in January when the same French doors are cosily framed by frost, I have tried an enormous variety of meals. From chicken lettuce wraps to massaman curry, from unagi to salmon teriyaki, exploring and discovering new favorites is not uncommon for me. Going to Meadow is always a delicious venture, but my gastronomic curiosity feeds my whole being, not just my stomach. I eat up new information just as rapidly as I eat up their astoundingly crunchy spring rolls that dissolve in my mouth. I have to experience everything: all the sushi, all the desserts, and all the classes that I can squeeze into my schedule. Giving up the anthropology class because it will not fit into my schedule is just as upsetting as giving up the fried ice cream because it will not fit into my stomach. I am a voracious reader, both of books and of Meadow\\'s menu. Learning about Ancient Egypt, the intersection of abolitionism and feminism in 1830s America, the ethics behind the HeLa cell, or being able to use an exponential function successfully makes me feel as fulfilled and content as devouring a delectable meal. Meadow has fostered my intrinsic need to learn, to discover and to experience everything. I know how to select what I want off of their menu, but I also know how to select what I want in life. I want knowledge. In fact, I\\'m hungry for it. I could really go for a class on microbiology right now\\\\u2014with a side of edamame, of course.\"}, {\"index\": 454, \"new_personal_statement\": \"UC Application Essays :1. Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud and how does it relate to the person you are?\\'I feel good! Oh, I feel so good!\\' I shouted out at the top of my lungs as a member that I serve asked about my well-being. I always felt awkward responding in this particular manner, but it is all in good spirit of promoting positivity and altruism within our daily schedule. Occasionally, my neighboring peers would get embarrassed by me and would keep their distance, but I stand my ground, completing the chant to its entirety and finishing it off with a scream.What is considered \\'normal\\' nowadays? Must we follow societal norms and never deviate from them? I used to be more hidden and disengaged in many extracurricular activities; academics was my top priority as I was told that I needed to be better than everyone else in order to go to a good college. My main motivation in doing community service at first was because it is a requirement to graduate from high school. Never have I thought to grasp what it meant to serve the community and to change lives of so many individuals. Today, I am a selfless and compassionate leader, feeling more confident and comfortable in my own body.I remember when I lost my first election for Freshmen Class Representative, but little did I know that in the future, because I continued being active and developed a genuine interest in this organization, I would grow to be Club Secretary, Club President, and now, Division 42 East Lt. Governor of California-Nevada-Hawaii Key Club District of Key Club International. The path of commitment I chose is peculiar to many others. My friends and family could never understand the complete passion that I had with Key Club. What they normally see is an enthusiastic guy who gets stressed and overworked over mindless club work. Clubs to them are just embellishments to put on college applications, which disappoints me greatly as I have expressed my concern over the poor leadership demonstrated in the clubs at my school. I have seen how corrupt people can be; from winning elections due to popularity to starting up clubs just to get the title of \\'Founding Club Officer,\\' these people do not understand the full extent of what it means to be a leader.I stand on a stage in front of a crowd of over two thousand people for our district\\'s annual Fall Rally South event on Saturday, November 14, 2015. This event celebrates everyone\\'s fundraising contributions towards Pediatric Trauma Program, but for me, it was the eight-month milestone of the 2015-2016 Key Club term, celebrating all of the achievements in fundraising, service hours completed, and leadership development in that time span. For me, I serve Division 42 East, a group of nine schools in Ventura County. I am proud to serve these clubs and willing to shout from the top of my lungs on stage to point of falling on stage, which I did. What is there not to be excited about? Every club had increase attendance to this event, raising $1548 in total for PTP (doubling our numbers from the previous year), safely coordinating each and everyone one of their members to and from the event, and celebrating together in high spirits and great respect for one another. I look back on this event, and I feel validated that all of my work in conducting monthly division meetings and training conferences, sending information from international and district board to the clubs, and personally supporting each of the members I serve is worthwhile.2. Describe the world you come from \\\\u2014 for example, your family, community or school \\\\u2014 and tell us how your world has shaped your dreams and aspirations.\\'You know, Kevin,\\' my mom warned me in Vietnamese, \\'back in Vietnam, when my mother told me to lay down to get hit, I would do it quickly without questioning.\\' This is one of the reasons why I love my parents; they have come a long way to modify their Eastern parenting views.It would be wrong for me to just state that I underwent corporal punishment as a child\\\\u2014which I did; however, with such harsh disciplinary views, I had to understand that it is how they express love. To put it into perspective, this was how my parents were raised back in Vietnam. It was always rude to disobey or talk back to an elder, to fight back or avoid punishment, and to dishonor your family. Here in America, we can understand each of these cultural aspects to an extent, but to live strictly by this belief is a life of fear and self-loathing to some people, such as myself.How did I endure this? I remind myself of how valuable my own life is and that everything my parents did is out of care and love. My parents immigrated to America sometime after finishing their high school education. For them, the American dream is to be successful, meaning that they being able to accumulate great wealth and live leisurely. Unfortunately, the reality is that they had to work without a college education to support their family members. Working low-income, physically-strenuous jobs, their dream now lies in me to be successful. Though they understand that perfectionism is not possible, they are persistent in correcting my behavior as much as possible.How did I overcome this? There comes to a point when I cracked and could not handle it anymore; I told them how it affects me personally, how I get depressed, how I start to self-loathe, how I get suicidal thoughts for not being their perfect child. We talked. I remember this day; it was a Saturday during the summer of eighth grade. From that day on, it was just lectures and discussions so that we understand each other perspectives.This experience shaped my mentality greatly as my goal in life is to not be a doctor, lawyer, or engineer anymore, but a person who lives happily, and in being happy comes success\\\\u2014this is my perspective of the American dream. With communication and support from my family, I am able to pursue my self-interests that further my understanding of the world around me.3. Additional Comment:Glaring through the narrow openings of my eyes, a white brilliancy awakened and brought me into consciousness. After a prolonged, isolated slumber, I was exposed to a steady, faint noise. Beep. Beep. Beep. The sound reverberated across my mind as my body slowly regained its senses. A ventilated breeze caressed my body ever so gently as I scrunched a thin linen sheet in search of comfort. Beep. Beep. Beep. Dazed and confused, I started to notice all the capillary tubes and whirring machinery attached to my body. Waking up to this unfamiliar surrounding was bewildering, but what shocked me the most was when I saw my mom lying lifelessly next to the frame of my bed.I recall my psychology teacher explaining the topic of childhood amnesia, saying that it was virtually impossible to recollect memories prior to the age of three or four, saying that everything that we thought and knew as a child is just simply a false memory\\\\u2014a lie\\\\u2014that we manifest with our own imagination, causing us to be self-enamored with what we deem to be ideal. Whether if he meant it seriously, I did not care; this vivid snippet was evoked from my past, and I knew for certain that every detail of that particular moment was accurate, for it was during my traumatizing period with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.Having been diagnosed with Leukemia, I have a different perspective on cancer. The spread of cancer awareness is worse than the spreading of cancer itself. The unnecessary fear and degrading pity that I have faced as a child to now are quite offensive as I faced discrimination due to my outer appearance during chemo therapy and irrational remorse and sympathy for a medical condition. I do understand that it is critical and serious; however, none of it compares to the amount of effort and stress that my parents underwent. If there is any sympathy or remorse that is being shown, it should be directed towards my parents as I feel that I am forever indebted to them for not only giving me life but also saving my life.Burdened with finances and also constantly ensuring that I am living a healthy, normal life, my parents had gone through the worse kind of hardship that I can imagine. They are not well-verse in English; therefore, they are heavily dependent on others, trusting them in their opinions and advices. As I was behind on education due to several missed instructional school days, my parents worried every day about my future. I do not know any other way to give back to my parents than by being independent one day by showing them that I am able to handle my own education and finances, and in turn, one day, I will be able to be at a point when I am able to take care of myself and also my parents in the future. I hope that with a college education, I will be able to pursue in something that challenges but interests me, and will be able to come out a successful person, making my parents proud and letting them know that I am thankful for all that they have done for me.\"}, {\"index\": 455, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 456, \"new_personal_statement\": \"When I think of Athens I can\\'t help but think of my mother\\'s instructions on how to navigate its seemingly impossible traffic. \\'Look for the mountains\\' she\\'d tell me, \\'If your sense of direction fails, the mountains will always be at the exact same place.\\' Perhaps that\\'s why, of all my early memories, these scenes of her driving down small, winding roads, an almost invincible woman, have stayed with me the longest.At that time, I know Athens\\' chaos from the backseat of our family\\'s ten-year old Toyota. My parents are all-knowing: their world is my world, and my world is little more. When it comes to the clutter of the city, its wrathful Mediterranean heat, its winding backstreets, and its soft gradient of anxious graffiti, I take it in as my mother drives me, safely and surely.That is childhood, and like any suspended idyll, it ends. There is a deepening of Greece\\'s crisis. My parents lose their jobs. They give me the \\'we must move to Canada\\' talk in an empty supermarket lot. We move to Canada the same year.My first night in Toronto, I break down in a furnitureless room and cry, unsure of where I am. None of it seems real. At the dairy stall of our local supermarket my mother first puts down a packet of processed cheese because it is too expensive. Once-soft whispers evolve to bedroom arguments about finances and rent. My parents put in night shift, and work minimum wage. They jump between jobs that challenge their previous identities.For the first time, I see my parents unsure of where we\\'re headed. That banal comfort -- of financial security, of perfectly knowing the language that\\'s spoken around you, of having friends, family, acquaintances, even the mountains -- is lost. Those moments of obscure family comfort, where my mother knows better -- and all I have to do is ask -- are lost.That year I, too, feel lost. I don\\'t learn to navigate this world instantly, but I do accept that it\\'s up to me to learn how to. I join the school board\\'s student consultations looking for a window to the rest of the city. I walk into a room of loud conversation uncertain of how much of a right I, a newcomer, might have to voice an opinion. I discover that there is Hamima, who wants to open up trustee elections to underage students; Nelia who thinks there should be a process by which students can appeal for more funding for their projects. There is Zakariyah, who challenges everyone and everything.There are hundreds of students with opinions that straddle all sides of the ideological mosaic and I can choose to listen and learn from them. It is in those after school library discussions about students\\' voices, in those Sunday morning meetings, in late nights spent drafting newspaper articles about austerity, in the tales shared between me and my friends about migration and family lineages, that something clicks: this city begins to feel shared and open, like a home.I have since pondered about my mother\\'s tendency to navigate using mountains, and what the memory might mean to me. The mountains were her means of gaining her directions in a city that seemed maze-like to my unseasoned eye. But my remembrance has also taken on a metaphorical sense: my mother had chosen a means of getting around that relentless, chaotic city that was most natural for her. I must now choose mine.My mountains are not simple landmarks physically lining the horizon. They take the form of people, ideas, questions I\\'d love to explore, this newfound sense of community. And that\\'s fine. I am no longer living in my mother\\'s Athens. I don\\'t wish to recapture an easy childhood.

But mostly, it was Stage One: The Immature Child.The noble journey had started earlier, when I was eight. Our old and spectacled librarian made us read a book every week. She claimed that she had read all the books on the shelves, and would be able to identify those who didn\\'t read. At 65, she probably wasn\\'t interested in Nancy Drew\\'s, but gullible as we were, we believed her anyway. So to complement my increasing workload as a 3rd grader, I started engaging in intensive reading. I read on the way to school, on the way back, at the lunch table, at the dinner table, and next to my bedside lamp before I fell asleep.

Every crevice in my apartment holds a reminder that my home isn\\'t permanent and in another couple of years, we\\'ll move again. 5 different homes. 7 different schools.When I was little, I used to live in a house that my childhood imagination recreated as a palace. One day, in the first grade, I came home from school and I saw someone driving away with our barbecue. I didn\\'t understand at the time, but we were selling it because barbecues don\\'t fit in apartments. We were moving again.A new home meant a new school. And trying to constantly fit in as \\'the new girl\\' was difficult.When I came home from school, my parents were absent. They had just bought a fast food restaurant, trying their hardest to reach the American Dream\\\\u2014which would later leave them in $70,000 of debt. They worked there everyday from 9 am to 10 pm. And I was left in the care of whichever relative that was available.It was lonely. And as a sensitive child, I hid behind my couch so my younger siblings wouldn\\'t see me cry.I remember vividly, I was performing at my school\\'s holiday show and I looked to the sea of smiling faces in front of me, but I purposely didn\\'t look for the two faces I knew I wouldn\\'t see. There were more performances, more competitions, more awards. And I still chose not to look.Although I didn\\'t realize it at the time, my independance was being carefully forged every time I became \\'the new girl\\', every time I had a performance or competition, every time I tucked my siblings into bed because my parents weren\\'t home, every time my dad would leave for months at a time. The experiences I had forced me to become adaptable and independent. I learned very quickly that if I didn\\'t work for what I wanted, no one would hand me anything. I learned I couldn\\'t go through life waiting for recognition or a pat on the back every time I did something commendable. Crying behind the couch became a thing of the past.And moving to places with different cultures and different backgrounds made me comfortable with change. I\\'ve come to welcome differences rather than fear them. I\\'ve learned to embrace challenges without crumbling under the pressure. Becoming \\'the new girl\\' is no longer something to fear. It\\'s an opportunity to start fresh and continue to add onto the knowledge and wisdom that I\\'ve learned from every other time I was \\'the new girl.\\'I\\'ve also cultivated my own drive and my own passions. With no one telling me what I should do, I pursued everything that I wanted. And I\\'ve seen what happens when you\\'re deprived of an education. My family were refugees from the Cambodian Genocide and they didn\\'t have the privilege of an education.

Scroll to the bottom to learn more about my choice of topic, some strategies I used, and advice specifically about writing your personal statement\\'HEY!\\'I tensed immediately. Was there a robbery? Was the building burning down? Suddenly, a wizened pair of eyes were peering up at me from behind a pair of glasses.\\'My name is Josie, I will be your manager today. Nice to meet you.\\'Nothing about her tone of voice sounded nice. Before I could get a word out, I was instructed to grab a pen and paper. My trembling hands did as they were told.The list went on and on, from \\'facing\\' (organizing the entire store), to checking the expiration date on every grocery item, to taking out the trash. The only task her list did not encompass was helping customers, and long lines kept me at the counter most of the night. Despite working myself to the bone and still failing to finish in time, she made no attempt to hide her disappointment. \\'You need to work on your facing. I saw three shampoo bottles and two tins of formula that weren\\'t straightened.\\' As if this were her way of saying goodnight, she locked up the store and went on her way.I left work crushed with the absolute certainty that I was the worst CVS employee that had ever lived. Amidst my 16 year old melodrama, I was convinced that she would fire me within the week.But I didn\\'t get fired, and after more than a year of working with Josie, I can say that I am better for it.In the months following, I spoke with many colleagues and customers who have had similar experiences. I was not being singled out; I was not alone. I eventually came to the realization that I am not the worst CVS employee to have ever lived. I am a good employee. While I do make mistakes, all that I can do is learn from them and improve in the future.Working with Josie taught me confidence. Working with her night after night has taught me not to show weakness. I have learned to match her vigor with my own, to meet her blunt criticisms with an acknowledgement of my mistakes and a promise of improvement. Confidence does not mean being perfect, confidence is the ability to stand by both your accomplishments and mistakes with equal determination to improve.Working with Josie taught me that work worth doing is worth doing well. If I am honest with myself, I did not take my job incredibly seriously before meeting Josie. At the time, I was new enough to not know everything but young enough to think that I did. I was just a teenager looking to make a few bucks after school, and CVS was just a bullet point on my long list of activities and responsibilities. I realized that Josie\\'s harsh criticisms come from a drive to do the very best work she can do. She holds extremely high standards for herself, her employees, and her store, and she excels at what she does. Working with Josie has infused some of her drive into my own life, helping me to excel at all of my other bullet points, from cleaning my room to starting a church choir. Whatever I am doing, I have a drive and a demand for excellence that can take me wherever I want to go.I haven\\'t stopped working hard, and Josie has noticed. She has confided in me from time to time; I have even seen her laugh! But no recognition or award has ever come close to the pride I felt when she commented one Friday night:\\'You even faced the toothbrushes! Good girl!\\'_________________________________________When Writing this essay, I really wanted to highlight an extracurricular activity that I was super involved and passionate about, but was\\'t exactly my crowning achievement. The way I see it, major awards and honors speak for themselves, so I chose to focus my essays on things that wouldn\\'t jump off the page at first glance, but actually reveal a lot about me as a person. The whole aim of this essay is to reveal who YOU are, and instead of finding some revolutionary new topic or compelling sob story, I basically tried to find a setting in which I could \\'Show NOT Tell\\' who I really am.As for the essay itself, I tried to infuse some humor and comedy into it, poking fun at my own melodrama and convey a sense of self awareness and retrospective maturity. In writing this about my boss (who is still my boss by the way), I really made sure not to seem bitter or cast her too harshly, which is a complex balance to find in such a limited amount of space. Instead, I found the fault within myself, again displaying that maturity and perceptiveness that I was going for. I made sure to end it with a cute conclusion, though, highlighting at once the ridiculous extremes of her standards, as well as my triumphant ability to meet them.

Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?Strawberries and cream. Crisp white attire on a summer\\'s day. 130 mph serves. These are some things that attracted me to the game of tennis at a young age. Since then, I\\'ve learned many lessons on the court, but I\\'ve also learned much from the time I have spent with the red, 25-pound behemoth that is my stringing machine.With one hand over and the other under, I push the octagonal string across the stringbed. Using my thumb and index finger, I weave the string over one main string, under the next until it reaches the black grommet hole. Using a pair of nose pliers, I gently nudge the string through. Pulling the rest out, I wrap the excess string around the tensioner and let the drop weight fall. Taking a floating clamp, I clamp the string as close to the grommet as possible to minimize tension loss. Over under, over under, the process becomes methodical. Within twenty minutes, I am pulling tension on the twentieth cross and tying it off with the help of a pathfinder awl. As I snip off the excess string, what was once a bare tennis racket now has sixteen strings running down its stringbed and twenty across.It wasn\\'t always this straightforward. At first, I didn\\'t even want to string my own rackets, let alone those of others, but when I broke strings every two months, paying forty dollars for a string job became financially taxing. Thus, I purchased a stringing machine not for personal enjoyment but for necessity.My first stringing experience was largely unsuccessful. I experienced frustration when there wasn\\'t enough string to tie off the mains. I groaned when I failed to skip grommet hole 8H. I angrily stomped my foot when I forgot to clamp the starting crosses. At the end of a three hour session, out came a racket, looking like a fishnet, with several misweaves and a messy tie-off. I couldn\\'t have been happier; I took to social media for a status update.Stringing has taught me a lot by showing me my faults while broadening my horizons. I have had to think critically when mishaps occur. No longer do I muscle a string through a blocked grommet. Instead, a gentle nudge is the key. If one cross string breaks in a two-piece job, I no longer restring the entire racket, just the crosses.Stringing has also led me to research when the basic stringer\\'s manual could no longer answer my questions. For instance, did you know that polyester string itself cannot impart greater rpms than traditional tennis string? The reason is its stiffness and low power potential. By allowing players to swing out more, polyester string promotes faster racket head speed, which helps generate greater spin. Furthermore, natural gut made from thin ribbons of beef intestine is the best in terms of playability because its triple helix structure provides greater elasticity and cushioning than synthetic string made from nylon.The skills I have learned in stringing have also pertained to my everyday life. When finding limits to differential equations, I no longer use brute force. Instead, over and under is the way to go. Cancelling out like terms and multiplying by conjugates can make even the most monstrous equation into a friendly one. When the trimmer line in our lawnmower ran out, I used a thick gauged tennis string as a substitute instead of buying new trimmer line and it cut the grass just as well.What started as three-hour stringing sessions have been shortened to forty minutes. What started as ten feet of wasted string has been reduced to three. What started as one poorly strung racket has become thirty properly strung rackets. From those thirty, my stringing skills will continue to improve, as will the way I tackle the challenges ahead of me.\"}, {\"index\": 461, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Born to a Venezuelan dad, who has lived and breathed f\\\\u00fatbol his whole life, and a Dutch Indonesian mother, from a family of huge fans of Holland\\'s international soccer team, I have been kicking a ball since the day I could stand.

It was a Saturday night around one a.m., and my granny said, \\'Come down here with me.\\' She was sleeping on a brown mattress on the carpeted floor next to me because she had recently fallen out of bed. Earlier that week she was having hallucinations, signs that we thought were pointing toward Alzheimer\\'s disease. I knew she was scared, so I got out of my bed and lay down next to her. I kissed her on the forehead and gave her a hug and told her that everything is going to be alright. She replied, \\'Ok baby\\' and started to fall back to sleep.The rest of that night, and every night after that, she talked loudly in her sleep. Her voice echoed throughout the lonely house in a low, growly tone. It was not her normally sweet voice. It had me tossing and turning all night. I never woke her because I knew she was more tired than I was, but I would be so tired from not sleeping that I would sleep through the day. I had college classes and extracurricular obligations to take care of, but my mom needed my help taking care of her. When my mom was not in that room sleeping with her and keeping her company, I was.I have always been close to my granny. My granny is naturally a sweet person, but when she fell ill she became bitter and frustrated. She started to use a vicious tone when she spoke to me. It was a rough time for my family, adjusting to having my grandmother with us. We could barely buy groceries for ourselves, and now we had another mouth to feed. But it is a value that we hold that family takes care of family.During much of the time she was with us, my granny was bedridden, which made caring for her a time-consuming job. If my granny was hungry, I would get her food. I made sure she was bathed daily, and made she her waste was properly taken care of. That was hard, but the hardest thing was that I hated seeing her in that position. I know that my granny was ashamed because I had to take care of her like that. I realized at some point that I was working harder than I ever had before, and it was because I was doing it out of love.I used to think that being responsible was important-- responsible people do what they are supposed to do even when it\\'s hard. But my grandma taught me that being responsible is not enough, you have do everything you do with compassion and a higher purpose. As a prospective economics major looking to work in the business world, compassion will not only help me work with different types of people in different environments, which is necessary in today\\'s global economy, but will also guide me to not only focus on profitability and efficiency, but ethics.

I don\\'t have any friends!\\' cried one of my second-grade science class students. I was about to give the empty consolation of \\'I\\'m sure somebody likes you,\\' but then I remembered how I felt when I was his age. And I remembered what happened at Bird Camp.    The previous summer, when I was sixteen, I had spent a week learning the basics of birding alongside a handful of young, knowledgeable, and arrogant birders, and I had every expectation of fitting in with that group of people who shared my unusual trait: an obsession with birds. But I was quickly singled out for having spent the previous year working in a bird store that specialized in parrots. \\'If we see see any parakeets in the trees, be sure to identify them for us,\\' mocked George, the program coordinator. I didn\\'t know the key to this social circle was recognizing the call of a chipping sparrow, or gossiping about which outlandish eBird reports were sure to be rejected. I wondered if I should quit, go home to my pet cockatiels, and quit trying to be a Wild Bird Person altogether.   But I didn\\'t. The next morning I woke up at five o\\'clock to search for prothonotary warblers in a swamp on the outskirts of a farm, wearing a sunhat that everyone said made me look like I was about to go on a safari\\\\u2013 I just wanted to avoid a sunburn. I soon discovered the depths of encyclopedic knowledge the other birders had of forest dwelling species, and made the blunder of trying to compare my story of the time Dickens the cockatoo ate a moth to their tales of finding whip-poor-wills late at night. It soon became clear that I was not a part of the flock.   On the third day, when my inexperience no longer weighed me down, I got lost in a cornfield while on a quest for wood ducks. It was the perfect time to think about how in the past three days, my socks had been soaked through with mud, I was heavily perfumed with a mix of sweat and bug spray, I got hives twice from a beagle named Crazy Bailey, and I saw a baby vulture in the second floor of an abandoned barn nicknamed the Haint House. Just because I hadn\\'t immediately made a bunch of friends didn\\'t mean I wasn\\'t having a memorable adventure. Still, it stung that when I finally returned to the group, I was greeted with an indifferent \\'Hi Mady.\\' Nobody realized I had been gone.   One fateful moment at Bird Camp came on the night we spent on a stretch of country road listening for owls. We pulled up in the bus riddled with fly carcasses from the swamp and tumbled out as quietly as we could. As I crept along the gravel, I spotted a trash bag turned loose in the grass, and I scanned the trees until I saw the telltale beady eyes staring back at me. \\'I found a screech owl!\\' My peers applauded my discovery: I had finally proven myself to them. Raising my binoculars, I looked closer and realized it was just a baby raccoon. I let out the breath I didn\\'t know I was holding, allowing my heart to sink briefly before continuing on. That week, although I never had the chance to prove myself to others, I was able to shake off the dirt and keep going, and I had proven to myself that I was strong.    \\'You know what, William?\\' I responded, my mind back in science club. \\'It\\'s alright if not everyone likes you. You\\'ll be much happier if you don\\'t sacrifice doing what you love for the sake of fitting in. The right friends will love you for who you are, even if they\\'re feathered and chirpy.\\' His tears dried, and we returned to class.\"}, {\"index\": 464, \"new_personal_statement\": \"My parents and grandparents have always inspired me to improve on what previous generations have laid as a foundation for us. My grandparents, who were born and raised in Mexico, did not have access to educational opportunities such as those in the United States. At a young age, they were both expected to work in the fields in order to contribute to the families\\' financial needs. Despite only having a second grade education, my grandfather worked hard and saved along the years. My grandmother worked just as hard as a stay at home mother raising seven children. With no one to give my father academic advice, he was the first to graduate college and has since received three master\\'s degrees. My mother has recently obtained her master\\'s degree in special education. They have raised me with the values of hard work and improving on our previous generation\\'s foundation. Attending college and working towards a career in medicine and engineering, I feel that I will live up to the values that my background has instilled in me. As a young child I loved building puzzles, and that continues today. I enjoyed sitting at the table for hours focusing on finding that one critical piece. I would love to see each piece make what seemed like a huge contribution to the overall dynamics of the process and the picture. I have found science, the most challenging puzzle of all, because you have to figure it out on your own and it takes critical and analytical thinking. Puzzles taught me the merits of cooperative learning. My grandmother used to help me find the border pieces while I would fit them into making the frame. This is similar to my lab partners helping me to measure out the necessary chemicals to use during experiments. As I became older and better versed with puzzles, I committed myself more in terms of time and attention to details. The process was very important. I would first make the border by searching for the pieces with straight edges and putting them together. Then, I would look for pieces with similar colors and try to form chunks of the puzzle this way. This is very similar to science in which there is a process to the madness of completing labs. If there is one step out of order it may not work as optimally as hoped, it may take longer to figure out, or it may not work at all. Process is a very important part of science, by having a process the experiment can come together in the quickest and easiest way. Missing pieces were bound to happen with a dog who ate anything and a vicious vacuum. However, these pieces taught me an important lesson. Often, nothing ever happens the way it is supposed to be. Second, it taught me that although you might think something is done there is always something more you can do. This is very important in science because of the way that everything that is done to advance the field is something that can be expounded on. I think the most important thing puzzles did for me was make me more inquisitive. Instead of being given a set of instructions that told me exactly which pieces went where, I got a rough sketch and had to work from there. It was challenging at times, but when it was finished it was nice to know that I had put in all of this work to form something beautiful. I think the lessons learned will always stay with me. I am always curious about the next thing; I find myself not taking things at face value. I am always questioning and trying to find ways to do things differently and make it more efficient. This is why I am excited for college, I hope to answer current questions and pose some of my own.\"}, {\"index\": 465, \"new_personal_statement\": \"If my life were a play, there would be two sets, two acts, and two sets of characters. Like many first-generation Americans, I was born in the US to immigrant parents who spoke a foreign language, cooked foreign foods, and lived a foreign lifestyle in a crime-ridden community on the \\'wrong side\\' of the SEPTA tracks. But, unlike my neighbors, I was shipped away. Although my journey technically began in a small apartment in Manhattan, I have always considered the first chapter of my life to have taken place in rural China. My world back then was full of rice paddies and long solo explorations through woods of bamboo on my small bicycle outfitted with rickety wooden training wheels. There were no other kids my age, so I spent my time running and riding around the fields and enjoying the marvels nature had to offer. As a small and clueless child, I thought that was how life would always be: full of greenery and slow days in the sun on my rusty bicycle. However, when I was five, my Fuzhou explorations came to a close, and so did act one.Act two placed me, a scared little boy with no knowledge of English or memory of America, 20,000 miles away to live with my parents and an assortment of other restaurant workers on a communal floor above a Chinese restaurant in North Philadelphia. On my new stage, I spent my time upstairs learning English from a problem-solving show called \\'Cyberchase\\', which spurred my future interest in math and science, while my parents worked long shifts over vats of boiling oil and woks full of General Tso\\'s Chicken in the \\'Happy Garden Inn\\' below. I often grew tired of being alone, so I found myself escaping to spend most of my days in the restaurant, sliding around on my stomach atop barrels of sugar and causing trouble whenever it got too quiet. Although it was peaceful inside my fortress of familiar smells and Fuzhounese culture, the outside world was dark and sinister. My unusual habits from China and lack of English made me easy prey for elementary school bullies, and I found it painfully difficult to continue being the carefree child that I was in China. Instead of learning to share and appreciate my differences, I became resentful of my roots and tried to change myself in hopes of deterring the random \\'ching chongs\\' and bullies telling me to go back where I came from.What saved me from that hostile world was Quaker education. In second grade, my parents transferred me to a small nearby Quaker school called Frankford Friends. I initially thought that nothing would change except for the faces of my tormentors, but I soon learned how wrong that sentiment was. For the first time, I had people who I could call friends. Instead of making fun of my cultural background, they encouraged me to share my story, and in turn they shared theirs with me. Looking back, I now realize that without Frankford Friends I would be a completely different person. Unlike other theologically based models, Quaker education does not lecture its students on how to be \\'good Quakers\\'. Rather, it aims to instill values. This foundation helped shape who I am today by demonstrating the importance of community, stewardship, integrity, and equality. It was also this foundation that allowed me to eventually accept not only my own culture, but also embrace the diversity around me.I spent my adolescence struggling between labeling myself as an American-born Chinese and attempting to find my own identity. Now, each day I find myself conversing in multiple tongues\\\\u2014English, Spanish, Mandarin and my native language Fuzhounese\\\\u2014while feeling comfortable with myself and who I have become. I am now much older, but my world is still set with the same scene, my play awaiting a third act soon to come.\"}, {\"index\": 466, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Parker Road Station.This was the last stop on my way back from work. My first day of work, in fact. How did I feel? Well, a little overwhelmed, pretty accomplished too, but mostly proud of myself for making it through the day.Over the summer, I found a position as a research intern at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. For me it was a valuable opportunity to leave the nest and test my wings in a more challenging setting. Unlike the odd jobs that had earned me pocket money before, this job was more formal, more official. In the professional environment of the Human Resources Department, I politely endured through employee training, received an ID badge and learned how to clock in hours. Throughout this whole alien process, a growing sense of responsibility slowly unfurled within me\\\\u2014but so did a feeling of eager anticipation.Swallowed by the enormous building, I felt small and lost as doctors in lab coats and business people carrying briefcases passed me by while I tried to locate my new lab. But upon meeting my professor and the research team, I slowly began to feel more confident. Despite our huge age gaps, my lab-mates provided the familiar setting of friendly collaboration that reminded me of group projects from school. Even on my first day, no one cut me any slack for being young. In order to compensate for my lack of knowledge in the field, I fervently studied past literature and approached the more-experienced lab members for help understanding difficult topics. My mentor patiently but firmly explained foreign concepts to me and taught me how to use the equipment. It was simultaneously reassuring and overwhelming to know that I would be treated as an adult and expected to act like one.After a morning of intense productivity, I observed that the industrious atmosphere lessened as my colleagues ate lunch and discussed the news and their families. Before, they had been the distant \\'adults,\\' but I began to realize that they were just normal human beings like me. And although they appeared to be ordinary, average people, I was encouraged to know that they were making great contributions to society through their work. Inspired by their passionate dedication and determination, I resolved learn as much as I could and supplement their efforts with my own results soon.Leaving work that first day, I paid the train fare and boarded the DART, which was packed with other people headed for home. When I finally found a seat, I felt honored to be among the many men and women on the train who worked at the medical center as well. These people experienced the 8 hour work day and commuted by train just as I had. Although for me it was just a summer experience, this daily pattern was their life, and the lives of countless other adults in the world. Sitting inconspicuously on the train among the other passengers, perhaps there was a scientist who had contributed towards the curing of cancer, or a nurse who had helped to deliver a baby, or a business executive who had sealed a huge transaction for his company. Unrecognized heroes of society sat all around me. Would I join their ranks someday? In just 24 hours, I had experienced both the independence and responsibility that came with the grown-up world. While I was reluctant to let go of my carefree, unrestrained childhood, I was also excited and looked forward to facing society. Soon, I would be accountable for my own life, no longer dependent on my family.The train speaker sounded.\\'Parker Road Station. This is the final destination.\\'No. For me, it was only the beginning.\"}, {\"index\": 467, \"new_personal_statement\": \" \\'Mom, I\\'m gay,\\' I whispered quietly into her ear. I had waited three years to tell her in the hopes that she would understand, but she did not. Instead, she told me I was an abomination, and at that time I was fragile, so I believed her. Feeling terrible about myself, I fell into depression and gave up on school during the seventh grade. After failing all my classes that year, I began to hate school. However, when I realized that allowing my mother\\'s words to affect me negatively would only lead to my demise, I renewed my focus on school, my grades improved, and they have been excellent ever since. Although at first words hurt me, they ultimately taught me courage and prepared me to fight ignorance and injustice.My love for the written word helped me learn courage. I vividly remember my first time walking down the dusty, opaque hallways of Newark\\'s Public Library. I picked up a stack of tattered and neglected books that, in many ways, reminded me of myself. I read the books in silence, inspired by each word I read. Each of the characters in the novels displayed courage that I hoped to embody. Percy Jackson fought valiantly against the Titan scourge, and Esmeralda Santiago fought against the American invasion of Mac\\\\u00fan. Reading the accounts of their courage invited me to be courageous, so I began to speak out. I told my social worker about my dire situation, and she contacted my father. This courage also translated to my studies. I had previously been shy in class, but as I felt empowered by my new found courage, I began raising my hand to participate and ask questions about things I did not understand. More than authority figures, I began to see my teachers as a source of support and encouragement. The courage to build relationships with my teachers and the power of the words we have shared helped my scholarship grow tremendously.My love for the spoken word also helped me prepare to speak out against ignorance and injustice. When my newly-found courage led me to join the debate club, my love for the written word was fed, as I read about the intersections between public policy and discrimination based on race, gender, and sexual preference. Reading and understanding the information was fairly easy for me, but the oral presentation required for debates was very challenging. To improve, I practiced incessantly. I worked with the upperclassmen on the debate team and I stayed after practice with my coach three days a week for three hours each day to prepare for my debates. With their help, I learned how to deliver oral arguments with the right cadence and tone to ensure my arguments were clear and concise. Though the advice my peers and coach gave me helped me tremendously, hearing their encouragement and support meant the world to me. Because of them, I developed the confidence I needed to present oral arguments that advocate for the marginalized and disenfranchised, and my passion for fighting against ignorance and injustice was born.Because of my hard work and the great support I have received, I have become a successful student who takes full advantage of every course and extracurricular opportunity. The tremendous impact that the positive words of other have had on me inspired me to become a mentor for my middle and high school debate teams, which has allowed me to share the support and encouragement that was given to me with others. Ultimately, I am grateful that the curse my mother\\'s words placed over my life has been broken by the words in my favorite novels, in my policy debates, and from my peers, teachers, and debate coach. These positive words and the courage they taught me have thus become my weapons of choice in the fight against ignorance and injustice.\"}, {\"index\": 468, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Tabula rasa, a term coined by John Locke meaning \\'blank slate\\' or to me, the perfect way to describe how I began investing. My venture began one morning as I shuffled across the shaggy carpet lining of my parent\\'s bedroom over to my father\\'s laptop. Out of curiosity, I peered over his shoulder to see a magnificent display of red, green, and black that still never ceases to amaze me. I asked him what the protruding symbols and words meant to which I received a lengthy reply, but in short he informed me it was his trading platform. Being just eleven at the time, I had no idea what a trader did, but I was determined to find out. Over the next few weeks, I was persistent. At every chance I got, I pounced, quickly bombarding my father with questions, asking for education on the art of trading. Eventually he cracked and allowed me to have a small experience in the world of investing. He allocated funds to buy ten shares of whatever company I desired and I decided to invest in GameStop. At the time, my infantile reasoning thought because kids often purchased video games, a video game store was sure to succeed. Luckily for me, that ideology was correct. Looking back on that moment, I realize how naive I was in my adolescence. I made a purchase on the basis of faulty reasoning without any analysis on the company I bought into. Nevertheless, it was a good foundation to begin with as it sparked my interest. From there I began allocating my time towards learning the inner mechanisms of my favorite companies, watching as my theories came to life, and staying up until the crack of dawn in anticipation of the clock chiming 6:30, the markets open in California. While other boys spent their time incessantly engulfed in typical pastimes, I honed my investing skills and studied up on the wavering market until finally my ability was recognized by TastyTrade, one of the largest financial networks in the world. It was then I realized that my simple hobby became my greatest talent.Over half of Americans have zero dollars in the stock market. To me, that fact was outright appalling. Never had I imagined almost every other person in my beloved country was either too afraid or lacked the knowledge to apply such a necessary skill. Even I, a lowly adolescent, has the ability to invest what little income I possess and make it grow to amounts far beyond my ability to generate from a job. It was because of this lack of financial capability in the world I was spurred to take action.   Starting with my school, I began an investment club, teaching the basics and informing my fellow students of the wonders of putting money in the stock market. What shocked me was how eager my fellow classmates were to learn. On the first day of the inauguration of our club, the entire classroom was packed. Although my legs quivered from the stares of thirty other kids, I was actually relieved. Not physically of course, fright still overtook me then, but mentally I was ecstatic. I realized people wanted to learn, but their fear of how complicated the market seemed at first glance was hindering their willingness to take their first leap over the hurdle of investment education. From this realization, I felt the need to change that perception of investing. In order to teach others to invest, I first needed to make investing simple and appealing. What ensued from my hours of pondering and scheming to make this idea bloom into fruition was a youtube series. On this channel, I sought to provide the basics of investing in simple everyday terms using relatable examples and artistic animations to captivate my audience. While I did let the videos manifest views on their own, I also actively sought out camps and clinics to present and inform others of the wonders of investing. From my efforts, I was able to give the public a glimpse into a world many people would never have thought about discovering. When asked what subject kids hate the most, the majority of students will say math. However, for me I\\'m the exact opposite. From the very moment I began school, math has always had a special hold on me. There\\'s something about wrapping your head around a problem, trying out different ideas, and finally coming up with a solution that makes math so enticing. I just love the sensation that takes over me when I\\'m trapped in thought, constantly wondering how I can solve a problem. This fondness for the ever so hated subject has lead me to pursue higher learning in its effervescent realm.  My first instance of expanding my mathematical knowledge was upon learning of competitive math. I felt complete being able to struggle and overcome the mental challenges competitive math presented to me, learning its intricate patterns, and finally succeeding in conquering its posed obstacles. I spent countless hours preparing and learning to see it payoff in the form of an individual bronze medal and a team silver medal in my city\\'s Mathcounts competition as well as qualifying for the American Invitational Mathematics Exam in high school three years in a row.  Although my school\\'s competitive math teams were quite indulging, I still desired to satiate my brain\\'s appetite for stimulation leading me to join the Berkeley Math Circle as well as my school\\'s Mathlete club. These two organizations allowed me to expand my mathematical knowledge to depths I could never have dreamed of achieving. They completely changed my thought process, opening me up to new ways of viewing the world while introducing me to extraordinary analytical concepts. My mind began to process issues more deeply than it had ever done so before. I perceived the usage of mathematics in my everyday life and solved my problems with cold calculated precision all thanks to its guidance.  Over a million people in the United States alone are named Kevin. Clearly, my name is not unique. However, just like how every one of these other \\'Kevins\\' has a distinct fingerprint, I have a disparate personality. I yearn to help others, out of compassion, empathy, and the warm fuzzy feeling you get inside when you know you\\'ve made a difference in someone else\\'s life. Whether it be from giving a few dollars to someone less fortunate on the street to creating nonprofit organizations in the pursuit of spreading my knowledge, I find that as long as I try to do something, someone out there will benefit from my efforts. I\\'ve seen how the other half lives. Constituting my travels around the globe from my competitive fencing events to vacationing, I\\'ve had the privilege of observing the diverse cultures of the world while also being exposed to the conditions of the economically deprived. I\\'ve wondered so long on what difference I can make in my own town to relieve the grief stricken citizens of the world, but realized to even begin to help humanity I must first help those around me. Whenever possible, I apply this idea to my everyday life by educating others on what I know through my experiences.I\\'ve spent countless hours at my fencing club, volunteering to coach the future generation of stars as well as founding my educative series on investing to help bridge the income gap. In doing so, I\\'ve found a way to return what I\\'ve learned from others back unto the people. I believe through the UC system I can continue to cater to my philosophy by obtaining a world class education which I can then use to help benefit those who might need my assistance. \"}, {\"index\": 469, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Winter break, funnel cake. Ferris wheel\\\\u2026 no deal? But I had planned on riding it for a year! \\'It\\'s too cold, you kids will freeze,\\' dad said. The California night was cool. \\'It\\'s probably closed anyways,\\' mom said. The Ferris wheel was spinning and mocking us.\\'You might get electrocuted, haven\\'t you heard stories about Ferris wheel accidents?\\' dad added. I became unhinged.\\'This is why you won\\'t let me go on Global Glimpse; you guys are afraid of everything and are always imagining the worst!\\' I blurted. Earlier in the school year, I was nominated for and accepted to Global Glimpse, a Latin American summer immersion and leadership program designed to expose students to life in a developing country. I wanted to seize this opportunity to make my summer worthwhile. However, my family disapproved of my summer plan for reasons ranging from snakes to diseases to scary strangers. They thought it was too risky.When I saw that my dad was shooting down the planned Ferris wheel ride, I couldn\\'t help but relate to how similar it was to Global Glimpse. Uncharacteristically, I, the quiet \\'it\\'s alright\\' kid, lashed out. It must\\'ve been the funnel cake. I missed out on the Ferris wheel, and I accepted that I might not go on Global Glimpse.Shortly after, we went inside our hotel and up the mesmerizing glass elevator. Moments later, I went into my aunt\\'s room to help my cousin with her homework. They both firmly believed that going on Global Glimpse will get me kidnapped or fatally ill. I helped her do research on my laptop, but every once in awhile, I would glance at Global Glimpse\\'s website, specifically at the safety and payment pages. Eventually I found myself juggling between tabs about the industrial revolution and Global Glimpse. My research on Global Glimpse led me to believe that contrary to my family\\'s belief, this trip isn\\'t a one-way ticket to disease and death. At midnight, it was time for me to rendezvous with my parents at our nearby room.After exchanging pleasantries, I took a shower in preparation for sleep. The shower was amazing, and it left me in a tranquil state. Then of course the first thing that parents talk to me about once I exit is Global Glimpse. Goodbye Mr. Tranquil State, I hope to see you soon in the near future. \\'I want to talk to you about summer,\\' my dad said.\\'I don\\'t need to go, I can find something else,\\' I told my dad.\\'No, I am letting you go,\\' he replied to me, catching me off-guard. He went on to deliver a long monologue to me about why he made his decision. He said something along the lines of \\'Willy, you are an adult now and I want you to make your own choices and learn from your mistakes. Yelling at me outside really hurt my feelings. I already emailed your teacher to let her know my decision. Now, this essay has a 650 word limit, so stop wasting words on me.\\' I could\\'ve used some funnel cake or another shower, because I had trouble sleeping that night.Fast forward 8 months. Many things have happened since I didn\\'t ride the Ferris wheel. My family never fully committed to Global Glimpse, so I created a mnemonic out of airplane and hockey numbers to memorize my dad\\'s credit card information as a fail-safe. Unfortunately that still isn\\'t enough to pay for college tuition.Gratefully, I ended up going to the Dominican Republic for an amazing 18 days. I witnessed the joys of hospitality and companionship coupled with the miseries of poverty and corruption. This experience gave me inalienable inspiration to make the most of life, and I am proud of the choices that got me here. Soon, I am going to ride on a Ferris wheel and it isn\\'t going to kill me.I can breed koalas with turtles and I can eat ice cream with friends in North Korea. This is all possible due to the power of Photoshop. Photoshop is like a straw that allows people\\'s eyes to drink from my imagination. I can make anything and put it anywhere; from sea monsters in the ocean to winged toasters at my birth. For nearly four years, I have used Photoshop to express myself in an adventurous way, one that offers me wider avenues than music or writing do. I am constantly improving my photoshopping abilities and therefore expanding the limits of my expression.I started off doing simple things like smashing text with copy/pasted images to make propaganda showing that the Boston Massacre wasn\\'t really a massacre for a class debate and now I am creating hypothetical flags for the 2016 Parade of Nations by altering screenshots of the 2012 parade. I don\\'t only use these powers for leisure, like by creating Kurtles (endangered Koala/Turtle hybrids), placing my teacher\\'s face on Jay Jay the Jet Plane, and having my assistant principal fight off Somali Pirates, but I also use Photoshop for academics by creating visuals to add a spicy kick to my documents and presentations. I\\'ve used Photoshop for education most for my Spanish projects throughout the years, where visual aids can greatly help an audience of 20-or-so non-native speakers understand my Spanish tales. One of my projects was to predict the future of my partner, and so I photoshopped him into uncomfortable marriage and hospital situations. The most I\\'ve used Photoshop during a Spanish project was during an assignment to create a children\\'s story. My story was about a stubborn boy who did not eat his vegetables, then at midnight, those vegetables turned into monsters and destroyed his house, so finally he had to live under a bridge with his mom. I had almost 30 photoshopped visuals for that project, and I think it shows off the vitality of my creativity. Photoshop allows me to conjure visuals from my imagination, from lettuce headgear to perhaps an acceptance letter.As a freshman, I joined my high-school\\'s roller hockey team during its inaugural year. Even though I have never before touched a stick or even skated, I had tons of fun learning and playing with the team. I was on good terms with all of my teammates, but the tension between other players was noticeable. We frequently had meetings to discuss the internal conflict within our team, especially among the upperclassmen. During all of this in-fighting, I was a bystander. This bickering amongst ourselves continued until the end of my sophomore year. Our team was mediocre, and to the frustration of my teammates, we lost the majority of our games. This frustration led to blame, which led to criticism, and eventually created conflict. At the end of the second season, a void in leadership was created when our team\\'s leaders graduated. During this time, my coach and the graduating leaders gave me the position of \\'captain.\\' As luxurious as it sounds, my role was to basically send email reminders for games, recruit members at club fair, and ensure that my team remains registered within the league. On the rink and in the locker room, the conflict remained, especially with the current seniors. Honestly, I was afraid to step up and confront the upperclassmen, so I remained a bystander. I finally felt like a true leader when the playoffs came. Our internal conflicts caused our goalie to abandon us, and nobody wanted to fill in. However, I felt that as a leader, it was my responsibility to take one for the team, so I volunteered. It was my first game as goalie, and we won the game in a huge upset against the school that was better funded and statistically superior in every way. Ever since I donned the glove, blocker, and pads, I transformed from being the quietest person on the rink to the most vocal. I set the emotional tone for my team and eventually worked to put an end to the arguing. Now that I am a senior, I will truly embrace my captaincy and lead our team.Eight-thousand miles away, on April 1st, 2016, my grandpa passed away. My mom immediately flew to Cambodia, so now she couldn\\'t drive me to school or cook for me. In an instant, she left my life, and she remained gone for six weeks. I was dependent on my mom\\'s facilitation of my activities, and her absence complicated many parts of my life, from hockey to school to studying at home. My dad had to work and couldn\\'t take me to school, so he shipped me to my aunt\\'s house for the weekdays. I brought with me two backpacks, clothes, my laptop, test-prep books, and snacks. I had to shuffle my sleeping, eating, and showering schedule completely to adapt to this new environment. Living with my aunt and cousin for over a month proved to be a rewarding bonding experience, and they really helped me handle the absence of my mom. On weekends, my dad let me stay at home alone. This was my opportunity to practice being independent. I learned how to live solo and to efficiently budget my time. I even secretly cooked by myself and learned how to boil water without burning down the house. The most challenging part of my situation wasn\\'t that I was alone, but that I was studying outside of the comfort of my home. The timing was unfortunate for me because it was AP season. Because of how my school functions, I had to self-study for all of my tests, including the SAT subject tests. To add to my workload, I was also preparing my huge end-of-the-year research paper. I chewed away on these tasks by stealthily staying up past the imposed bedtime to study; trying to conceal the clicks, clacks, and page turns as to not rudely awaken my hosts. Despite my efforts, I still fell behind the recommended pace, but I never panicked because I knew that I would catch up. After AP testing finished, I got back on track with my schoolwork. In hindsight, living away from home was as much an empowering experience as it was a challenge.I can crack my knuckles a lot, but what truly separates me from other UC applicants is the combination of my unique backgrounds and interests. I am a first-generation Chinese-Cambodian American, a descendent of survivors of the worst genocide since the Holocaust. I am humbled by this, and it plays into my personality and values. Knowing that I have such tragedy in my ancestry makes me grateful to exist and it makes me less wary of discussing or even joking about serious, tragic, and challenging topics. My complex background does not only influence my words, but also my actions. An example is that due to how much I value life, I will never kill anything, even the least pleasant of creatures like mosquitoes and spiders. Unlike my aversion to spiders, I have a deep passion for airplanes, hockey, history, and technology. How many hockey-loving Cambodians do you know? Maybe a handful at most; we are pretty rare. In college and beyond, I want to carve myself opportunities to thoroughly explore the entirety of my passions. I want to design airplanes, play and watch hockey, learn about history, and explore the latest cutting-edge technology. My passion for airplanes started at a young age. I was always amazed by seeing machines soar in the sky, and going to middle school next to an airfield reinforced my interest. My passion for hockey was spawned by the fact that my hometown contained an NHL team; this exposed me to the sport and I got hooked. My other significant interests include history and technology because I find them both intriguing and relevant to my life. History allows me to look at my past, where I came from and how my life was shaped before my birth; and technology allows me to look at the future, where I am heading, and which I am determined to help shape. I desire to make reparations to my family\\'s tragic past by using my passions to make the world a better place, whether it is through good sportsmanship after a hockey game or by innovating more efficient flying machines.\"}, {\"index\": 470, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Personal Information\"}, {\"index\": 471, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Tell us about the most significant challenge you\\'ve faced or something important that didn\\'t go according to plan. How did you manage the situation? When I started at my current high school, I was placed into American History and Literature. I thought the low course code and the combined nature of the course meant it was a humanities filler, meant to fulfill college requirements and nothing more, since I was a STEM-focused student. On the first report, I received a B- for not explaining my analysis of a text thoroughly and for performing badly on a test. I resolved to improve. I emailed the teachers, first asking if I could have feedback on my essay drafts before turning them in, and I drastically changed my approach toward American History and Literature. I received useful feedback on my essays and learned to prepare drafts in advance so I could have time to thoroughly edit them before and after receiving critique. When I found that I was not understanding information thoroughly, I combined my notes from the lectures and my notes from reading outside of class to form an improved, organized version of notes on each historical context or event. Additionally, I distilled readings down to important quotes or concepts that explained the essence of the content. In this way, I understood the material to the extent that I could explain my responses to questions clearly and answer others\\' questions about the text. By being organized, improving my notes outside of class, and interacting with other students, I successfully understood the challenging content and not only improved my grade, but greatly improved my literary analysis and writing skills.\"}, {\"index\": 472, \"new_personal_statement\": \"My little feet ache and my mouth yearns for some trail mix. Hikes, in my opinion, should never boast more miles than I did years, but my mother always seemed to ignore that perspectice. She beckons me from the top of a nearby hill and, with a final, exhaustive burst, I scurry to the top to meet her.The summit is only a few strides awat when, abruptly, he catches my eye: the Sleeping Dragon. He\\'s such a surprise that I momentarily stumble on the rugged trail, but then again it\\'s not every day that one sees a giant, winged beast snuggling in the treeline of the Wesrern Rockies. His scaly red skin blazes in the Colorado sun, his gentle winds flutter with every snore -- and I gaze in awe. My mother\\'s voice calls to me, but curiosity and excitement have pulled me into a trance: Where did this dragon come from? What is he dreaming about? Will he ever wake up?. . .The memory of my dragon flashed through my mind as I curled up in the corner of the library, cradling a newfound volume: The Human Mind, by Rita Carter. Its candid title had invited me in, but its chapters had capticated me for the past few hours. As I slipped a finger under a page titled \\'Cognitive Emtions\\', a chiming clock reminded me that it was nearly dinner time -- however, my dragon had kindled one final question. I quickly flipped to the index and scanned the \\'I\\' section: \\'\\'ice-pick\\' lobotomy\\', 11... \\'illness and disease\\', 220-49... and - yes! - \\'imagination\\', 170. Food would have to wait.Imagination has always enthralled me. When I was a child, I spent most of my waking hours creaating the fantstical from the ordinary -- clothes hampers were pirate ships, stop lights were controlled by gnomes -- and on that exciting hike so many years ago, the Sleeping Dragon was no different. His body was, in reality, just a giant stone quarry that had been chiseled into the mountainside decades before my birth. The quarry\\'s jagged shape only slightly resembled a monster keeling over in fatigue, but for some reason my brain had transcended reality to bring him to life. And now, armed with Carter\\'s book, I was determined to know why.As I opened to page 170, my breath caught in my throat. In the center of the lustrous paper danced breathtaking DTI scans, and in the corner nestled enlightening fMRI images. Suddenly I was six years old again, standing upon that magical hill as excitement and wonder bubbled up inside me -- only this time, my questions were slightly different, and they were met with answers.What causes imagination? \\'A change in brain activity involving a shift to the temporal love and anterior cingulate cortex.\\'Why did a dragon fly into my psyche when I looked at that quarry? \\'Creative skills can emerge as fronta-lobe activity decreases\\'.But Carter\\'s research did not temper my curiosity -- rather, I was ignited. I had suddenly stumbled in to a strange, beautiful, and slightly ironic land; a land where most of the territory is uncharted, where new discoveries are made every day, where the brain explores itself. A land where secrets are embedded deep within the expansive mountains of the minds, just waiting to be unearthed. And this, I realized, was the land of nueroscience.Carter had not simply provided me with a book; no, she had cartographed an invaluable map. As I snapped the chapter shut and ran to the checkout desk, my spirit was sent ablaze. Because of her, I realized, I am ready to explore. Because of her, I am excited to discover.And maybe -- just maybe -- I\\'lll stumble across a few dragons along the way.\"}, {\"index\": 473, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 474, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 475, \"new_personal_statement\": \"When I first held my brother in 7th grade, I thought that he would just be a cute thing to have around the house. However, I soon learned that he was much more than that. Khai, who is only five now, has taught me more than anybody I know. Because of him, I\\'ve learned how to change a diaper, that sometimes you need to put other people first, and that good role models are important.When Khai was born, and I did not really understand the true impact a baby can have on a single mother. I was more focused on playing video games. After some time passed, I knew that I would have to step up because my mom would be busier with a newborn, but at twelve years old, I did not fully comprehend what that would mean.One day, as I was playing video games in the living room, my mom came in and asked me if I could watch my brother while she went to check on the laundry. He was only a few months old, and because he could hardly move, I thought my job would be easy. I just continued what I was doing, because I assumed that he was immobile. I soon learned that even though he couldn\\'t walk or crawl, he could certainly scoot. By the time my mom came back, my little brother was scooting himself down the hallway. My mom picked up my brother and left without saying a word to me. Maybe she thought that I was just a normal twelve-year-old who couldn\\'t handle taking care of a child. At that moment, I decided to do my best to dispel that notion. As I started to realize how difficult my mom had it\\\\u2014working a full time job while taking care of a toddler and a teenager\\\\u2014I realized that I had to do my best to alleviate her stress. Understandably, all toddlers are difficult to deal with. But as a fully sentient human, I could try to make my mom\\'s life easier. In high school, I\\'ve always put my academics first. I know that doing well in school not only helps me, but also everybody in my household. But in middle school, I was mostly interested in watching YouTube videos. Because my school\\'s student to teacher ratio was low, my mom would often get an email if I missed a homework assignment. I knew I was completely capable of doing all my work, and I knew that making my mom\\'s life less stressful would be good for everyone in my household. Because of that, I decided to put my school work ahead of YouTube videos. Throughout all of high school, there have been afterschool activities I\\'ve been interested in participating. My mom has always told me that if there is something that I want to do, I shouldn\\'t let picking up my brother get in the way. But I always do. It would be more expensive and taxing for my mom if I wasn\\'t there to help. To me, helping my family is more important than getting a slice of pizza with my friends after school or being a part of a club.I am also determined to show my brother that even though all of his demographic factors are working against him\\\\u2014since being the son of a poor, black immigrant single mother without a college degree doesn\\'t usually bode well\\\\u2014he can still succeed. If I want to show him he can be successful, I have to be successful myself. Because of my brother, I\\'ve learned independence and the importance of putting others before myself. It hasn\\'t always been easy to be a free babysitter, but I know that life won\\'t always be easy. Sometimes the most difficult parts of life give you the most valuable lessons, and my brother has proven that for me.\"}, {\"index\": 476, \"new_personal_statement\": \"My hands twitched towards the book, a piece of my identity on the shelf. I tucked my long hair behind my ears, a deep longing surfacing, incorrigible and hard to explain. Immigrant on a shelf. All my life, I had tried to beat into submission, my otherness, my inexplicable difference and finally, with open arms, I ran towards it. Fifth generation, Punjabi, Indian, Malaysian, immigrant, citizen, girl, woman, identities in a vortex spinning around me, threatening to absorb me whole. Growing up hating my brown skin, being teased mercilessly for having thick Indian eyebrows, feeling ashamed anytime my mother would say Sikh prayers in front of my friends, I tried to dive into a pool of cool anonymity but no matter how hard I tried my identities stuck steadfastly to my skin. Shape me, it did. I carried the burden of my entire culture on my shoulders, the sole representative for those elusive turbaned creatures, expected to constantly answer questions about why we didn\\'t eat beef, of why we grew our hair long and why did we eat so much curry? I was so resentful of being characterised, stereotyped as different when really I was the same as everyone else. And yet I wasn\\'t.The fact that my grandparents were Orthodox Sikhs, my grandfather the president of the Sikh temple, resulted in my being forced to attend endless Punjabi weddings, prayers and temple functions where in a sea of colourfully adorned Punjabi speaking relatives I stood out like a sore, Westernised thumb, made me very different from others. Most of my friends didn\\'t even talk to their cousins, but for me, every birth, death or marriage in our community was a large, personal event that I often had to excuse myself from parties or movie-going to attend. It was strange to explain the tiring community service I did as part of my religion, a beautiful notion called seva, was expected and that family was first always. I resented that I had to work so much harder than my friends and behave so politely in front of my friends\\' parents so that they wouldn\\'t think lowly of Indians and preserve the honour, the izzat of our Punjabi community.Sacrificing going to my friend\\'s house to help clean the house when relatives came over because it was what was expected of me, or helping with the cooking in the kitchen when there were prayers held. Not being able to wear shorts like my friends because it was not \\'in our culture\\', not having many boy friends because it would be inappropriate, always greeting relatives with politeness even if they ignored you and were rude; these intransigent hallmarks of my childhood which once seemed so repulsive have become fondly remembered.Where once I would have been ashamed to walk into town in my \\'punjabi suit\\', I now wear it with pride after watching my cousins who were so proud of our culture. Keeping my hair long symbolises a strength of character. Serving the community, as well as anyone regardless of race, religion or caste, has made me a more compassionate person. I have learned respect for people and all the family functions I had been forced to attend have blossomed into a close family relationship many of my friends admire. Not eating beef has brought a reverence for the animals who did so much for my ancestors in Punjab, tilling the land. Most importantly, the identity of my culture, my religion, that I so desperately tried to shed in favour of a bland replacement gleaned from years of Disney shows, gave me a strong identity to hold onto. The knowledge of a diaspora struggling and succeeding along with you, gave me a sense of solidarity and comfort. Standing in the study, surrounded by heritage, I close my eyes and reach out for the collection of family memoirs. I have come full circle.\"}, {\"index\": 477, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Six cities and seven schools haven\\'t just changed the languages I speak or the foods I eat.

My mind whirls with the influx of chemical protocols in the lab as I observe my mentor conducting a gel electrophoresis. Powdery white hands pivot from magnetic stirrers to micropipette caps, anticipating the next apparatus that my mentor, a PhD student, requires. Suddenly, disappointment reigns, turning my face cloudy grey, as I discover our electrophoresis gels ripped from matrix molds into slender shreds following overly vigorous shaking. So I turn to him for guidance and, two weeks later, find my mood lightening when I\\'ve repeated the processes frequently enough to acquire proper technique.

Hearing these words and subsequently being blasted by tear gas had become customary for every environmental protest I\\'ve joined. Yet, each would fade away after simple denouncements of environmental atrocities in Istanbul. My continuous exposure to this deadlock eventually became eye-opening as I sought the problem first within myself: \\'I, who raised an outcry in vain to advocate for the environment, have I ever broken free from the concrete bubble I\\'ve been living in; have I ever actually planted a tree?\\'My first reunion with nature, volunteering for 3 days at a permaculture farm, destroyed my comfort zone. I was thankful for I realized the striking contradiction between our unsustainable lifestyles and what we\\'ve been standing against. Rather than being proactive, this so-called activism stayed futile since even we, protesters, failed to confront our apathy towards our detachment from the nature. This shed a light on the urge to move beyond rhetorics, towards a grassroots alternative to re-engage with our roots, nature.Exasperated. That\\'s how I felt when I visited Fenerbahce Park in my neighborhood after 3 years. The once paradisiac park had withered into a waste yard, abandoned for a year by the municipality and the locals under the evasive excuse that the terrain had become barren. The scenery suddenly reminded Voltaire\\'s advice for banishing all evils: \\'Cultivate your own garden.\\' Indeed, the evil here was the deep-rooted disengagement that had caused this deserted landscape in the first place, and once again, it was time to take up arms against our detrimental effect on our environment. Hence, I rallied our permaculture club to embark on regenerating this depleted land, replacing it with a harmoniously human-designed ecosystem.To fulfill this quest, I needed a strategic and analytical approach. After numerous negotiations, the municipality granted access to the whole park. I would have to get my hands dirty to make it bloom. First I analyzed the location, then delved into planning our requirements and budget. Like a scavenger hunt, I tracked heirloom seeds in exchange networks and sought out dauntless volunteers. Together, we produced boggy, smelly compost by recollecting food scraps from garbage bins to the bemusement of our teachers. Working the heavy soil hours on end, cleansing it from piles of junk and struggling to sow perennials during chilly winds became our casual routine. We even developed a close relationship with the peppy vermicompost worms for the sake of maximized productivity and a decreased lead-time!The 1st of June, our grand opening! I was busy along with dozens of other volunteers under the exuberant scent of flowers, demystifying permaculture to amateur visitors, collecting fresh strawberries with kids who had never eaten one straight from tickling bushes. Their amazement mirrored mine throughout this whole experience; there, I realized that a tight-knit community burgeoned in the park, periodically gathering and stimulating one another.My garden resembled me as I resembled my garden. Sustainably reengineering this living system from the start and managing its preparation and operations not only altered my outlook, but also shoveled the path to my \\'germination.\\' Through my efforts to create this garden where I put down my roots, I finally cast out the feelings of dismay and the charges of apathy I had held towards myself and others as I\\'d witnessed the fruitless protests and the desolation of a once unspoiled green space. I tasted the rare fruits of self-reliance and solidarity in this sanctuary. I, who was stuck in a concrete bubble and panicked when I had a bit of soil on my hands, learned to put aside my disheartened attitude and new hopes emerged as I kneeled before Mother Nature. My garden addictively became my therapy, masterpiece and tutor. I find the comfort and the strength in it to pursue this crusade, changing myself and also others. In the end, I\\'m coming out: resilient, thriving and independent like my garden. \"}, {\"index\": 479, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Dozing off in a factory is not only dangerous, but difficult to do. In the summer of my sophomore year as a participant in the RAP (Research Apprentice Program) program at the University of Illinois, I found myself bored to sleep on a tour of John Deere\\'s massive tractor plant. Amongst the sparks and noise of metal being welded, our guide rattled on about the industry-leading horsepower and corn husking rates of John Deere\\'s legendary tractors, which quickly induced my nap. However, when he started talking about environmental responsibility, I perked up. As my peers climbed up the stairs to see where every tractor is painted, I listened to the experienced guide talk about John Deere\\'s dedication to energy conservation. In what sounded to me like a braggadocious tone, he informed us that John Deere\\'s commitment to being green was evident in the motion-sensing lights which turned themselves off when no one was working in that area. At the time, I thought to myself, \\'That\\'s it? Why don\\'t they do more?\\' I questioned why John Deere, with all of their resources, thought using motion-activated lights was a big deal.From that point on, I was eager to learn about innovative environmental technologies. Ironically, even though the four weeks I spent at the University of Illinois were life changing, I thought engineering was still not for me. I vowed to spend my next summer doing something I knew I was interested in. I applied to the prestigious LEAD (Leadership, Education, and Development) Summer Business Institute and was accepted into the program held at Duke University in the Fuqua School of Business. The greatest impact of this experience was an exercise that helped me define a clear vision of my career goals. Early in the program, the president of an education initiative called Movement of Youth asked us to write down our short and long term goals. He was not a Duke Faculty member, or corporate representative, rather a rare person that captivated my imagination with his story. His speech was simple, yet powerful, and he challenged me to think about how I could impact the world. Of course, I had been asked to think about this question before, but in being forced to write it down, I had an epiphany. I knew I wanted to pursue business, but I also realized I could change the world by incorporating sustainability, energy efficiency, and renewable energy into businesses around the world.The structure of the LEAD program separated scholars into entrepreneurial business companies (teams) and granted each member executive status. I was selected by my team to be Chief Executive Officer, and we developed a cohesive business plan that included product and service descriptions, marketing strategy, and financial projections. The LEAD program exposed me to several socially conscious businesses and entrepreneurs, all of which helped me recognize my desire to give back to the community. I convinced my team that my vision of creating a socially conscious company would be successful. I recruited the help of a renowned expert in the field of wearable electronics that I met the previous summer at the RAP program and through conference calls and collaboration, our team was able to develop a successful business plan that would employ wearable electronics for biological monitoring, and thus revolutionize the healthcare industry. I motivated my teammates with my passion and self-drive. We wrote and presented the best business plan in the summer program and won the Investors\\' Choice Award. I now realize I\\'m not just an environmentalist or business person; I can be both the innovator and entrepreneur of pioneering technologies. I can reduce waste without sacrificing profits. I want businesses to be accountable for their environmental impact, and I will show them that turning off the lights is not going to cut it. I am fully awakened to the possibilities of doing more.\"}, {\"index\": 480, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I\\'m alarmed that, as a human race, some cannot see that we\\'re all on the same boat. Growing up, my grandma would always sing \\'What\\'s Going On\\' by Marvin Gaye. The song rings in my head: \\'Mother, mother. There\\'s too many of you crying.\\' Although this song was written some forty-five years ago, the lyrics are now more relevant than ever.Growing up, my mother almost always had two jobs. As a single woman, she always had to work twice as hard to get half the result. She sacrificed herself for my comfort and benefit.I lived most of my life with the feeling that I had everything in the world. However, on the first day of high school, I realized that I was socio-economically out of place; I was one of the students who wore used uniforms and old shoes. I was frustrated with my mother for our financial situation; no matter how much she worked, she couldn\\'t get ahead.In my freshman year, my mother defaulted on her mortgage, and we were kicked out of our home. We slept a few nights in her car and then spent the next eights months sleeping on a myriad of family and friends\\' couches.Up to this point in my life, I did not understand the value of my mother\\'s sacrifices. Until I had no place to sleep, I did not appreciate the fact that my mother worked 60-plus hours just to put food on our table.But then I learned something about feeding another person. Early one Saturday morning, I woke up and took an hour-long metro ride to Loaves & Fishes, an organization that provides hot meals for Houston\\'s homeless. I\\'d signed up with Key Club to supervise a two-hour volunteer shift. We began the shift by canvassing areas surrounding the organization\\'s Magnificat House.Our group leader, Pastor Larry, led us through downtown Houston. As we walked through \\'tent cities\\' diligently constructed under various highway underpasses, Larry flashed a light, looking for someone to feed. The first person we came across was an amazing lady named Mary Wilson.She seemed sickly, but she managed to smile. We told her about the meal waiting for her back at the Magnificat House. She proceeded to tell us that she hadn\\'t eaten in nearly 48 hours and began to cry tears of joy. Then Mary continued her story: for nine years, she had slept on the streets. In that time, she lost all connection to her children and the rest of her family. It seemed that she lost every reason live. I felt a particularly painful pang for Ms. Wilson; even in our lowest times, my mother and I had family we could rely on. I was amazed by Mary\\'s resilience.Mary smiled, and she grabbed the small group of volunteers and led us in a quick prayer. After the prayer, she reached out to my warm embrace. In that moment, I realized that Mary had truly touched my heart. We walked her to the Magnificat House, served her up a hot meal, and gave her a dry pair of shoes. Although she was down, she was not out.Slowly, I started to fully grasp the reality of poverty. Her impoverished condition is not fair. Poverty is never a choice. My mother did not choose to lose her house; we did not want to be homeless.To this day, I haven\\'t necessarily figured out how to help all Americans escape poverty, but ending poverty starts with awareness and recognizing the vulnerable humanity of a \\'poor\\' person. Ending poverty starts with walking under the bridges in every city and bringing homeless people a warm meal, a shoulder to cry on, and a list of resources. Forty-five years after Marvin Gaye first sang to our humanity, I still remember my mother crying, so I ask her why can\\'t everyone see what\\'s going on?I jumped up and down and started shouting, \\'Yes we can! Yes, we can!\\' But my mother was quick to correct me.She told me, \\'Yes we did!\\' because Barack Obama had been elected the first Black president of the United States.November 4, 2008, marked the beginning of my personal infatuation with politics. I was inspired that a Black man from humble beginnings could ascend all the way to the presidency. From that point on, I took up arms for the Democratic Party, interning for a litany of Democratic candidates in local elections.During my internships, I heard many similar campaign promises from Democratic hopefuls. But as elected officials, those who were once hopeful fell flat on their political promises. I was disappointed with the political party that had previously inspired my political activism.Until recently, I had never questioned my affinity with the Democratic Party. I realized that neither party was always \\'right,\\' and soon thereafter, I realized that the weight of political identification requires a process of self-discovery that is thorough and complete. I desired to experience the full political spectrum.I progressed along the onerous process of political identification during one memorable meal. For weeks, my friend, Chandler, was ecstatic about an upcoming spring break trip. She invited some friends from the tennis team to her family vacation home in Horseshoe Bay, TX.Once we arrived at her vacation house, we unpacked our luggage and gathered around for some steak and potatoes. I went up to Chandler\\'s father at the grill and asked for a medium-well steak. I sat down, cut into the steak, and the myoglobin rushed out onto my plate.For the next few minutes, I ate my bloody steak in silence. I knew that Chandler\\'s mother was a board member for the Harris County Republican Party. We had previously discussed issues like environmental regulations and tax policy, but I had never listened to the logic behind Mrs. Vrba\\'s opinions. Tonight\\'s discussion was going to be different.Still sulking over my rare, soupy steak, I thought intently about which areas of political discussion would be featured on the menu. Regardless of the specific topic, I was ready to have a translucent dialogue, a free-flowing exchange of ideas.In between bites of steak, Mrs. Vrba would ask about my views on various political matters. I would provide substantial responses based on my personal rationalization of the \\'standard\\' liberal position, and I was surprised whenever Mrs. Vrba would agree with my opinion. I\\'d never thought that a self-identified Republican would be both pro-choice and pro-marijuana.Mrs. Vrba\\'s disposition challenged many of the perceived notions and stereotypes that I held about the average conservative. She explained that her general political affiliation stems from her childhood experience. Growing up on a farm, Mrs. Vrba\\'s parents emphasized the absolute necessity to work hard for everything in life. Her humble background meant that, politically, she would be more concerned with maintaining a strong conservative view on fiscal issues rather than focusing her personal political capital on social issues, where she leans towards the political left.\\'Republican\\' and \\'Democrat\\' are labels that we use to categorize and simplify our opinions. My experience with the 2008 election pushed me to label myself as a \\'democrat,\\' but I\\'ve come to realize that I maintain a few conservative values. And even when there are values with which I disagree, I\\'ve come to respect and understand the logical and emotional basis of the opposing viewpoints.323 million Americans may never agree on every single issue, but we must come together. Mrs. Vrba and I had civil discourse over a rare steak, so maybe if we all sit for a meal, we may discover the intersections of our political affiliation and our living reality. Humanity reigns over political identity because our identities are cumulative reflections of our life experiences, communities, and interactions.\"}, {\"index\": 481, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Three years ago, cancer tried to infiltrate family lines. It strolled to our fortress, raised its callous fist in the air, and waged war on a vulnerable, unsuspecting household without remorse. This cruel leader came in the form of seven malignant tumors that fanned across my mother\\'s chest with arrogance and disregard. It seemed to like the fact that we were a single-parented family with a young child to accommodate; in fact, cancer enjoyed getting the chance to render us defenseless and force my mother to pay reparations. Cancer is ruthless.For the entirety of the battle, it was hard not to notice how different life was becoming. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in the fall of 2013, my freshman year of high school.  This wasn\\'t exactly a transformative year as my high school was merely two rows of lockers and a cramped corridor away from the middle school hall I was desperate to leave behind. My school screams \\'comfort zone\\'; the only source of variety in my life at that time was home.Pre-cancer weekdays consisted of leaving the house at 7 a.m. and getting back at 6:30. Sometimes I wouldn\\'t get home until 7 or 8:00 because I\\'d stay after school for theater rehearsal or running club. When my mother\\'s illness decided to rear its ugly head, I would leave the house at 7 a.m. and get picked up early from school to accompany her to chemo treatments. Over time, theater rehearsals were few and far between, while any other clubs simply became ideas of the past. After every chemo treatment, I would attempt to fluff her mountain of pillows, place a small trash bin beside her bed, and make Gavin food. Even though he was only three years old, I tried to expand my limited gourmet menu of SpaghettiOs and microwaved macaroni & cheese to welcome in boiled hot dogs and tuna sandwiches cut into eight craggy triangles. The truth is I had no clue how to be the family chef, cleaning lady, or nanny, but I did know that the last thing I wanted was for my mom to drag herself out of bed unless she absolutely had to. My comfort level may have had to embrace an unwieldy circumstance, but my mother\\'s was top priority. Now, we live each day cancer-free, though our life didn\\'t change in the way I initially assumed. I\\'d been able to throw myself into new interests and extracurricular activities and my mother cooked more often (which I\\'m sure my brother appreciated), however the absence of her illness had no significant impact on my commitment to family. I still wash dishes until my fingers prune and spend more time with my little brother than I do alone\\\\u2014which I\\'m realizing isn\\'t that healthy. With my mother\\'s help, I\\'ve upgraded from SpaghettiOs and juice boxes to broccoli and rice casserole.

I shifted on my knees to seehow many teams were watching us, and I felt the grit of dirt on the concrete floor. I could see the judging panelwalking towards us, probably wondering \\'Where is all that water coming from?\\' and \\'What the heck happened?\\' Itwas day one of the SkillsUSA National Engineering Technology and Design Contest, and we already had anickname: the Washington washing machine girls.We had begun our project eight months earlier. When we were considering what problem to solve, we decided tofocus on creating a simple emergency water storage system for families that would not require regularmaintenance to prevent stagnation. With a few months of initial research we found that attaching a water storagetank behind a washing machine in between the fill line and the machine would ensure that when a load of laundryis started, the water to fill the machine would run through the tank to circulate and displace the existing waterinside and keep it fresh. Extensive documentation and prototyping led us to First place in Washington State! I feltthe weight of my team\\'s bronze medal the previous year as I headed to nationals again. Since my previous twoteammates had graduated, I had anxiously formed my new team, and taken on leading our project for 2015.On our first day in sweltering Louisville, we scrambled to the contest hall, filled our prototype with water onestyrofoam coffee cup at a time in the bathroom, and lugged it over to our presentation space. We had designed asystem with a pump that emulated a washing machine to show how our project would actually work. Once it wasset up, I confidently plugged it in. Immediately, water began spewing from 3 different connections, and it continuedto gush out after I frantically unplugged it. The judges sympathetically said they would come back later for ourinformal presentation so we could clean up. After tightening our connections, mopping up our mess, andattempting to regain some dignity while presenting our project, we went back to our hotel, sharing in ourmortification. I had the underlying impression that we may have lost the competition already, which made it moredifficult to encourage the team that our effort had not been futile. However, I was determined to prove that weshould not be discounted, and I learned that starting at the bottom of the competition was all the motivation Ineeded to spend every spare moment at nationals practicing. Entering the competition as previous medal winners,we anticipated doing well in the contest again. The humbling humiliation we experienced made me realize wewould not place without diligently earning it, and we worked incredibly hard that week as a consequence. By theend of the contest, I considered all of our work and instead of feeling frustrated that it was probably a waste, I wasproud of how much we had done. Learning to approach challenges without pretentiousness or presumptions is themost valuable skill I gained from the contest. I also learned that as an all girl team, we had even more to prove inrepresenting a minority within STEM, and that professionalism, despite chagrin, would speak for the tenacity offemale engineers.At the awards ceremony they announced our contest name and I tensed with the slim hope that we might haveplaced third, but when they said team Illinois my heart sunk. Then second place appeared on the screen- teamWashington. Our whole state began to cheer with us as we ran down the stairs and through the halls elated andecstatic. We had done it. We confidently walked on stage in front of 16,000 people and received our medals.

Ballroom dancing serves more as a representation of myself rather than an extracurricular activity. I have transformed any arduous challenge through this creative outlet to form a beautiful piece of expression that completely, yet vulnerably, shows my true self for all to see. My dance of life is one as a first-generation American. Coming from a family that yearned to escape its dreary, desolate life in Russia, my family became one of the few to actually acquire the rare \\'American Dream.\\' My parents\\' accomplishment of achieving the vast opportunities in America is one of a quickstep \\\\u2014 light on their feet while skipping to the beat and feeling liberated and joyous with an eternal flow of energy. With a glorious leap in the air, the climax of the routine, the relief that they have succeeded in their careers pours out onto the dance floor. Juggling two jobs and studying English at a local college was worthwhile for my parents\\' lives, and this hard- working ethic lives on within my dance of life that has only just begun.Energy, a crucial ingredient in ballroom dancing, creates the character of the dance itself. The audacity and sharpness of my movements in the paso doble (the Spanish dance of the matador versus the bull) provoke a confident and strong quality necessary to the dance much the same as my persistence in exceeding my potential in each of my classes and exuberantly soaring to the top ranks of my class. Furthermore, commitment to one\\'s path on the floor and dance partner are necessary elements in dance. From a young age, I became devoted to helping others starting with my own miniature medical kit that I would constantly use to diagnose and do routinely check-ups on my parents. Among the various hospital departments that I have volunteered at, Oncology Infusion, my favorite department, immersed me into an environment where I had the ability to make a visible impact on very sick patients. The simple gesture of a warm blanket or a cup of water makes the biggest difference in each patient\\'s experience by making it a little less daunting. With a myriad of poignant experiences, my graceful waltz of care and kindness continues to remain an integral part of my current self as it also will with my future one.What is a dancer without some proper shoes? The sole of the shoe is the most important component: it must be durable, adaptable, and reliable. Throughout my journey of dance, my commitment to my family and friends never fails just as my dance partner can always rely on me on the ballroom floor. A speaker from Harvard once came to my school and described the significant difference between sympathy and empathy: sympathy is feeling compassion towards someone, while empathy consists of feeling, understanding, and putting oneself into that person\\'s shoes and then offering any comfort or advice. In everything that I have done, I have attempted to actively assist others even if it simply means lending an ear to listen to someone\\'s concerns. With this in mind, psychology helps with improving my interactions with others in various aspects of my life; for that reason, psychology will remain a part of my life as well as in my future studies. These shoes that keep me level and that give me those extra few inches of confidence allow me to overcome my timidity and to be fearless. They allow me to shine in the spotlight and share the dance of my life and my positive, kind, and generous energy with hundreds of people and soon, I will be able to extend this to healing different generations of the world.\"}, {\"index\": 486, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Long ago, I fell into a magical realm. The local library was the entrance. I checked out books that piled from my arms to my chin. I read in the car, at the dinner table, during class, and even during baths.Reading was encouraged. \\'There is never too much reading,\\' my third-grade teacher said after I explained the reason for my parents\\' worries. It took years to realize that something was out of the ordinary.Books were a source of stability when life was not. I was four when Dad left to secure a green card out-of-state. Mom and I remained in Chicago, moving from one establishment to another. On one Halloween, I watched kids trick-or-treating from our packed car as we moved into our fifth residence. I distracted myself with a worn Black Beauty from the library that always seemed to be around the corner. The library was a second home after Dad came back, when the screaming became too loud and the loneliness became too unbearable to swallow. After the divorce was finalized, I moved in with Dad. I was drifting through life like a marionette and the people around me were the puppetmasters. Strings attached me to a plot I couldn\\'t escape, and I lost the motivation to leave the worlds I had lost myself in.Perhaps it was the F my algebra teacher handed back or the fire boiling my insides when my Latin teacher asked, \\'What happened?\\' but in freshman year, I realized that there was such a thing as too much reading. I had buried my head in worlds like Narnia and Middle Earth so much that reality became white noise.The consequences of escapism built my character more than any story could. Faced with the prospect my future, I sought to be the writer instead of a reader. I created stories in math; the expansion of a Taylor series was the rising action, the cancellations a climax, and the final answer was the conclusion. When freshmen and seniors came to a disagreement in Latin Club, I helped write the resolution. I learned to be independent, confident, and flexible in my undertakings.

I occasionally fell back into daydreaming or staying up until midnight with The Count of Monte Cristo, but my turbulent childhood taught me to be resilient. Every setback can be improved upon and every failure is motivation to do better. I am persistent in my need for constant self-improvement as if my endeavors can rewrite the complacency I exhibited in my youth. Real progress takes time and reflection, a lesson I learned through many trials-and-errors.Another lesson \\\\u2014 the most important one \\\\u2014 is balance. Despite my pitfalls with reading, it taught me language and analysis. Connecting the popularity of Andrew Jackson to Trump is not dissimilar from connecting the rebirth of Edmond Dantes to the resurrection of Valentine. But what is the point of analysis without putting it to use? Life is not fair. It is a hodgepodge of coincidences and unforeseen consequences. We can dream and escape and think all we want, but nothing changes if we do not act on change. Reading was critical, but I also needed to recognize when to put down the book and hop on a train to visit Mom.The library is still a second home. I go there for projects with my friends and for club meetings. It represents both the entrance and exit of a difficult time in my life as well as a place of continual growth. It taught me how to be a writer with the power to influence and create. And in case of writer\\'s block, think back to The Tempest: \\'What\\'s past is prologue.\\' Personal history cannot be changed, but what happens next is up to the individual.\"}, {\"index\": 487, \"new_personal_statement\": \"It was game point just as soon as the game had started. I could see the glimmer of hope in my coach\\'s eyes. I was down two games in just a matter of minutes, but I could tell he was holding on to the faint possibility that I would make a miraculous comeback. Then it was match point. The beginning of my squash career would be tainted with a 0-1 start. \\'It\\'s your first time playing. Up until last week you had never held a racket!\\' My coach and teammates tried to make the loss easier to deal with. Their efforts were rendered useless due to one well-known fact. I was a perfectionist. A loose strand of hair that escaped the security of my scrunchie could send six-year-old me into a frenzy more erratic than Korsakov\\'s Flight of the Bumblebee. I strived to achieve complete and utter excellence in everything I pursued. What I saw as a blessing, because it drove me to improve myself at every turn, others saw as a curse, because it caused me to do so in an obsessive manner. This was merely an exhibition match, located at the bottom of the totem pole of matches, carrying no real weight. In the grand scheme of things, it counted for absolutely nothing. However, it was in my wiring to treat it as if it was the Olympics. I walked onto the court of my next match with a burning intensity to win. To even out my record. I set out to prove to myself and everyone watching, which amounted to only the referee and scorer who had to be there, that my last match was merely a rare hiccup that would never occur again. I stepped onto the wooden floors of the court with my head held high and a will to win as strong and fierce as Mozart\\'s Symphony No. 25 in G minor. Three games later, I sulked out with a heart as heavy and low as the piano in Beethoven\\'s Moonlight Sonata. The next week I walked in ready to rise from a slow start to my season with the same crescendo in Orff\\'s O Fortuna. My performance fell flat once again and I was left with nothing but the sharp sting of defeat. One match became two and two became four, until soon enough it was all my matches. The hope in my coach\\'s eyes had long since faded out and everyone began to accept the outcome before I even picked up my racket. No matter how much practice I put to edge towards perfection, or at the very least, a basic level of competency, I could only play the same Symphony of Sorrowful Squash on repeat, tragic enough to make Gorecki weep. I no longer began to slowly decrescendo to defeat, I began and ended at the same low level of loss. To me, playing now became the equivalent of being the lone audience member in a concert hall as Rachmaninoff\\'s Cello Sonata in G minor was played on an endless loop, the never-ending sound of failure echoing throughout the empty venue. The very end of that piece, the accelerando of the cello and piano leading to three final strikes of the piano came at the very end of my season. I had won a match. Ignoring all other facts - that we were a junior varsity team playing against a thirds team, my opponent was half my size and significantly younger, I had won a match. These final three notes, my last three games, were not the most important part to me. They were only a small movement of a much larger piece. Although a sad, long piece, it was a beautiful one. The one that taught me how to accept defeat. Every flat note, every false swing was essential to the sound of that sonata and my season.\"}, {\"index\": 488, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Personal Statement 1Describe the world you come from \\\\u2014 for example, your family,community or school \\\\u2014 and tell us how your world has shaped yourdreams and aspirations.A bright orange glow reflecting on the water, I love watching the sunrise at the beach. I grew up less than ten minutes away from the Atlantic and my early childhood memories include frequent trips to the beach. Although the beach is a stunning sight, the beach is not always pristine. My family and I regularly remove trash from the beach, including commercial fishing and industrial debris, particularly after storms\\\\u00adsometimes in quantities almost too heavy to carry. We consider ourselves to be stewards of the beach, and we have been actively involved with beach conservation efforts.When I was younger, my dad and I initiated and headed a campaign to stop a \\'beach renourishment\\' project at Red Reef Park. Under the project, condominium owners\\' beachfront foundations would be protected from erosion; unfortunately, this protection would be at the cost of strip\\\\u00admining sand from the bottom of the ocean and pumping it onto Red Reef, killing its coral and the surrounding ecosystem. Through our enthusiastic efforts in educating Red Reef Park beachgoers, and our persuasion of the Boca Raton City Council over the course of multiple meetings, we were able to save Red Reef. Over the years, I have supported and participated in many activities at Red Reef Park, including seasonal beach clean\\\\u00adups, turtle nest protection efforts, and releases of loggerhead sea turtles. With my family, I have visited beaches around the world. In Australia, my family and I dove the Great Barrier Reef. In South Africa, I visited a beach with penguins. In Alaska, we saw undisturbed beaches, but while in Russia, I saw Baltic Sea beaches covered with military waste. My travels have left an indelible impression on me on the need for conservation.In total contrast to these beaches, I visit my mother\\'s extended family and my many cousins near Strawberry Point, Iowa, every year. Two flights and a long car ride away, the town is an hour away from the \\'local\\' Target and livestock outnumbers the population. My uncles, aunts, and cousins milk cows twice a day and grow several thousand acres of crops. My uncles are good stewards of their agricultural environment. They have taught me that they protect their rich, black farmland by utilizing crop rotation and no\\\\u00adtill practices for soil conservation. These techniques allow the soil to be productive now and for generations to come.I hope my children get to see beautiful sunrises at clean beaches and visit my cousins when they inherit fertile family farms. My passion is to develop my engineering skills at college to enable me to create a cleaner, more environmentally conscious world. I believe that with the right education, I can advance current conservation technologies.Personal Statement 2Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contributionor experience that is important to you.

He had jet-black hair, and he loved calling out for me.He had persuaded me once, when I was six, to climb a metal bar. I acquiesced, hoisting myself onto the pole,despite knowing that the act itself was asinine, and that it would land me into trouble. And so it did. The quaintrecollection I have of the aftermath of that escapade is one of my lying on the sofa with an ice-pack pressed firmlyonto my forehead to stop the swelling. Misadventure scarred me that day.My relationship with Misadventure is not a transient one, nor is it a guileless one. He has led me down paths Icould have never fathom, however, one path in particular, altering my very nature, transforming me into a person Inever thought I would be.I used to be an extremely timid student. I came from a system where I was taught to obey rules, to stay silent inclass, and to stick to anything and everything that was laid out in the \\'concreteness\\' of the omniscient textbook.Having migrated to Shanghai in 2012, I was enrolled in an international school, which, needless to say, was adisruptive and rapid change in environment. All of my first-year teachers seemed to have one mutual commentabout me- \\' Rachel should speak up in class \\'. I had always wanted my voice to be heard, but whenever that timidvoice whispered this, Misadventure would laugh from a corner.This changed quickly. On the second day of my second year, the bolded words, \\' Student Council President:candidates to register by Friday\\' were plastered on the school\\'s notification system. Alas, there was myopportunity. I luridly recall how inspired I felt by the ex-presidents of the council. When they spoke on the podium itfelt like they had a noble purpose, and I admired how confident they were. I wanted to inspire students, similar tohow they inspired me. Misadventure managed to convince me otherwise, his booming and naggy voice overridingevery positive thought I could conjure. I watched as the week flew by, until it was too late. Misadventure laughed-his mission, complete.However, that Friday evening, (after hours, mind you) I sent out an email to every Student Council teacher,begging them to accept my candidacy. While I felt like I had nothing to lose, Misadventure assured otherwise.I did not receive any responses until the Monday of the following week. By then, it was speech day, the only timeany candidate could campaign. I was caught off-guard when I was told my candidacy was accepted. Informed thatI had to come up with a speech in less than an hour, I panicked... but the \\'timid\\' voice in my mind begged to differ.When the time came, I hoisted myself up the stage, and spoke my mind while Misadventure loomed in the cornerwith his usual threats. I remember making a joke about my small build in the speech (something that Misadventureloved to use against me), and at the end of the speech, I told the audience that \\' small can make a difference\\',and that I wanted to be the small person that would invoke change.Though most of it remains a blur, I was told that I never stammered. Perhaps it was because I finally let my \\'timid\\'voice speak out. I have not allowed her to hide in the shadows since. I was determined to not let my fear ofMisadventure prevent me from chasing what I desired, and I will not let him stop my voice from being heard, nowand evermore in the future.I have come to love this voice of mine as it is such an integral part of who I am, and I know it will take mesomewhere I want to go.\"}, {\"index\": 490, \"new_personal_statement\": \"It\\'s just a fake gun. It can\\'t be too loud , I think, as I stand by my teammates on the bright chalk starting line. I warily watch the red-coated race official as he raises his hand, and my body leans forward unconsciously. The distinct smell of freshly trampled grass, which would become so familiar to me over the next four years, fills my nostrils. I wonder if people really do fall during one of \\\\u2014 POP! All conscious thought leaves me as the gun goes off, and I become incorporated into the surging mass of runners whose entire existences have been boiled down to two commands: forward, and faster.That first cross country race was around 22 minutes long, and every moment was pain. Every stride I took, my legs burned with lactic acid. Every inhalation tasted of blood, and every exhalation felt as if it were being torn from my lungs. The race ended in a final 100 meter surge, and I stumbled across the finish line completely exhausted but completely content. I knew that this was for me; I was aware that for a brief moment, I had been part of something greater, something that transcended me as an individual and was universal to everyone who had ever raced. I had been part of that pure and endless struggle with my own weakness and had shared that struggle not just with the ten teammates who had raced with me, or the 2000 runners who had raced that day, but with everyone who has ever run with the intent of going as fast as they could.This struggle defined the next four years of my life. It taught me to embrace difficulties as tests of my strength and accept failures as lessons from my weakness. It taught me complete humility, which is a lesson I quickly learned after finishing that first race with the knowledge that over 100 people finished in front of me. But it is also a lesson I never forget, even several years of hard training later, when I finished such a race in third and automatically turned around to shake the hand of the athlete behind me. During that first season, I began to see school in a different light as well. My classes, which I had never felt more than neutral about, became something more. Science classes transformed into the study of mankind\\'s struggle to understand the natural world; history classes became the study of society\\'s long journey towards understanding one another and achieving freedom and safety for all. I told myself that the pursuit of personal excellence that our coach drills into us every day, needed to be applied to all aspects of my life. I had to be the best person I could be, not just the best athlete.Because of cross country, I became a part of something more. I was inspired to put all my effort into every endeavor because by participating in the sport and pushing myself in races I had become a representative of the constant struggle between strength and weakness, dedication and indifference, self-doubt and confidence; the mental and physical battle that touches every aspect of the life of anyone who has ever tried their utmost to conquer their inner weakness.\"}, {\"index\": 491, \"new_personal_statement\": \"With Chris, the unusual becomes the usual. He notices the slightly different shade of the freshly painted walls. He attempts backflips in the middle of karate class. He follows me around whenever he has the chance, always with a new request: a fist bump, a Hollywood-style choreographed fight, or a frontflip demonstration. I look forward to his quirkiness and spontaneity when I teach martial arts on Mondays and Wednesdays.The moment Chris cartwheels through the door, the studio becomes a forum for mischief and shenanigans. Someone swinging from a punching bag, someone trying to sneak into the employees\\' room to nab some candy, someone hiding all of the boxing gloves. He often interrupts class to reenact his favorite movie, Kung Fu Panda. \\'Kung Fu fighting!\\' he screams, each word synchronized with the swings of the razor-sharp weapon above his head, as he draws out the last syllable in a musical tone. Christopher\\'s playful antics seem so routine that I notice when they are missing.One day, after missing class for a week, Chris trudged into the studio. He spent his free time before class in a slump on the mats, disinterested in practicing his backflips. He didn\\'t reach to feel the stubble of my new haircut. He didn\\'t run around high-fiving all of the other students. He didn\\'t climb on top of the punching bags. Class wasn\\'t the same without the echo of his laugh bouncing off the padded walls. I struggled to teach class while Chris, usually the most eager student in the room, seemed so sullen.I coaxed him with the jokes that always made him laugh. \\'Chris, look! My thumb got cut off!\\' I said, showing him my hand with the thumb tucked in. He forced a smile. I persevered with joke after joke, playful comment after playful comment, to no avail. I imagined myself trying to wrestle a door open, with Chris on the other side, refusing to budge. Close to giving up, I pretended to punch myself while singing \\'Kung Fu fighting.\\' This did the trick. Christopher doubled over laughing, and water rushed through the dam that he had built around himself.After class, Chris practically tackled his mom, back to his usual, energetic self. Her jaw dropped. I ran over to her to ask about Christopher\\'s uncharacteristic behavior.\\'I noticed Chris was feeling down today, which is strange for him! Is everything alright?\\'\\'Chris has been having a hard time lately. About a week ago, his father passed away after a long fight with cancer,\\' she explained. \\'This is the happiest I\\'ve seen him since. He looks completely different! He reminds me of himself, but two weeks ago. I can\\'t thank you enough!\\'That day, I left the studio with a reinvigorated sense of purpose. I had never realized the impact I could have as an instructor on a child\\'s day. In martial arts class, I fulfill my most important role as a leader, to foster a true enthusiasm for martial arts, by the small acts of kindness I share with my students. Thanks to Christopher, I chase opportunities for leadership so that I can spread joy through small but significant actions. As a role model, I hope that those who look up to me learn to do the same. My position as a mentor affords me the opportunity to cultivate students who are not only dedicated and disciplined, but also kind and thoughtful young adults.A single joke could never make up for Christopher\\'s loss. But nearly a year and a half later, the enthusiastic, rambunctious Chris is returning to us. When grief overwhelms him, I know that I can help him through it, one smile at a time.\"}, {\"index\": 492, \"new_personal_statement\": \"As I enter the restaurant, my nose is greeted by the wafting scents of Argentinian-style churrasco. The pleasant aura of smoky carne asado mingles with the warm chatter of Castellano, filling my heart with a congenial sense of belonging. Gaucho Parrilla, a popular Argentinian grill located in the Strip District of Pittsburgh, has been a house of worship for my family ever since its opening two years ago. Back then, the restaurant itself was no larger than my Spanish classroom, a sanctuary similarly adorned with the emblems of South American grandiosity. A few times a year, my family makes the pilgrimage to Gaucho Parrilla to indulge in the restaurant\\'s divine offerings and watch as the cooks banter back and forth in Spanish, their just-audible jerga often crossing my mind as familiar.Ever since I was a youngster decked out in denim button-up overalls, Spanish has fascinated me. When I learned in my kindergarten Spanish class that whole other worlds existed completely independent of the English language, it blew my mind. Did those otherworldly kids plop themselves down on a fuzzy couch and watch Sesame Street while eating animal crackers and getting crumbs all over the place just like I did? How did their mothers remind them to look both ways before crossing cracked pavement roads on the way to the bus stop if they didn\\'t use English? I realized that these kids were just like me even though they spoke a different language, and I wanted to learn Spanish so I could build legos and solve puzzles with them once the time came.As the years progressed with my foreign language education, I kept this goal in mind: I wanted to be able to speak Spanish to bridge the language barrier between myself and the 400 million people with whom I wished to be able to communicate \\\\u2013 and have a good time while doing so. When I was seven, I learned from my grandfather that my great grandmother, Alice Sanchez, who sadly passed away before I came into existence, was of Mexican descent and spoke fluent Spanish. I felt like I had just stumbled upon an ancient mossy treasure chest previously buried in my mind, yet fundamentally ingrained in my blood. Nobody in my family had a semblance of speaking ability with regard to Spanish despite our Latin lazos de sangre, and I aimed to break this trend. As my Spanish fluency grew alongside my passion to speak the language, I began to practice more and more outside of the classroom in order to further my proficiency to the level that I desired.From consistently speaking Spanish around the house with my family (often to their frustrated dismay), to hogging my parents\\' Puerto Rican and Venezuelan friends at dinner parties, to even taking trips to Gaucho Parrilla to converse with the staff over fantastic food, I have striven to immerse myself in the language in a metaphoric baptism of sorts. The payoff I have received as a result of my linguistic \\'faith\\' has been intangibly wondrous. I have committed myself to becoming as fluent in Spanish as possible, not for grades in a classroom or for monetary incentive, but merely because I have found it to be an enjoyable and fruitful challenge.I have regularly pondered the tremendous foresight of the resolve that I contrived during my kindergarten days. A part of my five-year-old self, still clad in the inspiring costume of button-up denim overalls and crumbs, continues to linger on in my soul, reminding me of my original intentions to learn what I dub the language of curiosity. If I happen to become a physician further down the road and a ni\\\\u00f1ito comes into my office complaining of something painful, I might just ask him \\\\u2013 \\'\\\\u00bfTe gustar\\\\u00eda construir legos o resolver rompecabezas?\\'**\\'Would you like to build legos or solve puzzles?\\'\"}, {\"index\": 493, \"new_personal_statement\": \"One simple, unimportant word that plays a very small role in the entirety of the English vocabulary. And yet for me a small, blonde, seven year old who didn\\'t speak a lick of English, that word was the anticipation of a new life, the bridge between fear of the future and knowledge of the present. I often pull out the musty memory, replaying it in hopes that it won\\'t deteriorate and go forgotten throughout the years. It was a sunny day, and the long, low building reminded me of a shoebox. As soon as we walked in, my parents flanking my sides, I shriveled up, gingerly looking at the shiny gym floor on my left as though it contained something more harmful than a basketball. The office we were ushered to was small, and the room I was led into was even smaller. The only thing that actually fit was a round conference table and two chairs, one of which I was quickly placed in. A nice-looking lady walked into the room, giving me a big toothy smile before pulling out a large card on spirals and sitting down across the table from me. I fidgeted, not knowing how to react, and cringed when she opened her mouth spewing gibberish. I shook my head, desperately trying to tell her I had no idea what she wanted, trying to convey that I\\'d rather be shipped back to Italy. She smiled again, calming me down significantly, and simply showed me a picture. It was a pretty standard picture, nothing out of the ordinary, but it made my palms clammy and my head swim. In the picture a teacher was standing in front of a blackboard was teaching a young girl and boy. All the expected classrooms were scattered around the room. As the woman sitting in front of me took her pointer finger and placed it on the elderly teacher in the picture I stayed perfectly still, scared of fracturing any expectations she may have. The woman tapped the picture again. I shook my head again, my pigtails hitting my red cheeks as I shoved my sweaty hands under my legs, trying to qualm their tremors. The woman sighed and walked out, leaving me to examine the picture with growing anxiety. When she returned my mom accompanied her, and I finally had a Giorgia Piantanidatranslator. My mom forced a smile, informing me that all I had to do was name whatever was being pointed out and then I\\'d be allowed to leave. With that, I nodded tentatively, wistfully watching my mom walk out of the room before I returned my attention to the woman once again. She once again took her finger and placed it on the elderly teacher, and I spat out the only English I knew, \\'Butterfly!\\' The woman paused, glancing up at me to see that I wasn\\'t kidding. She moved her finger once again, resting it on the black-haired boy. Once again my shrill voice rang out, \\'Butterfly!\\'The woman had now glued her eyes to me, carefully watching for any second guesses, but my lips were sealed. She moved on, spending fifteen minutes pointing at everything in that picture but a butterfly. Needless to say, I ultimately failed that test and was immediately thrust into an ESL class that changed my life. And as time went on the nights of missing my past vanished and dreams of the future took their place. It was in this way that I created myself; through triumphs and failures, through drinking in knowledge and eating up new ideas, and by knowing one simple word.\"}, {\"index\": 494, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Eyes interlocked with the mother bear, I stopped dead in my tracks, barely five feet from her two little cubs. Her gaze lingered on mine for only a moment, but the two cubs continued to stare, their eyes twinkling with curiosity. Ignore me, I pleaded, my heart pounding loudly in my chest as I struggled to appear calm. Park rangers had always warned me about this situation. Don\\'t run. Never scream. But now my desperate urge to flee blurred their advice. After several impossibly long seconds, the mother bear turned the corner to leave and her cubs followed. Relief washed over me, but my body refused to relax. I had already forgotten about my destination as I continued quietly along, my thoughts clouded by shock. Being under the mother bear\\'s gaze was the first time I had faced the fragility of my existence. What if she had decided to charge? What if I had followed my instinct to run? Feeling blessed by blind luck, I walked away from that trail with a greater appreciation for the gift that I had been taking for granted: my life and health. Once again, nature provided the classroom in which I learn my most vital lessons. Throughout my life, whether it\\'s having my curiosity sparked by the endless night sky in the Yosemite Valley, or learning the rewards of perseverance on a craggy trail, nature has dared me to not only survive, but to achieve. I carry these lessons with me beyond the wilderness and into my daily life. The day of my bear encounter, I felt slapped by reality, reminded that I was shielded from a world in which basic survival came before needs and wants. Months later, I sat in a hospice facility as a volunteer with Hospice of the Valley and listened to a patient\\'s ragged breathing as she battled terminal heart failure, able to better appreciate the value of her fight to live. I provided necessary assistance and special companionship to those struggling with disease, and spent hours each week both dedicating my own time and finding new volunteers for the clinic. In the process, I developed the compassion and grit within me which nature had catalyzed. During another trip in a campsite some 10,000 feet above sea level, my curiosity was kindled as I gazed at the galaxy above me. I returned home hungry for answers; I eventually found them in the gears of a robot, as late nights spent admiring these creations became an obsession with discovering how they came to life. My exploration eventually led to a local robotics team, which opened a whole new world for me\\\\u2014an international community of friends, knowledge, and experiences. My interest in the unknown had led me down a path of discovery. Just last year, as my search for an internship yielded nothing but rejections, memories from a mountain trail flashed through my mind: I had trekked a route that boasted more miles than I did years, and sprained my ankle mid-trip\\\\u2014but I refused to consider quitting. So I pushed through self-doubt, and eventually earned a position as a top lab\\'s only high school researcher. As I move forward into my life\\'s next chapter, I know that the countless mosquito bites, sunburns, and boot blisters have all been worth it. They have shown me new worlds. They have given me courage to seek the unknown, and the discipline to tackle whatever challenges come with it. My most recent adventure was climbing the Harding Icefield Trail in Alaska. The snow and wind conspired to take me down, one blinding me as the other whipped my cheeks. One last push. I urged myself. You know you can. When I finally reached the summit, there was a kingdom of white below me, and an overwhelming feeling of tranquility. The road was tough, I fell, I persevered\\\\u2026and the view from the top was spectacular.\"}, {\"index\": 495, \"new_personal_statement\": \"StorytellingI would never have guessed that a simple interest in stories would have such a monumental impact on my life. Since a young age, I\\'ve loved playing a game called \\'Guess the Story,\\' in which I pick random passersby and weave crazy tales about their lives. In fact, I frequently play this game at my local Veteran\\'s Affairs Hospital, where I volunteer.An elderly man with brown, faded skin shuffles his way down the hall, clutching his walker with gnarled, knotty fingers. He is Douglas, a man born on a small farm in the outskirts of Ohio. Douglas\\'s father had invented a more fuel-efficient tractor carburetor, but the innovative man died in a combine accident. At eighteen, Douglas served time in Vietnam, a tunnel rat in the V.C.\\'s lairs, once taking out an entire squad of soldiers with just his father\\'s Bowie knife.\\'Truth is, Varun, his name isn\\'t Douglas,\\' my volunteering advisor explained. \\'It\\'s Richard.\\' Everything I had imagined was wrong. He was born not in Ohio, but in the South. He was not a tunnel rat in Vietnam but a marine in Korea. Regardless, this didn\\'t stop me from continuing my game. This interest in imaginative storytelling inspired many youthful pursuits, from writing Harry Potter fanfiction to pretending to be the neighborhood superhero. Yet nowhere has my fascination with individual stories had a greater impact than in my research experiences: as I grew older and entered the world of STEM, I realized that scientific research offers me the most powerful way to contribute to stories.For me, creating unique solutions to community problems exercises the same imaginative muscles as does visualizing stories about passersby at my local VA Hospital. In one instance, the death of 19 Arizona firefighters compelled my friend and me to learn more about this issue. I listened to Timothy Taylor, the retiring head of my local fire department, give accounts of the brave individuals he had known who died as a result of ineffective protective apparel. Mr. Taylor\\'s story of loss and the stories of those 19 Arizona firefighters moved me to pursue a better solution. After months of research and experiments, we concluded that the material we identified can keep a firefighter safe for five minutes at temperatures exceeding 1000\\\\u00baC. Current apparel degrades in twelve seconds at 260\\\\u00baC. Accolades from international competitions were humbling, but what I valued more was our contribution to the stories of these citizens in our community.Consider the following scenario: A young woman with light, clear skin walks hesitantly through the doors, her hands shaking with severe, periodic vibrations known as essential tremors. She is Kristy. A young mother from Columbus, Ohio, Kristy started noticing her essential hand tremors during high school. Brushing it off as a temporary ailment, Kristy was shocked as she saw her tremors worsen with age. Twenty years later: Kristy\\'s tremors embarrass her in public and render her unable to meet the demands of her two children. Today, however, she is walking into a research trial led by four eager high school students, including me, who have developed a novel, noninvasive device, TremorX, that successfully reduces tremor severity by an average of 65%.My research projects have allowed me to use my interest in stories, which I once channeled into speculative tales about random passersby, to tackle significant problems and to contribute directly to the lives of people like Kristy Smith and Timothy Taylor. In this way, scientific research has meant more than exploring my curiosities in the fields of materials and medical sciences. It has allowed me to fuel my intense passion for approaching everyday life with creativity and imagination. Most importantly, I have had the privilege to directly impact the stories of individuals in my community, who, in turn, have profoundly developed my own story. I no longer have to guess the story. I\\'m able to tell it.\"}, {\"index\": 496, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 497, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'You\\'re a disappointment.\\'Before I met her, I told myself this everyday.

My talent has led me to experience things few adolescents have, with people much older than me, including: sacrificing my weekends for 11 months at a time to rehearse all day with the best musicians in the world, and leaving home for 100 days to tour the country on a school bus and perform in front of over 100,000 people. These high-profile tours included daily 14-hour rehearsals, signing autographs and taking pictures with fans, and in hindsight, learning how to understand myself and form meaningful connections with people; maturing exponentially in the process. Such a consuming time commitment has taught me the true meaning of commitment: passion strong enough to stay vehement despite complications along the road.The battle over my time between \\'her\\' and school has been incessant; however, I\\'ve been able to bloom in both areas by learning how to balance my life efficiently. Unfortunately, success comes with its fair share of failures---sometimes I wouldn\\'t qualify for certain groups, due to my young age or inexperience, and on one occasion a few years ago, I wasn\\'t skilled enough. However, my experiences have shown me how to be resilient in the face of rejection; how to get back up and flourish despite any lamentable circumstance. These same experiences have conditioned me to invest my full effort into what I do, and to be relentless until I reach my goals. My inclination to drum is the sole reason for much of my success today, in all facets of life.

Announcements call for passengers as they race through the crowd, their rolling suitcases zigzagging behind them. Others make themselves comfortable on benches - their makeshift beds - in an attempt to survive a grueling ten-hour layover. My mind starts to wander.The airport is my favorite place in the world. Where some see a source of irritation, I see a complicated and breathtaking meshwork of lives, interwoven and unexpected. Waiting at the gate, scientists meet artists, mathematicians meet linguists, and engineers meet actors. These collisions between the sciences and humanities quench my insatiable mind and challenge my perceptions. At the airport, as in life, many separate entities contribute to one cohesive human experience.I picture the wall of my room, my thoughts running rampant on an accumulation of multicolored Post-it notes creeping towards the ceiling. My ideas fly off in different directions and land in unpredictable places and I become an overwhelmed air traffic controller trying to manage them. When I first began to collect my Post-its, I noted books I wanted to read and commentaries about movies I\\'d seen. But over time, they became more about how I could effect change in the world.One note read, Can combining two existing therapies improve the treatment of advanced breast cancer that has spread to the brain? Another asked, How does cancer manipulate the immune system? In the process of examining these questions at two internships, I found the true value of interconnectedness. My knowledge of the brain from one internship became crucial to understanding the immune system in the other. The once separate disciplines of neurology, immunology, and oncology became forever intertwined. I began to picture a whole human being and realized that in the end, my research would help a person - a person with feelings of fear and hope.In these moments of discovery, science and humanity became inseparable to me, one impoverished without the other. How can we fully understand the human being if not seeing both the biological and emotional sides? For instance, an anthropology class gave me insight, empathy, and a new sense of purpose to my scientific endeavors. While studying the Baining people of Papua New Guinea, I learned of their belief: when one person gives a gift, they give a piece of themselves as well as a piece of everyone who has ever given them gifts. This philosophy connects them to everyone else in the world.The Baining people changed my way of thinking; whether between people or disciplines of study, we share the human tendency of finding patterns and connections. Strangers befriend each other on the plane, my Post-its bring together two unlikely ideas, an engineer consults a psychologist to improve her prototype. We really are more interconnected than we think.Back at the airport, I sit in my black tattered seat at the gate and watch two children chase each other in circles, balloon swords waving in the air. One of the boys runs to his father. \\'Daddy, I made a new friend today!\\' he says. I reflect on how we are wired to relate and the connections that are forged from the simplest of encounters. Will the boy remember his friend? Where will their lives go? I think about the kids I grew up with: the one who made chocolate-covered bananas with me, the one who cut old photos and scrapbook paper with me for hours, the one who looked at dirt under a microscope, or tried to make perfume, or hunted for slugs. All of these people are inherently part of me and my childhood curiosity. The more I learn from them, the more I see that the airport embodies my love for interconnectedness. No matter how large my world gets, my innate passion for learning through connections persists.\"}, {\"index\": 499, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Prompt: The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?I watched hopelessly as our creation refused to move. My team and I watched uselessly as our rank plummeted\\\\u2013 40th, 55th, 59th. We were at our first VEX robotics competition, Skyrise, and our duct-taped mummy of a robot, finished in a scrambled haze the night before, was breaking down. As the software division\\'s leader, I continued to tweak our robot\\'s program. In the end, we finished third\\\\u2014that is, third from last, but this was just the beginning of our troubles.At the first meeting following the competition, my team\\'s leadership was clearly divided. Each side felt that the other had neglected their responsibilities during the competition, which led to our failure. The factions pressed against opposite sides of the room, and a palpable hostility hung in the room. As part of this conflict, I too had loyalties to one side, but I knew that bickering and finger-pointing was unproductive, so I suggested a break from our meetings until tensions settled.Several weeks passed before the team\\'s leadership agreed to meet. After a tense start, we started to settle our differences. We agreed that we needed a unified team concentrated on accomplishing our goal, creating a winning robot. We met several times a week at lunch and after school to refine our plans and determine how to implement them. After a month of discussions, we finalized our plans for the team\\'s restructuring.We reformatted the traditional club officer roles to ones that would be beneficial to our club with a build leader and a programming leader. During the meetings, I questioned how we could improve on the inefficient meeting structure from the previous year that led to numerous missed deadlines. After testing several ideas, I discovered that combining each division\\'s Gantt charts, a visual representation of a project schedule, to create an overall schedule improved group accountability over deadlines. We completed tasks, like designing the robot\\'s location-tracking algorithm, on time. As the season continued, I realized that we initially lacked enough build members but later had a shortage of programmers. I recommended that we teach members the basics of building and programming, which allowed for smoother interdisciplinary collaboration as everyone shifted between divisions. Members began posing innovative ideas as they played on their experiences to creatively problem solve. As the leader of the software division, I taught all members flowcharting and RobotC, the programming language for VEX competitions. With my division, I planned our tasks and distributed the coding tasks among the members based on their experience and abilities. As we implemented these plans, the club atmosphere became more cooperative and enjoyable.At our next competition, I proudly watched our rank soar instead of fall. My heart raced as our robot scored goal after goal. Our rank shot up \\\\u201445th, 20th, 10th! In a state of amazement, I realized our team had qualified for quarterfinals! Our success helped us win more grants, which allowed us to spend more time improving our robot and building robots for our community, such as a binary robot. We use the binary robot to encourage elementary students to explore math and engineering. As a more open-minded and cohesive team, we gained members from various backgrounds, leading to a more diverse team with more innovative ideas. These experiences made me realize how important engineering was to me. During this process, I learned that I have an affinity for, and more importantly, enjoy solving the challenges of interacting and communicating effectively with my team to reach our goals. I applied what I learned from these experiences to my life outside robotics by improving my organizational system for breaking down and planning projects. This system helped me avoid letting tasks overwhelm me when dealing with multiple deadlines. I learned strategies to interact and work with others, especially during conflicts. This experience boosted my confidence in planning and constructively handling crises to lead a team, and myself, to success.\"}, {\"index\": 500, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 501, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Most people would be overjoyed to be working as a summer research intern, and I was too, until about two weeks in. I would be studying an environmental application of one of my favorite subjects, chemistry, and was excited to apply what I had learned in school. But the harsh transition between school and the real world led me to a change of heart. The stressful environment and overwhelming workload were unlike any I had experience before. Yet, since this internship was my first real job, I not only wanted to make the most out of the experience, but prove I was ready for the professional world.During the first week, I was immediately challenged by the difficulty of the subject matter. Chemical compounds and reactions from school were easy, but computational quantum modeling was overwhelming. My teachers had never even mentioned such an advanced topic, and yet I had only two weeks before I would begin experimenting. In my project, I would combine my knowledge in chemistry with computational modeling to see if it was possible to reduce air pollution by adsorbing harmful gases to graphene oxide, a 2D carbon-based nanosheet. But before I could begin experimenting, I needed a strong foundation in the background material, a foundation I did not have.In school, students can approach their teachers or peers for help if they lack a subject foundation. They can sign up for tutoring or do corrections on a test. But there are no grades in the real world. There are no tutors ready on standby, and there is not always somebody who has the answers to everything. There is only perseverance. I learned this after seeing how busy my mentor was all the time. With all the pressures of her other work, there was rarely a time when I could approach her for help, and I had to figure it out on my own.It was difficult at first without the support system schools have. My earliest experiments were all careless and clumsy, and at times, I felt as though I were simply following the procedures my mentor had set instead of understanding the finer mechanics of what I was doing. But after late nights spent studying the papers my mentor had recommended, I developed the foundation I had initially lacked. I realized why graphene oxide was a better candidate than graphene for gas adsorption. I knew why I was using IBM OpenDX, a scientific data visualization software, to analyze charge transfer. I understood why my results showed that nitrogen dioxide had an affinity for the hydroxyl functional group while ozone did not.Today, if someone were to mention graphene oxide or nitrogen dioxide, I would be transported back to that summer. All I had learned during my internship, not only in chemistry and computational quantum modeling, but also about hard work and success, would come back. True, I would be reminded of the struggles and frustrations I endured early on, but I would also recall how they led to all I accomplished. Though the late nights and long weekends spent reading articles and experimenting would stand out, so would the Siemens Competition Semifinalist award that made it all worth it, and the sense of fulfillment and success I felt after completing my first internship would stand out the most. I would remember this internship as the event that marked my first understanding of what it would be like when I transitioned to a professional role.\"}, {\"index\": 502, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Sometimes I think about how each carved wooden piece has smoothed out over the years. The pawns\\' heads are worn flat, each bishop\\'s hat no longer points skyward, and the knights\\' manes are now shiny and sleek. I like to think about that movement, sometimes quick and effortless when you have pondered the right move, but sometimes slow with hesitation. The uncertainty of the game, and the confidence that comes with strategic tactics, each contributed to the shapes of those pieces, our pieces, now timeworn from Sunday afternoons.The tradition started when I was just four years old. One day after we had come home from church, tired but not quite exhausted, and with nothing to do, my father pulled out a glossy new chess set from a brown shopping bag. \\'Laura,\\' he said, placing the board on the dining room table and setting each piece on a square, \\'today you will learn the greatest game in the world.\\' My eyes widened as I gazed over the thin, checkered piece of wood. My cheeks flushed with excitement as he explained the moves of each character, the dances of the little wooden creatures, the wars to be fought Sunday afternoon every week. I was more decisive back then, my chubby little fingers immediately easily juggling the pieces. Without any knowledge of theory, except what my father rambled from his side of the battlefield, I played to win. Sideways moved my bishops, my pawns clicked steadily ahead, and my knights moved in quick little hooks. No questions of openings crossed my carefree young mind. To take, or not to take, was not the painstaking query it now is.\\'Checkmate!\\' I remember crying for the first time one day in late summer when I was five years old. My father sat perplexed, his face frozen in a look of sheer amazement.\\'My little Laurabug,\\' he stated after a minute\\'s contemplation, \\'you\\'ve done it. I\\'ve taught you the greatest game in the world.\\'\\'No,\\' I replied, a grin spreading over my face, \\'This is our game. This is our Sunday afternoons.\\'Even all these years later, I still remember his eyes, blue like little oceans foaming over with the glaze of pure joy. \\'Come on then, another round.\\'As Sundays passed like tick marks side-by-side, the dining room table became our arena for amusing arguments over touches, and take backs, and castling queenside. As my fingers grew longer, and my father\\'s shakier, my own moves were calculated, and my thoughts were quick. Sicilian or Baltic, Dutch or King\\'s Gambit, the options swirled around in my mind. But as our games got more serious, and our skills more fine-tuned, the laughter never ceased, and our smiles never dropped.One day, after five fast games in a row, I looked over at my father. Through the gray in his hair I could see all of the matches, each move a stitch into the quilt of our relationship, twelve years in the making.\\'Daddy-\\' I whispered, the word coming out quiet and smooth into the afternoon air, \\'you know what, chess is the greatest game in the world.\\'He knew what I meant, I could tell by the creases deepening on the sides of his face.He knew I meant that chess was Sundays, and Sundays were ours.\"}, {\"index\": 503, \"new_personal_statement\": \" If you are an amateur ice-skater as I am, then you understand the wrenching feeling as your legs give way on the ice. Shock. Fury. Helplessness. The same numbing panic washes over me when the emcee calls my name for Phillips Exeter Academy\\'s Summer Variety Show.My gladiator sandals slap the floor like beaver tails as I make a beeline to center stage. I seat myself on a wooden chair. Like a content, chirping cat, my guitar sits upright in my lap. I finally harness a flicker of courage to lift my eyes and scan the audience. It is dark. It is hushed. It is patient. Two microphones taunt me with the dreaded truth that every stifled breath I take is broadcasted.\\'This is \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Safe and Sound\\' by Taylor Swift,\\' I say in a shaky, muffled voice.

This is my fault.Adding to my uneasiness is something that hadn\\'t occurred to me before: my guitar career had launched just five months earlier, when I had stumbled upon my neighbor\\'s guitar. The brief interaction with the instrument left my incompetent fingers itching for more. I began taking the once-a-week lessons my school generously offered. However, none of my peers took the class seriously. They often skipped sessions and neglected their guitars; our lessons forestalled while the instructor attended to broken guitar necks and snapped strings. Weeks in, I realized that my peers, with their indifferent attitudes, did not share my passion for guitar. I was too ecstatic, too eager, and too impatient to stroll alongside the snail-paced course. In an attempt to acquire greater skill, I turned to self-instruction.Back onstage, the daunting reality is that most of my guitar knowledge derives from confusing internet videos, frustrating solitary practices, guesswork on music sheets, and my inventive yet \\'improper\\' interpretation of the instrument, which can involve holding the guitar in seemingly awkward positions or strumming over the fretboard rather than over the sound hole. My legs proceed to vibrate like Model-T motors. I exhale slowly, begin my finger-picking routine, and lull the audience\\\\u2026When the crowd roars, I beam so intensely that I am on the verge of tears. The subtle slip-up I endured mid-performance from my nerves can in no way undermine how elated I feel.I recall how harshly I had believed my peers would view my level of skill because of how harshly I had viewed it myself. However, I no longer consider that level a liability; instead I consider it an asset. As I walk offstage, overjoyed, I realize I cannot compare myself to others with \\'better\\' circumstances\\\\u2013those who have played instruments since they uttered their first sentences, those who have received a privileged music education, or even those who have had parents supportive of that education. What matters is embracing my individuality rather than imbedding myself into a hierarchy based on a generalized rubric for achievement that I clearly defy. Others are successful in their ways. I am successful in mine. Was my performance the showstopper? Probably not. More appropriately, was the performance my showstopper?

Physics is a subject that has existed since the dawn of humanity itself. From cavemen recognizing that they could catch their prey easier by sharpening their spears, to researchers at NASA figuring the optimum fly by path of the New Horizons satellite to Pluto, acts of hypothesis and experimentation are all integral aspects of Science, especially Physics.What fascinates me most about Physics is the notion that laws and theories which influence our immediate surroundings also do so to distant galaxies and deep space \\\\u2013 places we have never been to and may never even be able to see. The simplicity of being able to describe the mechanics of the entire Universe through compact equations and theories, I believe, is the real elegance of Physics.Rather than just relegating myself to the high school syllabi of the Sciences and Mathematics, I have been actively engaged in trying to learn new concepts, and I hope that my study of Physics at University will allow me to explore the vast expanse of this subject even further. One of my favourite Physics books is The Feynman Lectures on Physics. This book introduced me to ideas I had never been aware of, and taught me how to make connections and draw analogies between various concepts of Physics. For example, Feynman mentions that the universe is like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. By watching the game long enough, we can build up knowledge of the basic rules of the game, or, in other words, the fundamental flavours of the universe.Last summer, I spent my summer break at the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes studying the Quantum Mechanics course. This course acquainted me with the learning environment of college, and also provided me with the intellectual freedom to pursue,discover and learn what I found most intriguing mentally. As a class, we derived the Schr\\\\u00f6dinger\\'s Equation for one- and two- dimensional problems, the harmonic oscillator with raising and lowering operators and so on. This course challenged my perception of the world \\\\u2013 by making me ponder about the deep mysteries and questions that surround us all \\\\u2013 who we ultimately are and our place in the Universe. Imagining and thinking about such metaphysical questions is what fuels my passion for Physics and my desire for research and academia.Currently, I am conducting a research project to investigate the presence of MSG (a controversial flavour-enhancer additive) in foods in India using an enzyme produced by a bacterial species. I believe that such tests will allow people to become better aware of the contents of their diet, and empower them to achieve a healthier lifestyle.I am also the head of the school organisation \\'PassOn\\'. Together, we are planning to build a science school bus which allows underprivileged government students to experiment and explore science by using technology such as laptops, printers, microscope, infra red telescope and incubators. Recently, we were awarded the most innovative project award at the \\'I Am The Change\\' India Today\\'s Educational Summit in Delhi.After I finish my degree at University, my ultimate aim is to enter the field of research and to work on the central questions of Physics \\\\u2013 such as Quantum Gravity or the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics. I also wish to work with CERN and other similar organisations in the field of particle physics.I am eager to embrace all experiences that contribute to my growth as a student and as a person, and I can promise that the University will gain a student who is hardworking, sincere and always willing to push boundaries in pursuit of learning and discovery.\"}, {\"index\": 505, \"new_personal_statement\": \"We\\'ve all had those times where everything is going completely and utterly wrong.

Usually in these situations there is no hope. I however, always try to stay positive. However, not only has this just been a characteristic, but it has actually led me to important accomplishments which were probably the most defining moments ones for me, making me extremely proud.The major switch to an emphasis of optimistic character and leadership role began during my third year of being a member on the company at my local studio when a few co-members began to have a fairly drama-filled conflict. This conflict began when one member had accused the other of damaging an item, when in fact the accused had done nothing yet chose not to speak up. Because of this, the company began to split into clique-like groups led to further drama that the director needed to address. I immediately wanted to help-especially since I did not want to the drama to keep growing, so I came up with a solution. After a few nights of thinking, I spoke with my director about my idea to help create a drama-free environment within the company, and hopefully even create strong bonds among the members. My idea was to have a night where all the girls could get together for a party or something similar where we could play team-bonding games. In the end, we were able to do this and all the members came out of that season being very close friends. This solution helped benefit everyone on the company, including the director and myself.

Inadequate from birth, I fail in many aspects. I fail at being tall. I am exceptionally horrible at being cool and Mario Kart is not my forte. More recently - and more detrimental to my ego - I have failed at being chosen as a representative for student council and getting selected to represent my school at Girls State (I was nominated as the alternate). I learn. A lot.To understand the full depth of my failures we must travel back to my very first failure: birth. My parents named me Alexandra, such an elegant and beautiful name if you ask me. I am not Alexandra. I am Alex. Danny wanted a boy, he so hoped for a boy. All my mom could give him were two girls. He solved computer problems for a living, surely he could find a solution to this. Thus, Alexandra was written on the birth certificate, but I grew up as Alex.He took me to my soccer games and taught me how to fight, but at the end of the day I still loved Minnie Mouse and muddling through my mother\\'s makeup.Nine years. Not even actually, it was nearly nine years but we were never quite able to make it to that nine year mark. Eight years. The first crucial eight years. The point in a young girl\\'s life where she is not necessarily finding out who she is, but she sure finds out who she is expected to become. In third grade when the grading scale intensified from \\'Satisfactory\\' and \\'Excellent\\' to \\'A+\\' and \\'B-\\' so did the desire to please her parents, one in particular. It was clear. Failure was not an option. And yet, she failed him. While she did not receive a \\'B\\' until long after he left, she knew she had failed him in other aspects. The day she quit soccer for competitive cheerleading she felt it, the all too familiar feeling of failure. She was not who he had meant for her to be. She failed, and yet, she succeeded.After nine yearsshe tucked the scuffed up shin guards in the depths of her closet - they no longer fit her. Her cheerleading uniform fit much better. He never got to see her in it but it was of no consequence to her anymore.She loved herself. She could not fit the mold created for her, so she made a new one. Maybe he saw it as failing, she did not. She was free, free to be passionate about what she wanted. Never again would she force herself towear shin guards to please another.In my room, on the bookcase, if you look to the right of my favorite One Direction CD, and to the left of my SAT test prep books, you can spot the permanent residence of my soccer trophies. While I do keep the relics from that past life, I have lost the sense of weight that accompanied them. I am more than the waitlisted status I received at an elite boarding school. I am more than the average height for teenage girls my age. I am who I want to be.   I am astonishingly talentedat being short (5\\'1 places me high up on the list of shortest people in my class). My forte lies in telling Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones puns. I almost got into that one elite boarding school (they didn\\'t completely count me out, am I right?). I am spectacular at persisting. The more I fail, the more I am forced to grow.

Eventually the Associate Dean of Students, Dr.Moentmann, stuck her head in the room and said \\'since you\\'re the only economics student in theCAS freshman class, why don\\'t you come with me?\\' That\\'s when I discovered that that mymajor was not a focus at the University of Portland and that here I would never have a pool ofpeers in my major to bounce off ideas, questions, and share common interests.My own Filipino relatives often called me a \\'pilosopo\\', or philosopher. In thePhilippines, it\\'s generally seen as a negative thing. Why would people ponder or ruminate onwhy things are, when there\\'s a need to put food on the table? As an Asian nation, it\\'s alreadyalmost blasphemy to question your elders, so there\\'s no real reason to question why society is theway it is.

Iguess that\\'s what made me an outlier in after-school Catholic classes during my elementaryyears. I found myself trying to understand society, but I eventually think I found a path--economics.Economics is appealing in the sense that it made the economy, a complex system thatdictates our daily lives, understandable. I love the logic of it all, the reasoning behind why pricesare the way they are, or the reason why governments can affect their economies and why healthcare is bankrupting 700,000 people a year in the US whereas there are no cases of the sort inSwitzerland. Everything is logical, everything made sense. I was excited to find this frameworkfor understanding society and human behavior.Moreover, I partly chose my current university for the global business major as a possibledouble major but I was shocked to find that it no longer was offered and I was the only freshmaneconomics BA student. Although economics is treated as a social science and generally belongsin the College of Arts and Sciences, at the University of Portland it was originally in the businessschool, so my economics program is something of an unloved step-child.On a more personal level, in choosing the University of Portland I was attracted to asmall school; afraid to leave the accustomed intimacies of high school. But as a college student Irealize that I\\'m actually interested in a larger school, with more intellectually and culturallydiverse students. I had also been anxious about being homesick, so I followed my older brotherto the same college. I\\'ve since discovered that I don\\'t need him as a crutch, and since he\\'s asenior graduating in spring 2017, he is no longer a reason to stay here. At the time, I wanted mycurrent college based on who I was and what I wanted as a high school student. But it is nolonger in sync with who I am and what I want to be in the future.

Despite our disappointing result, my expectations of misery were met by a strange yet familiar exhilaration that began to bubble up inside me, sweeping away the pain from my strained muscles and leaving me yearning to get back onto the court. It was the same kind of feeling I would get from losing pickup games to my brother, or trying over and over again to perfect an English essay.

Today, I\\'m not only a stronger point guard, but also a more understanding friend and leader. In a similar way, a calculus problem I fail to solve or an economics scenario I struggle to diagram sparks my curiosity by revealing gaps in my knowledge and ultimately makes me a better student.

No expression, no habitual factors that might tip anything to my opponent.Ping pong is much more than a time filler with my friends; it is an opportunity for self evaluation and introspection.The people who consistently challenge me are my dad and girlfriend. I have played in several tournaments and have won them with ease. I was always puzzled, however, as to why my girlfriend and father exhaust me physically and emotionally all game long.I wondered why she seemed to know I was aiming top left when my eyes said bottom right. I wondered why he anticipated my drop shot when every inch of my body screamed spike.I suppose I needed not look any further than my own strategy. Turning the table and observing myself from my opponent\\'s perspective has given me insight like no other experience. I understand now that my family and friends had an advantage because they knew me better than anyone else and saw clearly what I was missing entirely.For every adjective I thought described my ping pong strategy and schema, I found a diametric opposite to be true of my personality. It all came to fruition when I started getting mad at ping pong paddles for letting me down. If that doesn\\'t tell you something about yourself, I don\\'t know what will.In win-mode I was cold, careful, stoic; at the kitchen table open, relaxed, content. Sometimes when I get hurt, I laugh instead of cry - I know my leg will be fine and I would rather make a joke about my clumsiness than curse the corner of the table.However, inanimate objects, too, can be the subjects of my emotions and thoughtfulness. After a long day I tell my lava lamp that he and his endless cycle of heating, absorbing, and expanding are the only constants in my life.I found that ping pong offsets this affectionate and enthusiastic nature in school, in church, and with friends and family.My disposition is generally described to me from the people closest to me as eager to learn, eager to teach, eager to help and benefit from others in any way I can. I\\'m the person who asks teachers to clarify during lectures and not relent until it makes sense in my mind.

Accepting who I finally understood myself to be allowed me to push my limits and develop as a player, student, and person.Who knew a table, net, ball, and paddle could be anything more than evanescent fun.With that, I seem to have figured out why Dad is able to beat me.

I swiftly slipped into my traditional Korean hanbok dress, gripped my fingers around the instrument that I had befriended for nearly a decade, and bolted onto the dimmed stage with my crew. With adrenaline vigorously pumping, we straightened our backs, delicately placed our fingers on the silk strings, and gracefully glided into our performance. As we plucked each string and composed each arpeggio, the entrancing tone of the foreign gayageum reverberated throughout the spacious theatre. My forehead was furiously pulsing from the pressures of the rigid elastic and my callused fingertips were searing with sharp pain, but before I knew it, applause was thundering into my ears and my head was down in a bow.It took a turbulent 16-hour plane ride, sturdy wooden panels, and a heavy-duty iron crossbar to introduce me to the gayageum, a traditional Korean harp. Artisanally hand-strung by the craftsman, the gayageum demanded as much attention to the construction as it did for the playing. Hours of arduous practice, bleeding fingertips, and immeasurable tenacity were required to transform the sharp, disturbing twangs of individual silk strings into a mellifluous arpeggio of multiple chords. While playing the gayageum for nine years, with persistent lessons and drilling practices, had developed my dexterity and enabled me to conquer crowds of hundreds, it had also differentiated me from my peers.Their instruments granted them access to the hundreds of local instructors available to guide them in their musical conquest. My instrument instigated a pursuit to scour the city for one tutor with the ability to educate me on the convoluted ways of the enchanting gayageum. They were able to proudly broadcast their exclusive orchestra memberships and collectively reminisce on the joys of music camp. I, on the other hand, could not relate. Being different in an age where conformity was the norm was hard to accept; the gayageum wasn\\'t the only distinguishing factor. My jet-black hair contrasted against the flowing blonde and brown of my classmates, and the scent of the fermented cabbage stew and soybean paste that I inhaled as an aromatic reminder of my culture translated into a pungent stench to my friends. The an-nyeong-hah-sae-yo\\'s and gam-sah-hapni-dah\\'s of my language alienated their ears, and their sparse dinner tables lacked the army of small ban-chan plates that dominated mine. Pressing questions of my origins, home-life, and language were inevitable, but I willingly welcomed them. Instead of over-analyzing simple but often offensive questions, I snatched up the opportunity to explain my Asian heritage. They interrogated me about the garlic odor that exuded from my home, and I enthusiastically expounded upon the process of hand-making Kimchi. I spoke of how I called my mom Umma and bowed to adults out of respect, and how I devoured savory seaweed soup on birthdays. The more I was able to share my ancestry to indulge the cultural curiosity of others, the more pride I acquired for my heritage; I saw value in having an open mind, and I embraced being what others perceived as \\'foreign.\\'To this day, I\\'ve never called my Umma, \\'Mom\\'; nor have I ever eaten PB&J sandwiches for lunch. I reek of garlic, I regularly wear red chili-flakes from Kimchi in the crevices of my teeth, and I religiously tune into cringe-worthy Korean romance dramas. But like the gayageum, the individual twangs and quirks that I\\'ve gained from being Korean required my time and tenacious effort in order to harmonize into an identity that I was able to embrace. The food I consume, the customs I practice, and the language I speak have ceased to be the negative elements that twang\\'ed like rough notes; instead, they\\'ve coalesced to create the melodious cultural arpeggio that echoes my cultural pride and self-acceptance for my Korean-American heritage.\"}, {\"index\": 512, \"new_personal_statement\": \"When in Rome: \\'When in Rome, do as the Romans do\\': walk like them, try to talk like them, dress like them; be them to the best of your abilities.

I\\'ve lived in the USA and India, two places th at are different in many ways, but two places that have had a significant influence on me. I used to take this saying quite literally. I would hide the influence of one country when living in the other: in America I would hide my Indian heritage, in India I would hide the American part of my childhood. I remember it was a never -ending game of hide and seek, having to act differently everywhere I went, summoning a different person each time. I would hide my paratha and yogurt behind my l unchbox at school in New Jersey, hoping that the rest of my lunch table wouldn\\'t notice my outlandish meal.

I saw people g oing and ordering Indian takeout and realized that culture and diversity aren\\'t things to be humiliated by , but things sought after, and things that should be embraced, and I didn\\'t even put my lunchbox on the table anymore. In India I grew proud of the fa ct that I came from somewhere else. The accent still set me apart, but I learnt to look at it as more positive thing than not . Whether it made presentations in class more interesting or conversations more entertaining, I wasn\\'t sure, but I knew it was a pa rt of me just like anything else.

My palms were sweaty and my knees shook as I dissolved into panic. \\'And this leads us to today\\'s question...\\' I said, struggling to remember the question.Four minutes into my first extemporaneous speech, I finally concluded with a lame \\'...that\\'s it\\' after forgetting my third point about Argentinian infrastructure. \\'Not bad for a freshman,\\' my coach, Mr. Hamiel, reassured me afterwards, although something in his voice told me that my public speaking skills still left a lot to be desired.To be honest, I\\'m not the kind of person you\\'d expect to join the Speech and Debate team. When I entered high school, I was painfully shy and self-conscious\\\\u2014an introvert who eschewed social interaction in favor of long hours spent writing short stories alone in a corner of the local Starbucks.At the beginning of my freshman year, hoping to overcome my irrational fear of talking to other people, I resolved to sign up for International Extemporaneous Speaking. I didn\\'t quite excel at it. When I began to compete in the fall, I\\'d leaf through the ballots the judges gave me afterwards and find I was continually given the ranking of \\'6\\'\\\\u2014meaning I was the sixth-best speaker in the room. There were usually six speakers to a room. As the months passed by, I became more and more disheartened by my below-average performance in Speech and Debate. I\\'ve always been something of a perfectionist, and falling short of my expectations, I thought, was simply not an option. And so I\\'d go through piles of newspapers, give speeches to my mirror, spend hours going over gestures and voice projection. Despite the January cold, I\\'d walk to practices twice a week, carrying with me a stack of foreign policy journals two inches high. And yet, no matter how much I knew about the topic, how many articles I cited, or how much I worked on my analysis, I would never get anything more than those straight sixes.In my first three years of extemp, I never garnered so much as seventh place at a tournament, or achieved that elusive ranking of \\'1.\\' But, even though I didn\\'t quite meet my expectations, I found myself growing to love Speech and Debate. I reveled in the opportunity it gave me to examine all sides of an issue and convey my own perspective to a group of people. As I became increasingly passionate about the speeches I gave, I became, in turn, more comfortable with talking to others and more self-confident. Years of reading The Economist and Foreign Affairs helped me discover my love for history and politics, while I learned to analyze global issues with a critical, problem-solving eye. As I pursue my dream of becoming a writer, professor, and activist, I hope to use these skills to call attention to some of the most intractable conflicts and injustices that face our world.More than anything, though, I think that my less-than-exceptional performance in Speech and Debate taught me how to embrace failure. Rather than perfection, I now strive for excellence. Rather than avoid failure, I now recognize that in order to truly learn, I have to take risks, and that these risks will naturally lead to defeat every now and then.

Maybe you should ask the President,\\' he replied, with a playful wink.  Being six years old, I took what he said literally, so I stood up and went to look for writing materials. In purple crayon, I carefully composed a letter to the President, asking him to throw a party for children. Satisfied with my work, I gave my dad the letter; instructing him to make sure that the President read it. He chuckled and assured me that he would try his best.  Weeks later, my mother came to pick me up from school with a big smile on her face.  \\'Something came in the mail for you!\\' She exclaimed, waving an envelope in the air.  I entered the car, and my mom immediately pushed the envelope into my hand. I opened the letter and saw it was from the President\\'s aide. It said that the President read my note and would throw a party for children at the Villa to celebrate Independence Day. I was also invited to give a speech. I had the biggest smile on my face as I showed the letter to my mom. I was on top of the world. However, I didn\\'t know what my speech would be about. My mom\\'s simple advice was to talk about something important to me.  On the day of the party, I put on my pink dress and sparkly gold shoes and waited nervously in the kitchen. My mom walked in, holding her purse in one hand and a hair tie in the other. She noticed the uneasiness on my face but didn\\'t say anything as she braided my hair, tying it when she was finished. On the ride to the President\\'s Villa, my nervousness was replaced with excitement. In a short time, I would meet the President of Nigeria. When we arrived, my parents and I were personally greeted by the President. It was an overwhelming experience. I had never been so excited, yet intimidated in my whole life. The spicy smell of Nigerian food, the white and green decorations, and the traditional music distracted me from my nervousness. However, that didn\\'t last long because soon, I was invited to give my speech. Nervously glancing at my parents as I walked to the stage, I clutched the paper in my hand a little tighter. When I arrived at the podium, I cleared my throat and began. I expressed my gratitude to the President for including children in a celebration. Looking up, I saw people raising their hands, ready to clap at the end of my speech. But I continued. I shared my concern for children from low-income households who had to walk very long distances to school every day. I urged the President to allocate school buses for these children. I ended my speech with a smile and walked back to my parents, who sat proudly amidst a shocked audience. A few months later, it was announced that the Ministry of Education would allocate buses to public schools to pick up and drop off students.  I remember exactly how I felt when I heard the news. First, I was a little shocked. Even at that age, I knew what had happened was very rare. It was pretty unlikely that a speech from a six-year-old girl would have such an impact, especially in a society that wasn\\'t always enthusiastic about the voices, opinions, or rights of children. Then, I felt euphoric, and I\\'ve been hooked on that feeling ever since.

While words do not tumble out of my mouth very easily, they do out of my mind. Thoughts that pile and pile during the day will all spill through my fingers or flow through my pencil onto the keyboard or journal at night. It is my expression of confusion: if I have doubts, I will write them down. Reading through my own thoughts can suddenly clear the jumbled mess in my head into understanding. I may doubt the relationship I have with a close friend; did they wrong me, or am I exaggerating and overanalyzing? Do I discuss this, or keep quiet about it? What is right? Writing it down in a fit of passion allows me to first relieve myself of my stress, and second remove myself from my own situation. Later, I can glance back and read it objectively. Later, I can read my own thoughts and make judgments about myself, and it becomes easier and easier to clear my mind and make rational judgments. Writing removes me from an unstable environment, and settles me into one where I am confident. Confidence is key to self-expression\\\\u2014and therefore writing is my form of expression.It is my expression of anger: they say choose your battles, but how do I know which battle to choose? I will argue with my parents, as all children do at some point, and I will find myself seething, itching to do something that will relieve me of my stress and frustration. Some people express themselves physically, and others express themselves verbally\\\\u2014but both of those methods can be harmful and hurtful to others if directed at them. Writing directs it at no one; it directs my ire at an inanimate object. I can scribble furiously and sometimes crumple up the pieces of paper to be thrown away and never looked at again. I can throw them away and then throw my anger away. But I can also keep it, and return to it later, and again read it over and make my own judgments. Many times, I have realized my own mistakes and my own irrationality. Many times, I have understood myself a little bit better and willingly apologized for my own mistakes. But many times, I understand where to stand up for myself, when to push a point, and most importantly, how to express myself without negative intent behind my words. My writing allows me to admit things, to let go of my pride\\\\u2014it matures me. Maturing and growing out of childhood allows better expression of myself\\\\u2014and again, it is another aspect of my self-expression.

The bus made a turn and all of the sudden the view out of the window became a massive body of water whose calm, blue waves glistened in the sunlight. For a moment, I was mesmerized by its beauty. But as I looked to the other side of the road, I was reminded of its cataclysmic monstrosity that swept away an entire coastal region just one year ago on March 11, 2011. What remained on the lands of Rikuzentakata, Japan were just the remnants of some concrete buildings, an enormous ship that was driven off the coastal waters, and the few survivors who mourned the loss of 16,000 lives and their forever changed city.  On that day, I was making my first entrance into the devastated area as a volunteer. My duty did not require physical labor such as cleaning up rubble from the disaster. Instead, I was there as an English teacher for the survivors. My position of help puzzled me endlessly. Why was I there to teach English? But an unending line of people showed up at the small, temporary learning facility. For each one-hour lesson, I used my expertise to share as much information as I could, and I was amazed by their inquisitiveness. However, the last lesson was different.Before the two young girls came in, the coordinator explained to me that they had lost both of their parents in the tsunami. As they came in and sat before me, I was at a loss for words. Throughout the entire lesson, I struggled to understand their grief. But four years later, the deep sentiment of grief seeped into my own life. On April 15, 2016, my father unexpectedly passed away. The love and happiness in my life were suddenly swept away like the lands of Rikuzentakata, and I was left in a state of seemingly never-ending grief. Under the weight of my devastating loss and extensive academics, I began to lose direction in life. When I revisited Rikuzentakata that following summer, I prepared myself to openly discuss the grief that now existed in all of our lives. However, that year, my perspective of the people that I had acquainted with over the previous years had changed completely. Their grief still left a hole in their heart, yet they were starting to overcome it with their new missions in life.  The new, powerful sight of the survivors allowed me to finally understand the prominence of learning English in their lives. Sato-san, who spent these last few years crafting his own emotions into English sentences, had published a book that is being read by many people around the world. Mama, as everyone in town called her, began to pick up English phrases to communicate with the foreign volunteers whom she voluntarily opened up her house and cooked meals for. Twin sisters, being talented artists, paired their drawings with poems written in English to deliver happiness to others. Each year since then, I witnessed them grow towards their new goals as they turned their pain into power. Seeing them move forward from the tragedy, I was inspired to regain my own momentum. Although the memory of my father is still painfully engraved in my heart, instead of letting that pain slow me down, the people of Rikuzentakata taught me to accelerate in a new direction of life.  Years later, I breathe in the fresh ocean scent and take in the soothing sound of waves lapping against the shore of Rikuzentakata, and I gaze upon the city before me. But instead of the dirt, tears, and gravel that once plagued the area, the beautiful sounds of laughter, activity, and life fill the open air of the bustling environment.And with every moment I watch the strength of humanity rebuild the foundation of the city, I become stronger with every moment and let it build myself too. \"}, {\"index\": 518, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Sick Tiger  \\'I will do everything in my power to fail you.

My commotion drew the attention of a lanky senior with moon-shaped glasses.\\'Akhmedov, I presume?\\' he said.\\'Well, yeah. How did you guess?\\' I asked stunned.\\'You\\'re going to fail. You should have listened to him and transferred out.\\'That senior\\'s words lingered like a bad taste. He couldn\\'t be right, though. I fought to attend a top school like Stuyvesant, and I wasn\\'t going to waste it by sulking. But as much as I wished and dreamed, I found it difficult to translate it into results. The class average for that exam was a 56. Although I got a 64; it was the first time I failed an exam.A few months later on a mid-December Sunday night, once again I was frantically studying for a physics test, this time for electromagnetism. Drumming my fingers against my desk, I glanced at the bottom right corner of my laptop screen. 10:30 PM.He usually sends out the answer key to the review packets by now...After jabbing the refresh key six times in a row, I snorted loudly and dug my nails into my palm.\\'You know what, I give up. There\\'s no way I can pass.\\' I cried out.\\'Say that again.\\'My entire body tensed up and I could feel electricity racing down my spine. My mother was standing right behind me.\\'Say that again,\\' my mom said in an ominously calm tone.Silence.\\'You know what, he is right. Go fail your test tomorrow. And to think you were born in the Year of the Tiger. You\\'re      such a sick tiger, weak and unable to fight.\\'I was completely stunned. My instinctive reaction was to protest, but I couldn\\'t because I knew she was right.Every other time I did poorly on an exam, I wasn\\'t reprimanded because I had never donned a bad attitude, but my lack of will changed everything.My experience that night taught me that attitude is just as meaningful as results. More importantly, I also realized that in order to accomplish my goals, I had to take serious action instead of merely dreaming. Had my mother not caught me, my lack of will that night would have primed me for a toxic streak of self-inflicted failure both academically and in life.With this new attitude, I managed to salvage an 88 in the class. It was not ideal and was my lowest grade for the term, but was integral to guiding me to the right path.Now when I face daunting roadblocks, I make sure to not be overwhelmed by the present challenges. I step back and look at the bigger picture. When I took over Caliper, my school\\'s literary magazine, last year, its poor membership and finances compromised its existence. Instead of blaming the situation on the previous board\\'s management, I calmly formulated a plan to save the publication, namely through relentless advertising and aggressively accumulating funds, which tripled the net budget. The publication now has the best finances it has had in years and is no longer in danger of becoming defunct.My humiliating pitfall in Akhmedov\\'s class has allowed me to metamorphose from a common dreamer to an optimistic doer. I do not know what lies ahead of me in the future, but that won\\'t stop me from trying to build a more successful one.\"}, {\"index\": 519, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 520, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 521, \"new_personal_statement\": \" Coming to America in 2008 created hardships but provided opportunities for me to thrive. My study of piano was put on hiatus for two years due to financial problems, but a second-hand piano allowed me to teach myself until I met my piano teacher a year later.My dream of excellence gave me hope as I learned new techniques with Koko for a year. But due to my mother\\'s unexpected pregnancy, I had to give up music again. Unable to pay for lessons, I turned to charitable organizations to support my aspiration.  I competed for financial aid from Discovery Scholarship, an institution that helps families pay for music lessons, as a last hope to continue my musical career. The audition went smoothly until one judge said, \\'I don\\'t think her foundation is solid.\\'  Her comment made my arduous years of daily practice seem worthless. My heart sank as her criticism shattered my already low self-esteem. The possibility of getting a scholarship seemed slim.A week later, I was notified that I\\'d won the scholarship. I was grateful, but I wanted to prove that my two-year hiatus from piano hadn\\'t ruined my dream of musical excellence. Meanwhile, prominent pianist Yuja Wang spontaneously came to my piano studio to visit my piano teacher while I was having a lesson. I trembled in anxiety, finishing off a Chopinesque piece. Much to my surprise, she nodded at me and said, \\'Your rhythm and expression are good., but I felt an opposing interior force going against your melodies. Try competitions and build up your confidence! That way you can play more precisely with soul.\\' To convey the definition of soul, Wang played a short rendition of Rachmaninoff\\'s Sonata.   Her words and performance drove me to solidify foundation and practice to the point where my fingers ached with effort. I wanted to play Chopin\\'s music and assume his role as composer, a role that I never fully comprehend. More importantly, I strove to erase the bitterness of the criticism and play with unrelenting confidence and passion. I attended Wang\\'s concert to observe her technique. As I marked footprints and earned recognition in Ten Piano concert, Honors Recital, and Junior Bach competition, I realized criticism was inevitable, so I learned to detach from my emotions, put it in perspective, and grow as a musician. On stages, I performed for my own sake, where I could improvise, improve self-esteem, and acknowledge myself. Through music, I can tell my story of resuming piano, a devotion that gave me a sense of a purpose in life. I performed with posture and feeling; precision and soul, just like Wang suggested. My attitude towards piano has made me more dedicated, sharp-eyed, and tenacious in search of ways to accomplish my goals. I gained the self-esteem I deserve. Now as a senior scholarship winner for four consecutive years, I came as a contestant, but left as a performer. The judges remarked on my maturity as a pianist and complimented my varying articulation, as I confidently mastered the adagio movement with languid calypso rhythm.  This journey inspired me to courageously take charge of my musical life. My work ethic in the music field had influenced my perseverance in other aspects of life, conquering obstacles including language barriers, financial problems, and cultural differences. I have overcome adversity, improved my self esteem, and succeeded in accomplishing goals on my own initiative. As I continue with my life after high school, I am capable of achieving anything because my strong determination and commitment to music has equipped me to venture beyond my boundaries. \"}, {\"index\": 522, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 523, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I became a pastry chef at age eight.When I placed my strawberry mint tart into the oven, I could already imagine the final product. The sticky fruit filling would be sweet yet not too sweet, balanced by the correct amount of acidity. The buttery crust that enveloped the strawberries would be flaky and airy at the same time.What actually came out of the oven was inedible. The crust, if it could even be called that, was chewy and grainy; the fruit filling, dull and lifeless. As it turned out, substituting wheat flour for pastry flour and water for butter was not a great idea. If Gordon Ramsay were in my kitchen, I would have suffered verbal annihilation.I wasn\\'t much of a pastry chef at age eight, but I\\'d like to think that I\\'ve become a better cook since then. And with the passage of time, cooking has become the glue that cements my life together. The sauce that ties together disparate elements on a dish. I can always rely on cooking to bring a peace to my hectic day. I\\'ve heard of the people on Wall Street who incorporate meditation into their daily routine, but it\\'s not something that I need when I can just cook. There\\'s something oddly therapeutic about heating up olive oil in a saucepan and tossing in mirepoix, the fancy French word for a mix of celery, carrots, and onion.That\\'s true even when I\\'m outside of the house, though I may not have the luxury for mirepoix. At FBLA Nationals, anxiety hit me hard after I finished my event. Still, I cooked. Armed with only mushrooms and spinach from the hotel salad bar, containers of half-and-half from the local Dunkin\\' Donuts, and the last cup of ramen, I made myself a creamy noodle bowl by boiling the ingredients with hot water dripping from the room\\'s coffee maker.As if by magic, my stress dissipated.Of course, I can\\'t forget about all of the late night snacks I\\'ve made during my breaks from studying: fried rice, macaroni and cheese, loaded baked potatoes, all at 11 PM. Yes, I could\\'ve been memorizing formulas instead, but a heaping serving of carbohydrates and fat helps the calculus go down easy.Food is the key to someone\\'s heart, and it\\'s not just because a low cholesterol diet prevents cardiovascular disease. Experience has taught me that cooking is the easiest way to show that I care for someone.On some days I come home from school and see my mother sprawled out on the couch, broom still in the corner, crumpled tissues scattered on the coffee table. She\\'s sick.Those days, I skip the homework and head straight to the kitchen. From the refrigerator, I take out shiitake mushrooms and bok choy, her favorites. I chop them. I season them. I saut\\\\u00e9 them.At the table, she doesn\\'t say anything, but from the subtle changes in her expression, I can see her silent happiness. I gladly do the same for loved ones outside the family. After school on the last day, I went with several others to a friend\\'s house to hang out. We listened to Chainsmokers on blast and played ping-pong in the basement, the typical teenage boy things. Just enjoying ourselves was fun, but what spiced up (pun intended) this ordinary get-together was when we gathered around the table for my shakshuka, eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce. I could feel the bonds forming between us as we sat together over food, talking the afternoon away. It reminded me of a similar sensation I felt when I cooked a three-course dinner for my girlfriend on our one-year anniversary. Aside from mishaps like the strawberry mint tart, cooking is an invaluable part of my life, comforting me when I need support and strengthening my relationships with others.

If this sounds like you, then please share your story.My early childhood was filled with countless smiles and laughter, abundant toys and clothes, and the comfortingly familiar faces of aunts and uncles, grandparents and cousins. Until the age of five, I lived with my younger sister, mother and father in a cozy two-bedroom apartment located in Hackensack, New Jersey, conveniently about an hour away from New York City, where my father would commute daily to work. I would stay up past midnight, patiently waiting for my dad to return and give me a tight hug before I went to sleep.My father was a medical EEG technologist and wanted to advance in his career so he decided to return to school and move to New York. Fast forward five years and one sibling later: we lived in an unpleasantly cramped apartment on Long Island, New York in a Nassau County village named Mineola. The monthly rent was more than the apartment was worth. It was, at least, a couple of decades old; the ceiling and appliances were falling apart; the unwelcoming appearance of cockroaches was a common occurrence. My dad had just been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, both of which are autoimmune diseases that were triggered by stress. Upon receiving news of the diagnosis, the school dismissed my dad, eliminating his chances of earning his master\\'s degree and decimating his career in medicine.These events meant grave financial trouble for my family. We relied on food stamps for a while. My mom worked odd jobs but constantly quit to take care of my ailing father. Since we couldn\\'t afford a car, I had to resort to taking the public bus every day to school, waking up before dawn in order to catch the N22. Fellow passengers looked on in mild bewilderment as a middle school girl joined them on their commute to work. Nearly every day I endured the taunts of some of my fellow classmates. Gossip and dirty stares were cast at me as I passed through the hallways, head down, hugging my books to my chest. I was occasionally the subject of physical bullying. They made fun of everything that set me apart from them: from my frizzy, untamable brown curls, to my way of commuting to school, to my Coptic Egyptian heritage. When I was alone I let tears run down my face. Their insults constantly rang in my ears.Reporting these incidents to school administrators did little to curb the problem. I was at a loss for what to do, feeling hopeless and discouraged. My mother gave me some sound advice: \\'Using your energy to worry about these things will wear you out. Focus your energy on becoming one of the top in your class.\\' That is exactly what I did. I directed my energy to studying and earning high grades. I also became involved in many extracurricular activities. I won in art, writing, and science project competitions. My teachers\\' praise encouraged me to work even harder. My peers recognized my accomplishments; some asked for advice. Others even became jealous. Most importantly, my parents were proud of me. I was glad that I was able to be their source of joy during a time of hardship.Looking back, I gained invaluable lessons from the hardships I encountered. In situations in which I thought all hope was lost, I always came back stronger. I was able to build my confidence on a sturdy foundation thanks to the support of my parents, who are two unshakable pillars in my life.I remember my childhood fondly now and not with an unsatisfied yearning. Thanks to the difficulties I endured, I became the resilient, self-motivated person that I am now. I look forward to making more joyous memories with the people I love in the future. \"}, {\"index\": 525, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 526, \"new_personal_statement\": \"She writes without fear, without recognition. I\\'ve never seen or met her. But I knowexactly who she is. I\\'ve encountered her through her words. As an editor of the online literary journal Glass Kite Anthology, I receive dozens of creative pieces each month to read and critique. Considering how different each submission is, it\\'s not uncommon to read about pizzas in one essay and TNT in another. But never have I read a piece as inspiring as the feminist Misnomer; never have words compelled me as strongly to act as those of the young woman who identifies as That Anonymous Girl.As an editor, I\\'ve always loved pushing writers to write in new ways. But it\\'s when writers push me to think in ways I never have that I find true fulfillment. As I read Misnomer, I pondered things beyond my life: make-up, cat-callings, body shame. It felt uncomfortable, foreign, but ripe for investigation.Misnomer is That Anonymous Girl\\'s voice \\\\u2013 a compilation of all the misconceptions surrounding feminism. Truth be told, I once harbored these misconceptions. For me, feminism was always associated with misandry because it was something the culture of patriarchy implied. As I read her piece, I felt ashamed at how quick I was to judge before I truly understood what the movement stands for. But in a way, I felt relieved, aware of all I needed to change about myself. As a person of color, I\\'ve always been deeply disturbed by the idea of systemic discrimination. Whether because I\\'ve witnessed my immigrant parents being targeted for financial scams or heard far too many racial slurs masked as jokes, I refuse to stay quiet in the face of bigotry. It is precisely this refusal combined with a genuine desire to protect the women in my life that has attracted me to feminism.Feminism, for me, has become a way of living, one in which respect for others is intrinsic. Feminism has taught me how to see things differently. It has given me the tools with which I can express my anger about inequality in a more effective way. Misnomer has led me to explore feminism through books, blogs, even friends at Feminist Empowerment Movement Club, a discussion-based club that advocates for gender equality. But I find fulfillment exploring what feminism means to me through my own voice, through my piece Fe-Male. Fe-Male is my social commentary, little vignettes of current events synthesized to show that women are trapped by expectations imposed by men. Fe-Male is my way to rewrite the norm, born out of a passion for uprooting the power-based systems that promote oppression. It has become more than just my voice. It has become my medium to give others the courage to express theirs. That was my goal when I published an excerpt of Fe-Male in the newspaper at Boys State, a leadership program designed to simulate lower-level governments. When I submitted the excerpt to my camp counselor, he seemed hesitant and explained how divisive the term \\'feminism\\' has become. But, ultimately, I believe this hesitation is exactly why it needed to be published. Feminism is something to be embraced, not avoided.So when I was elected Boys State City Mayor, I wanted our city to fight for gender equality. We created equality petitions and encouraged other cities to sign them. When our Governor added gender equality to our constitution, it affirmed for me that the delegates understood the cause. The feminist voice was being heard. And being heard was empowering.That Anonymous Girl has been an inspiration, not only as a feminist but also as a writer. She represents all I anticipate: the thousands of Anonymous Girls and Boys I have yet to meet \\\\u2013 whose ideas will, without a doubt, inspire me.\"}, {\"index\": 527, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 528, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I hadn\\'t set foot in an elementary school in seven years, yet here I was walking down halls covered with papier-m\\\\u00e2ch\\\\u00e9, hearing children scream as they anticipated the final bell. Facing a classroom of wide-eyed 10-11 year olds, I craved the safety of my comfort zone, but reminded myself that I was here for the very same reason I started debate in the first place: to share my passion with others. Although I had created a minute-by-minute breakdown of our first lesson, my normal extroversion suddenly escaped me. Most of these children came from underprivileged Filipino families with no access to any sort of public speaking program. How would they ever relate to an Indian-American boy from the affluent suburbs?Maybe all I needed was to break the ice, ten seconds of courage, albeit embarrassment. \\'How many of you enjoy arguing with your parents? I do. In fact, that\\'s why I\\'m here!\\'A nervous bead of sweat slid down my face. Then, the room erupted with laughter and cheers. I couldn\\'t believe it! My introduction hadn\\'t been a complete failure. \\'Alright, let\\'s form a circle. We\\'ll go around and each say our name, our favorite ice cream flavor, and a physical expression that represents who we are.\\'I declared that my favorite flavor was mint chip, threw my hands forward as if swimming the butterfly, and whooped like an orangutan. I knew the only way to elicit wholehearted participation was to make my own physical expression as ridiculous as possible. In ten minutes, we graduated from basic peace signs and Vulcan hand symbols to a full-on game of duck-duck-goose. Finally, slightly sweaty and laughing, I sat the kids down and taught them the fundamental structure of a debate contention: claim, evidence, impact. As they took notes, I realized something. \\'The kids around me\\' had become my students.The first few classes, my students tried to test me\\\\u2014ignoring the main speaker, starting paper ball fights, even standing on their chairs to mock a teammate\\'s argument. Coolly masking my frustration, I used their competitive desire against them: from that point on, anyone who disrupted or misbehaved would automatically lose their debate. I successfully channeled their energy positively while still remaining their mentor.However, the challenge continued. My goal had been to teach public forum debate: persuasive speaking based on real-world issues. Unfortunately, the strict format and constant research seemed too boring for my young students. Watching them regurgitate random facts with no analysis, I realized I wasn\\'t thinking from their elementary school point of view. They needed spontaneity, simplicity, and the flexibility to express their actual views on topics that mattered to them. Therefore, I introduced a different style of debate, using limited preparation and logic to craft arguments about topics kids cared about. Immediately, my students were scribbling down arguments about cell phones in the classroom and pets in public spaces. Over the next few months, I got to know each student personally. Many kids who had barely been able to look me in the eye on day one were soon high-fiving me on the way out, radiating confidence. It gave me boundless pride. On the last day of class, as their parents watched them articulate their own arguments, I found myself holding 25 homemade thank you cards, many expressing a desire to continue debate in middle school. Luckily, they got their chance when the school activity director approached me and asked whether I would like to expand my outreach program into the middle school, and possibly start a league with other local schools.In the end, I learned as much as my students. I discovered a new capacity for confidence, flexibility, and caring.

While most kids questioned why the sky is blue, I questioned if I really existed. One of my earliest memories is me asking my mother if I was really a person with thinking abilities or if I was just a doll in the toy box. That sort of abstract thinking had always captivated me. However, when I first encountered basic chemistry, something that was not abstract, I was still captivated by the answers it provided. Chemistry is the basis of everything, biotic or abiotic. Though it will never answer my rhetorical question, chemistry satisfyingly states that if I do exist, the reason for it is individual atoms combining to create this weirdo that is myself.  As I matured, I was captivated by another aspect of chemistry: experiments. My second grade teacher showed us crystallization of salt solutions. Intrigued, I went home, grabbed epsom salt from the bathroom and a cup from my toy kitchen set, and secretly mixed my own salt solution. The experiment went well until I spilt the solution onto my carpet. Frantically, I tried to clean up after myself, knowing that my mom would be beyond mad when she found out about my secret experiment. Sadly, my second grade cleaning skills were nonexistent. My mom walked into my room one morning to a crystallized carpet, earning me a scolding. These sneaky experiments happened repeatedly \\\\u2014staining the tile floors green after trying to remove color from an autumn leaf, staining the carpet orange trying to mix a solution with medical iodine. Even with these home-destroying-experiments that drove my mother mad, she recognized my interest in chemistry and encouraged it.  I delved deeper into my love for chemistry in high school, where I started basic chemistry during freshman year. Since it is an advanced class, many people advised against taking it as a freshman. However, my love for chemistry strengthened and I earned an A. I persisted, taking IB Chemistry 1 & 2.  No matter how tedious the work sometimes, chemistry is still undoubtedly my favorite subject as it pushes me to evaluate, question, and test the world in which I live.\"}, {\"index\": 530, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I wrote a little bit about my experience with workshop at the Iowa Young Writers\\' Studio and how it transformed my relationship with writing and writers. I can share if contacted.\"}, {\"index\": 531, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\\'La ilaha il Allah, Muhammad rasul Allah.\\' There is no god but God and Muhammad is his prophet. A smile grew on my face as I started to laugh. I couldn\\'t contain my joy. \\'You\\'re Muslim now!\\' my friend exclaimed. I could hear her smile through the phone. \\'Alhamdulillah,\\' I breathed. Praise be to God.Growing up as a daughter of two Christian ministers, faith has been a central part of my life from the beginning. Illustrated Bible stories were a bedtime ritual, and every Sunday was \\'take your kid to work day.\\' I practiced my faith through service in the community, whether in New York City, Ecuador, rural Appalachia, or most prominently my urban hometown of New Britain.As I got older, however, my religious background wasn\\'t enough to sustain my beliefs. I began to question. I questioned the fundamentals of Christian theology, the Holy Trinity and the divinity of Jesus. I questioned its sociological impacts, the privilege it gave me in the US. With each question came uncertainty, and with uncertainty, more questions. I struggled. I was losing my religion but not my faith; I was stuck without structure. Deep down, I knew there was a God. That foundational belief of my childhood remained with me, but I no longer knew how to express it.Gradually, I started learning more about Islam. The religion seemed to be popping up in every aspect of my life, from learning about its globalizing impact in World History to a strengthening friendship with a Muslim peer and engaging in interfaith dialogue during Youth Group. As I learned more about Islam, it seemed like the perfect religion. Social justice and service are central to the religion, evident in the pillar of zakat, a charity tax. In Islam, not only is service the expression of faith, it is a religious obligation.I began to pray in the Islamic tradition as my knowledge turned to practice and I felt closer to God than I ever had before. There\\'s something meditative about falling with your face on the floor before your God an hour before dawn. Islam grounded me.It was the day after the anniversary of my baptism when I converted. It was a natural progression; I felt like I was renewing my faith, beginning a new chapter of my life with God. After 6 months, I don\\'t know what exactly pushed me to convert officially. I have to believe that it was God.Once I finally took the shahadah, the Islamic statement of faith, I found a community that welcomed me enthusiastically. The heartfelt greetings of \\'Salaam alaikum!\\' along with handshakes and cheek kisses before prayers at the mosque gave me a sense of belonging, a belonging I had never fully experienced in any church, where cordial smiles greeted me only because I was the pastor\\'s kid. At the mosque, despite my differences as a white, non-Arabic speaking, American convert, I was accepted.I thought that in Islam I would find a lifelong religion. But I\\'ve begun to question that religion in the same way that I did Christianity. I question the existence of the akhira, or the afterlife, and the finality of the Prophet Muhammad\\'s message. It\\'s scary, returning to the uncertainty and confusion of faith without religion. But I think it\\'s necessary. Only in the absence of structure can I find why spirituality without a religious foundation isn\\'t enough, how religion can provide an avenue for the expression of my values. I don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever find the \\'perfect religion\\' for me. I doubt there is one. No matter what, though, I will continue to explore, I will continue to pursue the curiosity, diversity, and service my various expressions of faith have taught me, growing with and through God for the rest of my life.\"}, {\"index\": 532, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Like nearly all high school students, I\\'ve tried to realize who I am as an individual. For me, this included coming to terms with my sexuality a year ago. Achieving this awareness has taken up a good deal of my thinking, and my internet-surfing; I\\'d use the internet to find some way to validate my feelings, some way to escape, some way to bring my mind to peace.I found it through internet personalities like Laci Green, a YouTuber known for her work in sex education, most notably her \\'Sex+\\' YouTube channel.The information she offered helped me become increasingly comfortable admitting to myself who I really am. I naturally developed a strong interest in \\'comprehensive sex education\\' topics, since her channel touches upon much more than sexuality (gender identity, body image, safe sex, and consent vs. rape, to name a few).With time, I began to open up to some of my friends about myself and share the new information I had found. They, too, became more comfortable with their own identities and more understanding of the community as a whole.Around this time, both my personal and internet discoveries were really starting to become preeminent in my life. After experiencing my own increased levels of external and personal comfort, as well as witnessing the same in my friends, I began to understand the source of many troubles for the LGBTQ community--a lack of accurate education about the community for the larger world.Large majorities most likely learn the bulk of their LGBTQ- or sex education-based misinformation through unreliable and unprofessional \\'sources,\\' such as satiric media. Many schools, regardless of age-level, refuse to thoroughly educate about the basics of sexual activity, whether hetero- or homosexual. True comprehensive curricula are relatively sparse in the United States. Because of this lack of easily accessible and accurate information, as well as a generally weak desire to independently pursue proper LGBTQ-based knowledge, most people do not have a true understanding of the realities and feelings present in this community, an understanding I\\'ve found to be an essential component of wide-spread acceptance.With that, I\\'ve been inspired to educate others about gender and sex-related topics. I want to see more people become more comfortable openly discussing these kinds of matters and more accepting of other people\\'s identities and self-expression. Although it may appear that there is no direct connection, being more open about sex and gender as a society could lead to increased comfort on the individual level; teaching about body image, gender identity, sexual orientation, safe sex, and the like, whether in schools or even at home, could help individual people discover their most authentic self, while also promoting better health, both sexually and mentally.Considering the numerous ways so many people could be helped by expanding education pertaining to sex, gender, and identity motivates me to get involved in this education; I felt such a relief as I learned more about myself, and I\\'d love to help people feel the same. Unfortunately, opportunities for me to get involved have been generally limited so far due to my past discomfort with myself and fear of judgment.I have taken a few small steps, however, on my own already, relating some English class presentations to these topics, including a tenth grade persuasive speech pertaining to gay adoption and an eleventh grade final presentation explaining the differences between comprehensive and abstinence-only sex education. But, in college and beyond, I plan to get more involved in the LGBTQ community and teaching about gender identity and sexuality. I hope that one day, similarly to the YouTubers that helped me, I can inspire that same confidence in someone else.\"}, {\"index\": 533, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The crackling bonfire forms several shadows on the snow.

I ride dragons and embark on courageous crusades to slay evil giants. All these adventureshave filled me with an unshakable confidence; they have removed my fears of raising my voice against theprejudices and injustices I see around me, especially the harassment and sexual violence of women prevalent inmy country. In Grade 10, while standing at the bus stop, I saw a burly man constantly harassing a girl. Thinking ofThor, I stood up to his towering frame and questioned him: if this were your sister in place of this girl, I asked,would you still be harassing her?Among the Norse gods, it is Odin who is my favorite because of his relentless pursuit of knowledge; he evensacrifices his eye to drink from the Well of Wisdom. I view the quest for knowledge as a central goal of my life. Ihave not sacrificed my eye, but I keenly observe the world around me, jotting down notes in my pocket notebookthroughout my day. I spend my nights researching these notes; from the Latin roots of the word \\'militate;\\' to theharmonic analysis of the Heisenberg\\'s Uncertainty Principle; to the origins of Transcendentalism, I only drink fromthe very depths of the wisdom well. Odin also gains knowledge from his ravens that report their observations ofthe world. My ravens are the NYTimes, The Guardian, and Times of India, which keep me abreast of globalevents.Apart from fueling my quest for knowledge, Norse Mythology has been my solace in difficult times. In January2015, my health severely deteriorated and in March I developed hemiplegic migraine. Consequently, I wasparalyzed on the left side of body. I worried my paralysis might be permanent. My Norse myths were my escapefrom fear. I visualized Norse heroes who had bravely conquered insurmountable odds. I reminded myself that Ishared the same power to overcome my migraine and paralysis, and ultimately, I did.During my paralysis, I reflected on the purpose of knowledge. I returned to Odin\\'s myths to rediscover that hispursuit of wisdom was always undertaken for the betterment of humanity. His ravens informed him where tointervene in humans\\' suffering. To emulate Odin, I conducted extensive social research into the origins of themisogyny and violence toward women in my country. I analyzed factors like education, religion, patriarchal culture,political scenario, and economic status. The results helped guide the NGO I founded, the Sabal Naari Foundation,which is devoted to preventing women from becoming victims of violence by empowering them through self-defense and education.Working in my NGO has shown me the prodigious power of knowledge to change the lives of thousands ofwomen. I will continue to follow Odin and pursue knowledge and the betterment of society for my entire life.

We set out around 2 p.m. and launched a three-teenager Tour-de-Suburban-Florida that took us to Ward Park, a strange mix of playground equipment, signs with aerobics tips for senior citizens, and clumps of scrubby bushes and trees.

In our Singaporean version of a Toyota minivan, we passed it almost daily. Those words seemed so thoughtless. Not only did a mud-splattered, stark white tarp by the side of a highway seem like such an insensitive way to notify families, but on a crowded island my parents often nicknamed the \\'concrete jungle,\\' that cemetery was an oasis\\\\u2014 and the government planned to build a road precisely on top of it. Just like that. Few questions asked, and definitely none answered, land was considered a precious resource and no amount of history or character could prevent the destruction. But those antiquated brick tombs overgrown with ivy and half-hidden by dense jungle were comforting. Exploring the winding trails and narrow footpaths on horseback was like escaping into my own slice of paradise, albeit complete with monitor lizards, long-tailed macaques, and wild dogs, but calming nonetheless. As odd as it sounds, a Chinese cemetery facing extinction thousands of miles away is still one of my favorite places on this Earth.I grew up fearing the occasional spider in my basement and most definitely strangers, but deeper down was a more intrinsic fear\\\\u2014 the unknown, death. Halloween specials on Disney and the intermittent Goosebumps books I read idealized the dead as zombie-like creatures or portrayed cemeteries as haunted graveyards crawling with ill-tempered spirits. I don\\'t think I had even stepped foot in one until I was ten. You can imagine my disdain when my mother announced I had been volunteered to exercise Youth Olympic Games horses every Saturday morning on hacks around Bukit Brown cemetery behind the stables.After weeks of gluing myself to the squirmy backs of snorting beasts, I realized I was in more danger of being trampled by ornery horses than mystical souls from gravesites. On multiple occasions, snapping twigs or the thrilled squeals of pedestrians transformed our group of horses into a galloping, bucking, and rearing charade, and the next five minutes would be spent clutching the saddle with all of the strength my body could muster. Despite a number of close calls, creek crossings, and obstructed paths, I never managed to be catapulted off my steed. I learned to appreciate those adrenaline-filled weekend mornings, when the humidity was so great that steam drifted to the treetops and plump tangerines or mooncakes lined the trails as offerings to the gods; when the canopies formed a barrier against the outside world and hushed whispers were the only remnants of blaring horns and heavy construction.But the clatter of metal horseshoes on worn pavement wasn\\'t the only traffic through the picturesque cemetery. The footsteps of naturalists, artists, dog-walkers, and even the elderly caretakers whose dilapidated huts lay hidden among the undergrowth were living reminders\\\\u2014 we were the silent protestors that the futuristic skyscrapers and engineering feats a few kilometers down the road would never compensate for years of vibrant cultural customs. Those lonely mornings enveloped by impenetrable jungle taught me that infrastructure and a country\\'s GDP are only superficial characteristics; we must delve deeper and find an appreciation for the subtler gifts of nature and experience. Only when I pushed aside prior notions could I acknowledge the sheer beauty disguised by a lifetime of materialism.Bukit Brown is a few years from obliteration. The government romanticizes its future as one of a thousand four-lane roads and monotonous housing compounds, and its impending doom begs a question: At what point are we willing to eradicate our past in anticipation of the future?I may never revisit the haven of my childhood. If I do return, the interstates and surrounding city will have swallowed one of the last surviving relics of Singapore\\'s vivid history and the site of my fondest memories in that island nation.

One becomes two, three, four as they multiply, their subtle cast against our near-identical faces. Wax melts over the edges, its atoms released from their restrictions just as ours have barely begun. We gasp for air, our lips twitching in formation. A final shallow inhale of anticipation. Release. From the moment I was born, I have lead a life of twos. Everything my twin and I owned had a fraternal counterpart just as we did. Every shirt she had in pink I had in purple. Every page she filled with numbers I filled with words. Just as everything from our t-shirts to our toothbrushes were identical with opposite qualities, so were we. She held a permanent pout, I a subsisting smile. She marched to the beat of her own drum, while I stood safely on the sidelines. So much as our Myers-Briggs test results would suggest incompatibility, but I find that even this meticulous questionnaire ignores an essential quality to our relationship. For, the things that could have driven us further apart have inexplicably brought us closer together. We are connected through shared glances and inside jokes, obscure quotes, and homemade birthday cards. A life made all the more enriching by a near opposite counterpart. As a black dot in a sea of white, a Northerner in the heart of the South, it seems as though I live in a world skewed against my stability, yet my life has been preparing me for it all along. I am the American daughter to African parents. I am a fraternal twin. I analyze in straight lines, but think in scribbles. My brain was constructed to make math my weakness, so I defiantly made it my strength. But not all of my interests are dichotomous. My music taste consists of everything from the poignant prosody of raw vocals, to the strum of an acoustic guitar, to questionably composed rap music. I simultaneously entertain Atheism, Daoism, and the simulation hypothesis. Having grown up in two reminds me that I do not have to choose. I am more than the superficial reflection of my twin, for my identity defines itself most clearly not in contrast to another, but within a continuum. Despite accepting variety within myself, I initially had difficulty embracing it in my environment. Living in my world of rigid divisions, in which grilles and cornrows are worn as costumes and racial slurs were once spray-painted on the walls, is isolating. At times it makes me feel as though I am standing in a cave afraid to open my mouth, for fear that my voice will not echo back. But it also compels me to explore the ideas that construct differing opinions. I have since come to discover that my voice, and my values, comes in different forms, and that there is weakness in both perspectives. Each side has holes that only an understanding of the other can fill, a trait that not only exposes the flaw in dichotomy, but offers a chance for two sides to unite. As I came to recognize the inherent interconnectedness of my environment, it began to manifest itself in my interests. I found that the best forms of creative expression arose from a deliberate composition. That without the written word, the beauty and complexity of numbers existed without comprehension. Interconnectedness is a quality I\\'ve learned to appreciate over time, but it has taken form in my life since the beginning. Like my interests and environment, my twin and I contrast clearly, yet our similarities are impossible to ignore. Our reactions are reminiscent of one another, our voices often in unison.

Some may call her a crazy Catholic, others might recognize her as a steadfast conservative, but in my eyes she was just a teacher here to educate me about my religion. It was the second day of class, and one my friends distinctively asked, \\'I saw something on the news yesterday about gay people, and I was wondering if Catholics believe in that.\\' Valid question. I thought in my mind, \\'Why should we care about what others do so much?\\' However, my teacher had a catastrophically different opinion. She replied, \\'As a Catholic you should be 100% against gay marriage and gay people. It is a sin against God and an abomination.\\' Now don\\'t get me wrong, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but before you express your opinion, you must cautiously be aware of how that might affect others around you. What she didn\\'t know was that one of her students was gay, and another student had two moms. While I was apprehensive to voice my opinion on the subject matter, my friend bravely exclaimed, \\'But I have two moms.\\' The expression on the teacher\\'s face was a mix of disgust and disappointment, kind of like my mom\\'s face when she sees my room, yet this was a much more serious dilemma. She replied to him, \\'Well I\\'m sorry, but your parents are an abomination to this faith.\\' I will never forget this statement by my teacher because that is when my perception on the world was altered. I loved my religion and my community of faith, but I am an abomination just because I am gay?. This question did not sit right with me. I knew that my words to that teacher would make no impression on her life, but what I needed to do was to open the eyes of a community. My goal was not to change people\\'s mindsets on the LGBT community, but on acceptance. Isn\\'t that what religion is all about? Forming a community of faith with others around you, loving each other, and loving yourself. Faith gives us hope in life. That is the purpose of religion: hope and acceptance of others for who they are. I knew I had to help the next generation learn how to accept others in their faith, and not to just see Catholics as the cookie cutter mold the media and television portray. This lead me to my decision to teach a 6th grade faith formation class at my church as a volunteer; that was my way of aiding not only the present, but affecting the future of my community. I never spoke once to my sixth graders about being gay. I did not believe it was important or necessary. Instead, we focused on how to be a Catholic in our community. To give back, to care for others, and most importantly, to love one another as God loves us. I know ample people have their various opinions on whether religion is beneficial or detrimental for our society, but I am glad that I have that hope to keep going every day, and to show compassion to every face that passes me by no matter who they are. I hope that is something I passed on to my class.\"}, {\"index\": 541, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 542, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 543, \"new_personal_statement\": \"A malfunctioning Parrot drone grazed the side of my face as I huddled over a broken Macbook Air, the sounds of overheated CPUs interlacing with the blaring EDM. Just as the volume in the room reached its peak, the elevator door opened to reveal yet another dozen attendees arriving with an armload of hardware and equipment.The day had hardly even begun, and yet the hackathon was already a bevy of chaos....I learned to program in middle school, after accidentally finding my father\\'s old C textbook in our attic and discovering that I was able to understand the complicated syntax and compiler commands. The early trials with creating simple games soon led to a fascination with the possibilities of programming as a practical skill.It was still four years before I would put my skills to use when I registered to attend a programming competition - or hackathon - at the University of North Carolina. I was beyond invigorated by the throngs of collegiates building artificial intelligence chat bots, augmented reality wearable apps, and cancer-fighting medical technology in one weekend, and I returned home with the hopes of finding a similar community in New York.While I certainly did encounter a professional hacking scene, I realized that almost none of my peers attended hackathons, or were even interested in collaborative programming. In a moment of reckless inspiration, as I was speaking with the head of the computer science department at my school, I suggested that we start a Stuyvesant High School hackathon, leading to the declaration of what would henceforth be dubbed StuyHacks. Forming a team wasn\\'t hard, but finding a means of actually hosting the event presented a larger issue - without the support of a university sponsor, which most hackathons depended upon, it was difficult to raise funds to purchase equipment, venue space, or even the basic amenities we\\'d be offering to our attendees. Amidst coordinating Android development workshops and finding programming mentors, my directors and I scattered across the city over the weeks leading up to the hackathon in an effort to reach out to supporters in time for the event.Even as we celebrated our small successes - raising thousands in sponsorship for prizes and food - the momentum didn\\'t last long before the responsibilities of our lives soon caught up with us. Amazon orders fell by the wayside, our venue - a small co-working space in Midtown - was confirmed less than a week before the actual event, meetings piled on top of one another, hundreds of emails were soon left unanswered, and as the days passed, the pressure was almost unsurmountable.On the day of the hackathon, I walked into District CoWork unsure of what to expect. When the attendees began to trickle in, their eager voices discussing possible projects for the day, an unexpected exhilaration filled the room, and through the opening ceremony and workshops that followed, the growing enthusiasm was the only emotional I could feel. The electricity enveloped me, and as I soon stood at the helm of the space, speaking to all of the teams about the pride we felt for their hard work, I knew that I did truly feel the rush of pure happiness.In the months that followed, media attention from the White House, Congress, and even the United Nations followed, alongside our partnership with over 100 schools and more than 5000 students. From raising over $10,000 to finding international sponsorship, the rapid expansion of StuyHacks has been enormously unprecedented, but even so, it\\'s still surreal to me that an offhand suggestion from a naive freshman could have resulted in the formation of one of the most influential organizations I\\'ve ever had the privilege of leading.\"}, {\"index\": 544, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 545, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I can only tread for a little bit longer. I focus on my hands and feet swirling around in vicious little circles to keep my head above the water. It\\'s the only thing that can distract me from the thousands of square feet of open water that surround me on all sides. The waves are so choppy; I can barely see the shore in the distance. I try not to think about the fact that I am alone in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay right before a storm...Oh wait. I\\'m not alone. My capsized beginners\\' sailboat is condescendingly bobbing up and down a few yards away. I refuse to close my eyes. It\\'ll only allow my terrified imagination to run wild. Scared. Vulnerable. Helpless. I feel sick. I swim against the angry waves over to my boat. Frustrated and working with the help of adrenaline, I use my 110 pound body mass as leverage to turn the boat upright. The coast guard sees my newly erect boat all alone and soon sends a rescue ship to get me.I used my experience as a failed sailor as inspiration to overcome the fear and vulnerability associated with helplessness. I started practicing Kenpo Karate. I was not in constant mortal danger, but learning and practicing Kenpo gave me a sense of internal safety that diminished my fear of being powerless. I continued with martial arts, placing in national competitions, and beating the boys in my sparring class. Today, I am a third degree brown belt, and I am finally confident in my ability to protect myself. Unfortunately not everyone has that luxury. I saw kids like me, who were unable to stand up for themselves, and I saw in them a familiar young girl out in the open water of the Chesapeake Bay. So I became a karate teacher at my karate school. I taught boys and girls from 5-16 years old the basics and even advanced techniques of martial arts because I wanted to give them the same internal security that I desperately craved.I once again saw this vulnerability and helplessness in a fictional situation. As a defense attorney on my school\\'s Mock Trial team and I represented a highschool boy who was accused of murdering his band mate. He was young and fairly unaware of his rights and the justice system scared and confused him. It was his own personal Chesapeake Bay.While I knew this was a fictional case, the sentiment behind it was real. My experiences with defenselessness have been influential in my desire to help alleviate this feeling in other people. I aspire to be a criminal defense attorney in the future. As a mock trial attorney, I see defendants as those who are helplessly stuck in their situations without proper guidance or protection. People believe, like I did, that they are in over their heads and all alone in an unfamiliar environment. I am determined to give support and protection to those without it. To help them navigate the unknown. To help them present themselves in a way that others can understand. Alone, defendants do not have much help getting their side of the story out to use as defense. As an attorney, I will be committed to ensuring that my clients do not feel lost, stranded, and terrified of the unknown: whether that be their rights, the legal process, or in my case the Chesapeake Bay.\"}, {\"index\": 546, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 547, \"new_personal_statement\": \"One of the first dances I ever performed was a trio with my two best friends: a frivolous, cheerful number with far too many sequins, gauzy handkerchiefs disguising the awkwardness of our skinny arms. Backstage, we trembled in terror at the prospect of presenting ourselves in front of the friends we had so foolishly invited. But it was too late to worry about how embarrassed I felt telling people I did Chinese dance, too late to worry about our distinctly foreign (and undeniably Chinese) music and costumes, and too late to worry about our choreography, the facial expressions and wild gestures that made even us giggle. Because then it was our turn: smiling through our teeth for dear life, we blinked hard in the lights that seemed harsher than before, doing our best not to recoil from the dark mass of whispering grandparents and chattering toddlers.Somehow, we survived\\\\u2014and we kept coming back for more. For six days a week, Hengda Dance Academy was home to dozens of girls like me: Chinese-Americans, otherwise estranged from our heritage, seeking to rediscover it here. On the scarred marley floor, we practiced pli\\\\u00e9s and tendus, panwan and yueliangmen, watching as Chinese water sleeves and fluttering red fans filled the air with floating color. And as we learned the languages of movement, we relearned the languages we had taught ourselves to forget. In that simple studio we breathed in the musky odor of sweat, dust, and exhaustion, and breathed out the scent of camaraderie and shared experience. As we painted on our faces for performances, we recalled all the times tipsy white men not-so-jokingly asked if we were sisters, while other moms at competitions gushed about our \\'fascinating\\' and \\'exotic\\' costumes. And we pondered the way the catcalls we received on the street were doubly disarming because, as we were inevitably reminded, we weren\\'t just girls, we were Asian girls; not just dolls, but China dolls. Dance provided me a community and a context to center these conversations. And over time, dance became a way for me to reconcile the hyphen bridging the ocean between Chinese and American, to somehow take the threads of something long lost and weave them into a cloth more beautiful than before. Distinctive costumes and dozens of ethnic dance styles infused me with an appreciation of the kaleidoscope that is Chinese culture; dance reminded me to find beauty in each toss of the head and flick of the fingers, and to find beauty in myself. I have questions, of course: why, and how, and what it means when we perform the traditional dances of ethnic minorities that Han Chinese had all but exterminated; how our performances of the Tibetan cowgirl or Mongolian bowl dances intersect with disputes that continue to this day. But isn\\'t it better to uncover and investigate than it is to obscure and ignore? And isn\\'t it better that we can at least learn, understand, and appreciate the dances of Tibet and the others, even if dissecting their history and politics isn\\'t nearly as simple? The answers come slowly, but they come all the same. As messy as it can be, the process of figuring out what it means to perform Chinese dance has been for me a vehicle to understanding what it means to be a Chinese woman in America: a dance in itself, to be performed on the stage of the world. I\\'ve come to realize that no matter the setting, performance is a process, not a product. It\\'s a journey of exploration, understanding, and self-discovery, and my journey so far has been much more than just learning to move my body. It\\'s been the understanding that Chinese and American aren\\'t mutually exclusive; it\\'s been an awareness of how social location shapes experience. And it\\'s become a way to move forward: I think I\\'m ready for this show to begin. The Washington Student Math Association\\'s mission statement is as ambitious as it is vague, but the nebulous prospect of \\'empowering the next generation of problem solvers\\' seemed to fourteen-year-old me a noble cause. My childhood was punctuated by the clatter of tangrams and rattle of dice, and I explored the world of math not through worksheets and textbooks but through puzzles and number games. I was lucky to have teachers and family who went out of their way to make this possible, so when a friend invited me to one of WSMA\\'s meetings, I accepted immediately--it seemed only fitting to make a similar experience accessible to others. A few years later, after a couple cycles of updating our online competition database and running multiple iterations of our flagship math competition, I looked around and realized that I wasn\\'t quite sure exactly who we were making math accessible for. WSMA\\'s services were largely tailored to those who already had an interest in competitive math--and therefore, those who more often than not ended up being upper-middle-class and white or Asian. This, I thought, begged the question of who we thought \\'the next generation of problem solvers\\' really was. Debate had recently armed me with an ever-broadening awareness of racial and socioeconomic disparities, particularly in educational settings; I thought it imperative that we rectify our approach. I thought I would be a socially-conscious changemaker, eventually shifting the direction of our entire organization. So at one of our next meetings, I proposed a new program: monthly \\'workshops.\\' These were supposed to function as free math enrichment for older elementary and middle school students, thereby compensating for pricey math competition bootcamps and test-prep courses. Ultimately, this would make higher-level competition more feasible for those who wouldn\\'t otherwise participate. I wasn\\'t the only one excited about this idea, so in a flurry of activity, our team designed curriculum, arranged logistics, and published advertising.Our first workshop had excellent attendance--well over 20 students--but we saw worryingly little demographic change. Only 10 kids came to the second, and by the third, we were down to 6. After a fourth with exactly 0 participants, we cancelled the series. With bubbles burst and egos bruised, we began to dissect what went wrong. Our lesson plans were prohibitively difficult for our intended age group, which was probably too broad to begin with. And crucially, the program placed the onus on the students to seek out each workshop, when our intended group happened to be the least inclined to do so. Instead of diffusing competition math as the end goal, we reinforced it. In our haste to get things done, we failed to recognize that the problems we were trying to solve were far more complex than we had considered; a few well-intended competition workshops wouldn\\'t even scratch the surface.For me, these workshops drastically revised my approach to pursuing social change. They forced me to confront the hubristic expectation that any single campaign would magically change the world overnight, and reminded me that lofty goals had to be balanced with reality. They taught me to slow down, and reminded me that effective solutions require careful analysis of the bigger picture. Because while I was trying to make competition math accessible, I forgot that there was so much more to problem-solving than that. But I\\'m not done--and nor is WSMA. This year, we\\'re piloting a program that provides grants to math teachers in Washington. I\\'m cautiously optimistic: after extensive research and preparation, I think we\\'ve come up with something that is truly accessible. It accounts for need, and allows us to directly support the classroom math experience. Our budget may be limited, but we have the potential to affect far more students--especially those not already interested in math.Because the next generation of problem solvers should be anyone and everyone; it\\'s our job to make that ideal as real as possible.\"}, {\"index\": 548, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Palms, Passes, and PCRThey say the only rule of magic is to never tell the audience the secret of the trick.

I used to sit in front of my mirror for hours, scrutinizing my hands as I tried to master the 52-card deck.I came to view the deck as a system. The cards compose their own sort of cell, governed by inviolable rules and laws, utterly dynamic, and beautiful. Unlike a real cell, however, this system is both finite and fully understood.In the summer prior to my sophomore year, I traded in my familiar repertoire of card sleights\\\\u2014passes, shuffles, lifts, breaks, palms, changes, and deals. Transfections, western blots, real-time PCR, luciferase reporter assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and MTT assays instead became my tools of choice.

A magician can read any number of instructional books, but only in the hands of the great prestidigitators does a \\'trick\\' become magic. Similarly, each cell contains a full set of instructions, the full genome, but depending on how the instructions are read, a new trick is performed. Hepatocytes, neurons, beta cells, oocytes (and so forth) are each a different expression of the same source material.Sometimes the trick is performed incorrectly, what a molecular biologist might call \\'disease conditions.\\' Cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer\\'s and heart disease, and any number of other diseases can be boiled down, in large part, to an incorrectly performed trick.After years of performing, I\\'m now in the audience.

Every day after school, I would set up the experiment. Then, on Results Day, I would arrive in the morning, spend the entire day at the lab, and by late in the evening, I would have results, or I would have nothing at all. Afterwards, my mother would question me hopefully.\\'Well, what did you find?\\' Often, the answer was nothing. Not negative results, not unexpected results, but simply no results at all. I\\'d have to shift my seat. Try another angle.I remember sitting in front of the biosafety cabinet as I prepared a transfection for yet another experiment. I saw my reflection in sterile glass.

After an obligatory \\'Hi Mom!\\', I set about gathering materials to fuel my latest experiment: loose sheets of paper and paper clips. Today, my music teacher had presented John Cage and the prepared piano. I sat, captivated, as I watched a man place mundane objects, such as brass nails and strips of plastic, on and between the strings of his piano. Cage defied convention, a quality that my younger self resonated with. Of course, I had to try this \\'prepared piano\\' for myself. Armed with my imagination, I toyed around with different combinations. I discovered that paper creates an eerie timbre and that when I applied greater pressure on the paper, the vibration of the strings decreases, creating a sound that emulates a harpsichord. Though years have passed, that day remains ingrained in my memory; the rush of euphoria and the intrigue that sprung forth from my venture is a sensation that I treasure in all my endeavors. Curiosity sustains me and breathes innovation into my pursuits, pushing me to explore how music translates into emotion (How have our minds grown to associate diminished chords with dissonance?).

Three hours later, blinded by the computer screen\\'s glow, I shut my eyes, rub them, shake my head-- and keep going. I\\'m not done, will never be done, but I somehow can\\'t stop reading, and copying, and pasting, and adding to the tree-- until I fall asleep in my chair.The early days of my six-year-history with genealogy began the chain-reaction which landed me amidst the explosive wonders of the research process. And, though my passion for genealogy has subsided to an occasional hobby, the roots which that obsession spread have taken me into the French Revolution, the books of Isabel Allende, chemical baking reactions, and so many more. When I begin to read one book, I find myself reading the author\\'s others, for background information. When I bake a chocolate cake, I experiment with new amounts of oil and applesauce, searching for the perfect equilibrium. When I began to love Spanish, I jumped into French, using both languages to supplement and strengthen my understanding of conjugations and phrases. When I write a paper on Joseph Conrad\\'s subtle feminism, I hunt down feminist critiques of his work, and analyze the differences between other thoughts and my own. In essence, I research my way through the world-- and add in more data to supplement my own knowledge.When I lose the trail, and ruin a cake or essay with my experimentation, I jump in the next time with even more fervor... though let\\'s face it, strawberry-chocolate frosting is a bit beyond the realms of sanity. Thus, when I return to my genealogical research today, I never have a true -- or clear -- starting place. Sometimes I\\'m on my mother\\'s side, sometimes my father\\'s, and sometimes I jump into research from a completely unrelated branch of the global forest... but each piece of the puzzle, no matter how insignificant, brings me one step closer to knowledge: and each keystroke, one closer to the awe-inspiring melting pot that is our collective story.The genealogical process isn\\'t perfect. Strange things often happen across the cyber-plains of family history, and connections often pop up out of nowhere, destroying connections that I\\'d previously seen as incontrovertible. But it\\'s that quality of spontaneity which charms me-- the potential for disaster from a single mistake, the potential to change everything we know about our past, to move forward into the future. And, somehow, those lessons have stayed in my mind for all of this time. I hope to make my own future-- to change the field of bioethics, and our understanding of scientific advancement. I hope to fight for my opinions, to challenge the status quo, and to dream of new ways to bring understanding of the ethics of science to the population. In that future, any small thing could change our understanding of scientific thought--- any small discovery could force a complete re-creation of our ethical ideals. But as my genealogical research has taught me, that\\'s only to be expected--- and if our ideals cannot be challenged, then they cannot be trusted. \"}, {\"index\": 554, \"new_personal_statement\": \"The air around my lunch table felt hot and pretentious. Volunteer logs were due that afternoon, and with it an excuse to boast about my 9th grade accomplishments made its way into my mind. I wasted no time in bragging about my hundreds of volunteer hours, several leadership positions, and multiple academic trophies. Instead of congratulating my friends on their own commendable works, I mocked and trivialized them. Beyond this immaturity that I now deeply regret, there was a sad reality to my situation. I was a victim and proponent of a culture that required my peers and me to spend hours of our time doing things we cared nothing about for the sole purpose of our image, rank, and perceived definition of success. This began to change when I talked with one of my cousins in India. Over dosas and idlees, we discussed the Indian education system \\\\u2013 an institution that runs on competition, memorization, and regurgitation \\\\u2013 and how much better the system in the United States was. I realized then that despite being blessed with the freedom to choose what I wanted to pursue and occupy myself with, my plight was no better than hers. I was on dull youth boards, volunteered sporadically at odd locales, and participated in clubs I did not enjoy. There was nothing in my life that made me jump out of bed, and I could only blame my choices for that. Between watching science documentaries and shows, participating in science camps, and running silly at-home experiments, I knew that I had a deep interest in science. And because I wanted to actually do something meaningful with it, I applied for a job at the Pacific Science Center. The three years I have spent there have hardly felt like a job.A year after being hired, I was at my booth in the Astronomy area presenting my research on Kidney Stone Detection in Space. I was sitting on my knees, helping a little girl dissolve some sodium borate in water to make a model kidney stone. While stirring vigorously, the girl spilled some solution on her princess dress, and promptly began to cry. Seeing the embarrassment in the daughter and her mother, I quickly said, \\'Don\\'t worry, it\\'s just detergent,\\' and tipped some solution onto my work polo for effect. We all broke into laughter. From my years of experience teaching computers, I put together a Scratch and Arduino tutorial for a new station at the Center. One day, I was showing a father and son how to program a potentiometer to steer an on-screen car. My lunch break was in 5 minutes, but I continued to program with the family for another half hour. Before they eventually left, and before I realized I had missed half of lunch, the 7 year old hugged me and the father shook my hand and smiled.A few months ago, I walked up to my boss\\'s office with a USB key and my tablet. I had spent my free time from the last few weeks coding an algorithm that would automatically create the Science Center\\'s daily schedule \\\\u2013 something that had been always done by hand. The Center had been trying to get such an algorithm made for years, but simply did not have the budget for it. What I made in a few weeks will continue to save the Center hundreds of hours.I realize now that this is my passion. Improving and inspiring people\\'s lives with science and technology is my passion. I discovered it at the Pacific Science Center, and have been running with it since. I find that I do not need to occupy myself with proving that I am the best, as competition for the sake of competition \\\\u2013 and not growth - is pointless. Clubs, classes, hobbies, and jobs \\\\u2013 everything I do now revolves around my passion and this idea, with absolutely no room for trophies.\"}, {\"index\": 555, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 556, \"new_personal_statement\": \"I grew up in nature. Most of my experiences and interests were derived from my humble, rural upbringing and the majority of that time was spent in the wilderness. It often took tugging me by the shirt collar to get me back inside. I love everything about the natural world and that\\'s exactly why I choose to study Environmental and Sustainability Sciences.My father and I loved to go down to the creek near my hometown to fish when I was a boy. Since I had the attention span of a toddler when it came to fishing, I would normally be turning over every rock and floating around every bend in the stream within an hour. I absolutely reveled in the thought of what I would find. It was such an incredible feeling. Thinking about how Earth and life worked so intricately together to create the world that I grew up in\\\\u2026 it drove my imagination wild! However, as I grew older, I learned that this wasn\\'t a common memory. Some people will never know the sight of crawdads hunkering under rocks or the sound of barred owls hooting out to their mates in the night. What a tragic reality it will be when these kinds of experiences are truly gone. Some people have grown so detached from nature that the thoughts of extinction or deforestation seem like natural cycles. This so-called \\'extinction of experience\\' feels to me like a looming shadow threatening future generations.My mission throughout life has been exploring and sharing the wonders of nature with others. This is especially true with regards to my friends and my community who may have never had the chance to discover these wonders on their own. My friends are always surprised to hear that birdwatching is one of my favorite hobbies. When I talk to them about it, they are blown away by the idea that something as foreign as seagulls would fly right through our home in Kansas. They would be quicker to believe that Kansas is just a big, flat square with no environmental value at all.I believe that to save and conserve nature, society must first understand it. I\\'ve made education and outreach my mission in life, but to achieve this I have to know more about the world myself. I intend to study at Cornell under professors like Marianne Krasny and Kristi Sullivan who engage the general public and offer practical approaches to conservation. Cornell would also offer an academic setting that would allow me to learn from and connect with peers from other branches of arts and science. In the future, I would love to establish an organization that collaborates with artists of all types to inform people about various environmental crises and with scientists from all fields to solve unique problems that nature faces.\"}, {\"index\": 557, \"new_personal_statement\": \"Like any other individual, I am content among my peers. However, \\'peers\\' does not simply refer to those in my grade or of my age; instead, they are the people who \\'never yawn or say a commonplace thing but burn, burn, burn\\' with an insatiable desire for passion, compassion, and\\\\u2026 (Kerouac)I used to believe peers were merely those who shared my thirst for understanding. Academic Competition, a class devoted to learning for the sake of knowledge, seemed nothing short of paradise. Receiving hundreds of pages of condensed information to absorb every few weeks, I began to appreciate the astounding amount of things I had yet to learn.Never before had such like-minded people surrounded me. Previously sufficient motivation was replaced with an unrelenting and pulsating drive towards self-betterment. Inspired by others doing the same, I began the arduous process of learning how to learn. I took online classes on Coursera, with topics ranging from organic chemistry to cosmology; I read textbooks on statistics and biology, testing myself with AP examinations; I devoured the compiled material for every Science Bowl topic\\\\u2014biology, physics, geology, astronomy, and chemistry\\\\u2014and later dabbled in literature, mythology, and oceanography. I was desperate to understand the fascination underlying each field, and this catalyzed my journey into the age-old pursuit of knowledge, this perpetual quest to answer, \\'Why?\\'.However, I came to realize it was not only mutual intellectual passion that created this sense of satisfaction. I thought I would enjoy a two-week camp preparing for the International Biology Olympiad, but to my dismay found people there so focused on winning, absorbed in their own textbooks, that they became selfish, often reluctant or entirely unwilling to help each other learn. Though they were indeed passionate, I was not content; therefore, these could not be my peers in anything more than a conventional sense.Later that year, I found what I had sought at the Summer Science Program. There, I attended over a hundred hours of math, physics, programming and astronomy lectures, and observed an asteroid to ultimately determine its orbit. There were no tests or grades, and although nothing enforced the completion of our work, we all relished the challenge. I connected with these people\\\\u2014my peers and friends\\\\u2014over nightly problem set collaboration and discussions at the Very Large Array about dark matter candidates as we marveled in awestruck wonder at the world around us. We were all there for one another, sharing struggles and accomplishments alike. It was another paradise, an oasis in the New Mexico desert.I thus came to understand the essential traits of true peers: both a fervor for learning and genuine compassion. The former creates the infectious curiosity that defines humanity; the latter cultivates a sense of belonging through the smallest of gestures, such as holding open a door. Together, they create a certain indefinable, indomitable spirit: this network of people supporting one another facilitates discovery in an environment where failures become but transient setbacks. People are willing to put aside personal obligations to help the entire group, and in doing so they help themselves. My peers also become role models, inspiring me towards constant improvement. It is not that I lack self-confidence; rather, I learn from others\\' accomplishments and hope to affect them with a similar passion. This dynamic equilibrium allows for the opportunity to simultaneously teach and learn, focusing intently while having fun. In these communities, we throw ourselves toward a common goal with wild abandon, knowing we are never alone in this mad pursuit, and this is what pushes me farther than I think possible, teaching me to learn and live to the fullest.I found contentment is not complacency\\\\u2014it is the lack of it. It is the continual drive to learn, help others, and improve the world along the way. It is the embarking on a voyage of intra- and inter- personal discovery, and I shall continue seeking it.\"}, {\"index\": 558, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] My left hand flips the well-worn page of a tattered score while my right hand sways in four-four time. A cursory glance reveals a crescendo for the trumpet section. Signaling the imaginary orchestra, my left hand sweeps out in a wide arc to indicate the change in dynamics. A hasty scribble in the receding white space of the score marks the trumpet passage for further examination later. This marathon of a piece finally transitions into a full-on sprint as the invisible musicians and I near the end in an explosion of energy and sound. With the definitive blast of cannons, the piece comes crashing to a close. Pausing for a moment, I read through the notes written in the margins of the score, then smile and place it back on its spot on my bookshelf.Seven years ago at my elementary school graduation, I received a copy of Tchaikovsky\\'s 1812 Overture from my choir teacher. At the time it seemed an odd gift choice, especially to an 11 year-old who struggled through single line treble music. It was a gift that took time and maturity to fully appreciate. Thus it sat, gathering dust, on my bookshelf until the summer of 8th grade. I had just gotten home, dusty and disappointed, from a baseball game. Looking for something to distract me from the loss, my eyes fell upon the score that had sat, undisturbed, for years. I cracked the spine, popped in the accompanying CD, and sprawled across my chair. As pizzicato strings softly outlined the initial melody, I was drawn further into the beauty of the piece with each pluck. Fluttering along the little trails blazed by the violins or mucking in the lower registers with the contrabasses, I was amazed by how many feelings a composer could convey solely through sound. As the screaming brass, wailing strings, and, finally, the discharge of cannons signaled the end, goosebumps ran up and down my arms. I had listened to plenty of music before, but nothing had spoken to me as viscerally as this piece. I sat in silence for a moment to grasp what had happened before carefully summarizing my feelings amongst the final stanzas.In the following weeks, I returned to the score and surrendered myself to its power whenever I was feeling stressed or sad. Those weeks turned into months and those months into years. As I began to progress musically, I started to make performance notes in the score: add a crescendo there; make those notes staccato; tell the bassoonist to bring out the lower notes to complete the chord. Sometimes a section of the piece would perfectly capture the emotions I was feeling in the moment and I would make a detailed note. Over time the margins filled up with notes on score interpretation, emotions, and memories.Dusting off the old score sparked a keen interest in music in me. From Tchaikovsky, I discovered Liszt. He introduced Rimsky-Korsakov, who led to Chopin, Bach, and many others. When listening wasn\\'t enough, I graduated to conducting in my room. I imagined an orchestra following my every baton flick and tempo change, which, occasionally, garnered confused looks from my family. I eventually built up confidence in my abilities, and endeavoured to bring my conducting to the stage. With great excitement, I secured a slot in the Upper School spring concert. When the time came for my ensemble to perform, I was euphoric. I tapped my baton on the podium and suddenly the hours spent conducting in my room came to fruition. Standing in front of a group of musicians and sharing the intricacies of each piece I worked so hard to perfect, I was brought back to my first encounter with Tchaikovsky. My hands swayed in four-four time, the timpanis rumbled furiously, and I was awash in the same organic joy that was first heralded by the blast of cannons.  \"}, {\"index\": 559, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Alexis RiddickOverlap or Paradox For me, fairy tales revolved around the books themselves more than the princesses, so I became fascinated with telling stories. Society was that evil stepmother who crushed my dreams by telling me that black girls couldn\\'t speak outside of their stereotyped vernacular. I thought \\'properly\\' about chapters, sentences, and prologues, but I could not let these words escape for fear of being chastised. My heritage was my tragic flaw. I could not reconcile my tendency to not always use slang with the fact that as a black female, I am expected to be improper. Society enforced African American Vernacular English (AAVE), also known as ebonics. She told me to use \\'you wrong\\' more than \\'you are incorrect,\\' and \\'why you trippin\\'?\\' more than \\'why would you do such a thing?\\' \\'Proper\\' speech, apparently, was a white thing, and I of course, as a black female, was unworthy of a choice. She screamed \\'know your place\\' as I bled, reminding me that as a black person, I was wrong for the world, but as a quiet, \\'unconventional\\' black woman, I was also wrong for my own racial community. I still carry the bruises from my fellow Kindergarteners\\' proclamations that I talked \\'funny.\\' Even years later, friends sewn from the same dark-colored fabric as me accused me of adding too much white to the pattern. \\'You\\'re such an Oreo,\\' this one black girl said, with the agreement of other non-black classmates, meaning I was black on the outside, but white on the inside. I was a seventh grader, finally and fully aware of what it meant to be the target of a joke, and yet expected to stay silent in fear of being labeled \\'overly sensitive.\\' I was living a double life: I shared Webster dictionary-like conversations with my teachers, but words like \\'ain\\'t\\' and \\'finna\\' with my cousins. I corrected my own grammar constantly in anyone\\'s presence, and these self-corrections came with the implication that \\'black\\' speech or AAVE was wrong. Perhaps even that blackness, or even the association with it, was wrong. I became so terrified of speaking out of line -- or more specifically the color line -- that starting in eighth grade, I turned to writing as my way of storytelling. My poems, as oreos themselves -- a mix of black ink and white paper -- understood me.. I also understood my poems, and consequently, I began to understand myself. Ebonics were not \\'improper,\\' and the words one uses in casual conversations do not define one\\'s intelligence nor do they dictate the words someone uses in a formal essay or dissertation. Perhaps the beauty was not in speaking \\'white\\' or \\'black,\\' but in speaking in the first place, in writing, in choosing.I now see myself as the knot being pulled in a tug-of-war of definitions. Is it possible to be just a black woman who does not primarily use ebonics, or is it contradictory? Am I an overlap or a paradox? The latter is prevalent, whereas the first is revolutionary. Only now at the peak of my adolescence am I deciding to start choosing: my existence is legitimate. Poetry is silent resistance: alliteration serves solely as a social sanctuary for the silenced, stanzas as breaks from the terror of subtle racism, and metaphors are steps on the moon -- too few, but all the more impactful. So I self-identify as a poet: I have won wars with words, lost past lives, and learned so much by following my own lesson plans. Heroism does not lie with only those who fight the battles, but with those who write about the battles they have fought. My bruises are battle wounds. The tale of the quiet black female is not a conventional one of tragic heroism -- I was not slaughtered by the perceptions of my race. I rose from it. \"}, {\"index\": 560, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 561, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Boy Scouts: The Musical Mother Nature has never been my friend. Many find solace in her serene evening breezes and pure blue skies, but not me. She commands hordes of mosquitos to gnaw on my legs and clouds of pollen to invade my nostrils, making a seemingly perfect day utterly unenjoyable. What did I ever do to spur this animosity between us? I tried ignoring this contentious relationship by joining the Boy Scouts of America, a club that exposed me to the outdoors in harsh weekend expeditions, in the hope of forcing myself to befriend my long-time foe. The organization\\'s promise of athleticism and spiritual harmony intrigued me, but even after seven years of setting up tents and starting fires, I felt no different; the other boys felt physically stimulated by these activities, but I never found them particularly engaging. Whatever spark of interest was initially present had been long extinguished, and all I wanted to do was quit.But I, along with every other child, was taught to persevere. Each of my teachers hung colorful signs displaying the iconic \\'if at first you don\\'t succeed, try harder\\' motto. While this proverb may hold true in some situations, at age thirteen, I needed to outgrow the elementary concept that persevering was going to solve all my problems; simply \\'trying harder\\' could not force me to enjoy or excel in anything. The issue, however, was not how to survive in the wilderness every weekend, but rather how to survive the extreme pressure placed on me by others. I was surrounded by adults who pushed me to try every possible club, insisting that I follow through with these commitments regardless of scheduling issues or conflicting interests. If it looked good on a r\\\\u00e9sum\\\\u00e9, somehow my parents could ignore an activity\\'s faults, applying their idea of perseverance to persuade them of this.The longer I remained in Boy Scouts, the less enthusiastic I felt about pursuing my other interests. While I wanted to take piano lessons and attend musical rehearsals, it was difficult to divert the necessary attention towards these activities. Boy Scouts kept me bound to a rigid schedule, and I was inadvertently placed in an uncomfortable environment. Every time I convinced myself it was officially time to quit, I kept retracting to the advice of my parents, my own concerns and misconceptions of the future holding me back. What if I disappoint them? What if I suddenly enjoy Boy Scouts? My insecurities kept me bound to what was safe, and although I was miserable, I felt more comfortable suffering than having to thrust myself into a new environment. But then I opened my eyes. I noticed jocks turning to set design and artists joining mock trial, and I realized that I did not have to follow the template others constructed for me. I should only partake in what makes me happy, and although I was sure my parents would have loved to see me as an accomplished Boy Scout, I was more sure that they would hate to see me suffer through any experience. For me, persevering only has personal worth while pursuing something that I love, and I simply did not love Boy Scouts enough to stay. Although it was overwhelming to challenge my current routine, I knew I had to focus on my true areas of interest. Thus, I decided to exchange my merit badges and camping gear for a piano and jazz shoes; I quit Boy Scouts.For the thousands of adventurers who have held on through every knot-tying escapade and iron-on badge and rain-soaked tent, I salute you. As for me, I am perfectly content sticking to some more artistic--and indoor--endeavors.  \"}, {\"index\": 562, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]         It\\'s hard to imagine life without clean water, insulated housing, and readily available health care. Ecuadorian villagers live this life every day. During this past summer, I joined a medical humanitarian effort as a health teacher to teach hygienic habits to these Ecuadorian villagers. During my time in the Ecuadorian highlands, I tried my best to offer services to the Ecuadorians who had limited access to severely strained medical facilities. When I first landed in Ecuador, I was amazed to see the modern airport and the surrounding roads, and I commented to my sister that it looked like we had never left the United States. However, as asphalt roads turned to gravel and gravel turned into uneven dirt, I quickly realized that my assumption was completely false. In my first few days there, I learned about the political and historical oppression of the indigenous people and their frequent riots against the government in Ecuador due to the strains of poor sanitation, housing, and overall quality of life. Each day, I taught in a makeshift classroom and was fascinated to see that my students, although hardened by harsh conditions, came prepared to learn about hygienic practices such as brushing teeth. As they walked into my classroom, I noticed their harsh reality of missing teeth, calloused and wrinkled skin, and a leanness to their figures. Even though their water supply was infested with parasites, many were never taught how to avoid them. Reviewing and using the Spanish I studied in school, I communicated the importance of habits such as the proper timing for washing hands to prevent food contamination and infections. Many of our deliberations quickly digressed into warm conversations about how they lived and about the weather in Ecuador, and they asked me about my home. After some laughs and smiles, I felt a genuine connection with most of the people I encountered.  After each day and each presentation, I became more confident and comfortable in my teaching. I began excitedly greeting students and other volunteers with an \\'Hola!\\' as they entered my classroom, even if they weren\\'t as gung ho as I was. During the lessons, I guided their brushing techniques with a comically large toothbrush and set of dentures, and then, I would let them practice all by themselves. Boy scouts like me call this the EDGE method which stands for Explain, Demonstrate, Guide, and Enable. Some of my students stayed longer than they needed to because they seemed to enjoy my company, care, and conversation. Couples brought children, and we even visited a preschool where I rubbed children\\'s teeth with fluoride in order to protect their teeth from tooth decay. We inflated balloons for most kids, and some were ecstatic to play with us. Seeing these children so joyous after learning and receiving treatments let us know that our work was brightening their days. Through simple acts of kindness, mutual respect, and communication, we, as people, can connect with each other even though we come from different nations and cultures. Sharing my knowledge with others who weren\\'t as fortunate was an eye-opening experience for me because I felt extremely driven being a difference maker for others and bringing joy to them, even for just a few minutes. I want to give people a sense of hope for improvement in their lives by showing my care for them. However, I realize that I can help others and make them feel cared for wherever I am living and in many different ways. My experience in Ecuador, in totality, has fortified my yearning to create a better situation for others by becoming a teacher, a research scientist, or a health care professional. \"}, {\"index\": 563, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Prompt: The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?Baking, thankfully, isn\\'t passed down through the genes. My mother had the audacity to give me a look of surprise when she halved the butter and got rock-hard cookies in return. (\\'But it\\'s healthy!\\' she cried out.)I was drawn to baking because of its elegance (ingredients so different in taste and texture combine in various ways to end up looking nothing like what it started out as!), and started baking at a young age. Baking is great because it\\'s something that I can do for my friends, so that I can give homemade presents, not just a card and not only on special occasions. It also gives me a reason to call my friends over, to bake together. When I\\'m doing it for myself, baking biscotti at 6 a.m. makes me feel productive, especially when I can actually get very tangible, tasty goods that directly result from whatever effort I put in.Thanks to my mother\\'s cookie fiasco, I was adamant about sticking to the recipe when I first started baking. I was always extra careful to level the flour and pack the sugar. If the recipe called for butter, then butter it must be, and I worried incessantly about doing each step perfectly. Before this year, I kept using the same recipes and made only cookies and brownies because they were safe. Baking a basic chocolate cake on nine different occasions and failing each time (once the cake was burnt on the outside and raw on the inside, and another time it actually caught fire) convinced me not to try anything harder.My attitude towards baking only changed last year, when I did my 6-month research project. Generally, lab work requires greater precision than baking since we want everything to be perfectly methodical and replicable. Addition of reagents is done with calibrated pipettes. Each reagent usually has a specific function too, even if it\\'s only a small amount that\\'s used. I had to re-cast a polyacrylamide gel when I realised that it wasn\\'t solidifying because I had forgotten to add 1.5 \\\\u00b5l of TEMED, which catalyzes the polymerisation of acrylamide, to the 5 ml mixture. Still things went wrong all the time. I was forced to do PCR (polymerase chain reaction) more than 1000 times in November and December to amplify and detect our DNA samples. Each batch (usually 32 samples each time) takes 3 hours in total. We tried to troubleshoot and optimise the procedure, but I still have the results to prove that sometimes, even when we used the same reagents and conditions, we could get different results. Nevertheless, with each attempt we crossed out another possibility and got one step closer to what we wanted. Different experiments also showed me that some reagents are just for visualization purposes and don\\'t interfere with the sample, like how chocolate chips don\\'t affect the cookie itself. Knowing what each part of a protocol is for saves a lot of time, and sometimes I could even salvage samples I had forgotten to add a reagent to by tweaking the protocol. In baking, too, when I discovered halfway that I\\'d run out of flour, I quickly changed to a flourless brownie recipe, modifying it a little. And now that I know that butter doesn\\'t just make cookies softer, but imparts flavor and, depending on the way it\\'s used, texture too, I prefer to use recipes that call for butter rather than oil or shortening. Baking became less stressful and more efficient when I stopped obsessing over cups and spoons that didn\\'t really matter.Baking isn\\'t meant to be easy, nor are recipes meant to be a rigid set of rules to follow. There\\'s so much knowledge accessible now thanks to Google and people who bake 1,536 cookies to find their own chocolate chip cookies, but there\\'s nothing like trying to bite a rock-hard cookie to learn how it really works. \"}, {\"index\": 564, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I think about the converging waves of the notes I play, the standing waves being created by plucking a string, and the physics behind the air pockets being forged that eventually find a listening ear whenever I sit down to play my bass. Thus, my passions of math and music synergistically become more together than they could ever be apart. I started thinking about this when a former math teacher of mine approached me one afternoon and asked me if I was interested in giving the induction speech at the Mu Alpha Theta induction ceremony. Being a member of the honor society and recounting the memorable induction speech given the year prior at my own induction, I wholeheartedly agreed. I decided on the topic of music and math because I play upright bass in the orchestra and electric bass in the jazz ensemble and being a math enthusiast, it is impossible for me not to see the mathematics and physics present in music.At music\\'s core, math is present in the tempo and rhythm of a piece, with the time signature being represented as a fraction and the tempo being represented by a numerical value in beats per minute. The relationship between the two gets even more intriguing when applied to actual notes being played. The best sounding music is that which uses flawless mathematics. It is common knowledge that each note has a letter name\\\\u2014A through G\\\\u2014but also has a number value, measured in hertz. An A4 for instance is 440 hertz. In Beethoven\\'s \\'Moonlight Sonata,\\' there exist triads in triplet form. These triads are made up of D, F#, and A. Since sound is a vibrational energy, notes can be graphed as sine functions. When the triad notes are graphed, they intersect at their starting point and at the point 0.042. At this point the D has gone through two full cycles, the F# two and a half, and the A three. This results in consonance, something that sounds naturally pleasant to the ear. Thinking about this opened my eyes to all the aspects of my life with which I utilize math to enhance. There is also an incredible amount of unseen math present in football. At 5 foot 10 inches and 160 pounds with pads on, I fall short of the average player at my position who is usually at least 6 feet tall and well over 200 pounds, so applying math to football is intellectually stimulating, but is more importantly a survival mechanism. When I have to go up against an opponent who is over twice my size and looks like he eats freshmen for lunch, brute force is not on my side and it helps having equations for momentum and attack angle running through my head. Math not only helps me survive, but also thrive. As an opponent running back is darting down the sideline with seemingly cheetah-like speed, I can trust that my angles and velocity will allow me to make the play and possibly save a game-changing touchdown. Or when a ball is sailing through the air caught in the stadium lights, I can picture a projectile motion problem with constant acceleration downward and a near constant velocity in the x-direction, and know that I have a leg up on the player next to me who does not think about it the way I do. When I look at aspects of my life in a math context, they make more sense and make things that I love even better and more enjoyable. \"}, {\"index\": 565, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I had forgotten about the plastic bowl of greasy, buttery popcorn in my hands. I\\'m left staring at an empty expanse of screen, mouth open at the grayscaled room. The DVD case for The Usual Suspects taunts me, sitting on the worn coffee table. The film was far from Usual and nothing I would have suspected. Ten minutes later, I\\'m gritting my teeth as I scrape popcorn kernels from between them. My mind wanders back to the film. How did the cop not see it? I pick another kernel and decide to cut the cop some slack; I probably would have missed it too. Finished, I glance up into the mirror. An amused-looking teenager stares back at me. Despite the late hour, he doesn\\'t look tired.But because of the time, I slide into my bed in an attempt to sleep. Instead, I toss and turn, twisting my blankets into a jumbled mess. Moments of the film repeat in my mind, urging me forward into a world of invention, pressing me to write my inspired thoughts onto fresh pages. Surrendering, I sit up and grasp my laptop off the carpet.\\'He brushed the pine needles off his nose. Snow fell in heaps around him, rendering trees into menacing shadows barely visible through the white fall.\\'My blood rushes a hundred miles per hour through my veins as I type away, relaying the story of Viktor \\\\u2014created from the depths of my mind\\\\u2014 to the blank pages on my laptop. Over the course of the night, I become Viktor. Viktor is the Russian chess champion, the mountain climber, the fun and sarcastic party-crasher. I feel his agony as his life almost slips away, the triumph as his opponent signals defeat. After Viktor, Luk\\\\u00e0cs comes along. Then Henrietta. And Isabella. Each character around Viktor has a new persona, a new identity. Yet despite my efforts, Viktor is only a partially excavated fossil, incomplete; he does not have the depth of Verbal Kint from The Usual Suspects.Seconds turn into minutes; minutes become hours. Viktor slowly emerges from layers of rock. Eventually, Viktor gains a voice. A face. A story. He\\'s not blown up on the screen like Verbal but he\\'s just as clear in my head. Satisfied for the time being, I shut the laptop lid and let the glow etched into my eyes slowly fade away. Groggy but cheerful, I rise early the next morning and manage to jot a few notes down before the dreams disappear from my memory. Verbal Kint. Dean Keaton. Kobayashi.I silently congratulate the director for being able to carry the characters off the screen and into my dreams. Because to me, storytelling \\\\u2014 through writing, or film, or music\\\\u2014 is more than art. It\\'s also to take someone, or some story I know, and convey the same emotions it elicits to someone else. Even during late nights, after my popcorn and film ritual, there are feelings I can turn into characters on a page. These newfound stories, stories that allow me to see beyond the suburbia I reside in, are etched into my mind because of film, keeping me up until I can write them down. Last year, I spun Dr. Wells\\'s betrayal in The Flash into an original, short, suburban horror film of duplicity for my English classmates, transforming the feeling I grappled with most from The Flash into its own story. Whether these stories are inspired by The Flash or captured killer whales in Blackfish, there\\'s always something to share. So maybe film won\\'t be my career, but I will always love film for its possibilities. I may not be directing feature films, but as the director of my own life, I\\'m always trying to find a new experience to communicate. Countless bowls of popcorn have greased my fingers and my mind in this pursuit \\\\u2014 but there\\'s still popcorn left to eat. \"}, {\"index\": 566, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] It\\'s 6 am on Thursday and I\\'m half-awake in the back seat of our Toyota, my head resting on my older sister\\'s shoulder. The faint beginnings of the sun greet the four of us as we pull out onto the highway from our neighbourhood. The roads are uncharacteristically quiet, almost eerie. We speed past skyscrapers crisscrossed by empty pavement, leaving behind the normally bustling city of Lagos I call home. When I open my eyes at the top of the hour, the quaint bungalows and low-rise office buildings particular to the neighbouring town of Ibadan have usurped Lagos\\' cityscape.But our journey has not finished yet \\\\u2013 not even close. By 10 o\\'clock the view has metamorphosed into light forests, open grasslands and massive rock formations. We reach the historical town of Ile\\\\u0301-Ife\\\\u0301 and stop briefly on the side of the road to purchase akara (bean cakes) from an elderly woman and her pre-teen daughter. By noon we\\'ve been driving off-road for close to a half-hour. We\\'re close. It\\'s not long before we pull up outside the bungalow my dad grew up in, and I\\'m prostrating for my grandmother in typical Yoruba fashion.I\\'ve made this three hundred mile journey between my two worlds countless times. I live in Lagos, Nigeria, where the towering edifices, crowded streets and me\\\\u0301lange of languages are just a slice of the city. Since birth, I\\'ve been immersed in the unique blend of cultures and ideas of the twenty-one million people I share the title \\'Lagosian\\' with, and I\\'ve relished every second of it. Many weekends in my childhood were spent absorbing all that my megacity has to offer. Like tourists in our own city, my dad and I spent our afternoons eating at the newest \\'Efik\\' restaurant or admiring traditional artwork at the Isale\\\\u0301-Eko market, always eager for more to discover.In stark contrast, my entire family is originally from Iyara, a 500 square mile village in central Nigeria. The small settlement of a few hundred houses, mud huts, a church, a mosque and a town market is our home, one we share with just 200,000 others.For me, the difference between Lagos and Iyara transcends the disparity between city and countryside; they are both central to my identity. Iyara represents my cultural heritage and is an integral part of my individuality. Being part of the Okun culture has fostered a sense of community like no other. We speak an esoteric dialect of Yoruba called \\'Okun\\' and enjoy the nuances of our distinctive village.Lagos, on the other hand, has been the key to my personal and intellectual development. There, I have no shortage of like-minded individuals with whom to interact, as well as those radically different from me. I have been inspired by unique cultures, and exposed to innumerable ideas. Living in such a culturally rich environment has provided me with several opportunities to foster a wide range of interests and intellectual curiosities reflective of the various backgrounds in the city. It\\'s difficult not to be open-minded when you\\'re absorbed in a city like Lagos, where life is defined by an eclectic mix of activities and ideas.Yet despite how influential Lagos and Iyara have been on my identity, the 6-hour journey on my sister\\'s shoulder is the most accurate representation of who I am. The livelihood of the city and the sanctuary of the village are not comically juxtaposed, like two warring ideals, but are connected by the road in-between. As such, it is the journey between the two that unites them. Similarly, my two antithetical identities exist simultaneously but not independently; they are inextricably intertwined to form my personality. Just as the journey is the connection between Lagos and Iyara, I am made up of the connection between my cultural identity and personal and intellectual experiences. \"}, {\"index\": 567, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  A red envelope with golden Chinese characters shimmers underneath the lamp light. I open it and pull out the dollar bill. \\'X\\\\u012bnni\\\\u00e0n ku\\\\u00e0il\\\\u00e8\\', I say to my mom, who attempts to say it back. It\\'s Chinese New Year once again, and through this small gesture, I feel connected to the culture I\\'ve known little about. Though I am biologically Chinese, I don\\'t feel that my cultural identity can be described in just one word.       As a three-day old baby, I was left on the steps of a middle school in Yangchun, China, swaddled in a dirty carpet remnant. China\\'s one child policy mixed with the centuries-old belief that boys are more worthy than girls left millions of Chinese girls homeless. On November 17, 1998, Lynda Martinez, an older, single American adopted one of those orphaned girls. As I was handed over to her, I gripped onto her tenaciously. Somehow I knew that I was on my way to a better place.    Growing up as an adoptee, I was always self-conscious about being different from other kids. Going to back-to-school night was torment. \\'How are you Chinese and your last name is Martinez?\\' \\'That\\'s your mom?\\' I blushed and turned scarlet at the thought of how mismatched my mom with her blue eyes looked next to me with my jet black hair. And when a friend had the nerve to ask me \\'Aren\\'t you sad that your real parents abandoned you?\\' I was speechless. It made me frustrated that people felt even an ounce of pity for me because I didn\\'t feel any for myself. I was irritated that the word \\'Martinez\\' involved so much explanation and I was also confused because I never really identified as Chinese, White or Hispanic. But most of alI, I was disappointed in myself for feeling ashamed of everything that made me unique.     When I walked into the hallway the first day of high school I knew what I was going to face. New people meant the same questions and confused looks. Then one day, everything changed. My friend invited me to a Key Club event and I completely fell in love. I began to think less about myself and more about others. Through community service, I have found the chance to connect and support people who need it the most. Waking up at five a.m. to cheer on 10k runners and operating carnivals for children struggling with leukemia are how I typically spend my Saturday mornings and Sunday afternoons. I wouldn\\'t have my weekends any other way. As the President of Key Club, I am known around school as the \\'optimistic community service girl\\'. I chuckle at the flattering comment, but deep down I know that helping my community has truly made me a happier and more confident person. It reminds me that where I come from isn\\'t what matters, but rather what I do for my world here and now.\\\\u2028 Serving the diverse community of Los Angeles and heading up the Key Club at my school have inspired me to want to study government. Through government service, I will be able to lead and unite people of differing backgrounds for the purpose of creating a more positive world for us all and expressing my profound appreciation for this country. My American story doesn\\'t make me feel depressed or unwanted, but instead reminds me of my strength, perseverance and limitless opportunity I have to fulfill my potential. \"}, {\"index\": 568, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I scanned the board carefully, ensuring the safety of all my pieces. After my act ofdefense, I quickly switched to offense. I have many options. Should attack the pawn? Castle todefend my king? Or sacrifice my knight to attack the bishop? It was early in the chess game andI played aggressively without any strategies. All I knew was that I loved chess and that my dadhated it.When I was 7, I was curious about each chess piece. No one in my family knew whatthey meant - except for my dad. At the time, he was willing to patiently teach me how the gameworks. It was only when I kept demanding to play more than one game every day that he startedto become tired of it. He would come home exhausted from work late at night, greeted by myhuge smile and a chess board already set up. Sometimes he would even be so drained to thepoint where he knocked out at the dinner table we were playing on.In middle school, my dad decided to use chess as an incentive for me. If I achieved highexpectations based on my report card, he would take the time for a game of chess. Every month,I eagerly waited for my report card to take home.In the start of high school, chess was non-existent. I barely ever saw my dad, because hiswork just became more difficult. Therefore, I took the opportunity to create a Chess Club inschool. After writing the constitution for the club, I drew advertisements to invite other studentsto join. Surprisingly, many students with different levels of chess playing were interested! WithHong 1our advisor\\'s help, we learned how to use the clock during the chess game and various tacticssuch as \\'control the center\\' and \\'pinning\\'.Every day I express thanks to my dad, even if he is out at work. He built the foundationof my learning process. Even though he stopped playing chess with me, he believed that I wasready to explore the world independently. Maturity and experience was the result.Chess undoubtedly taught me how to think critically and patiently, which are qualitiesthat need to be sharpened by every doctor and surgeon. Every move counts \\\\u2013 and one mistakecan lead to a downfall. Chess has trained my brain to the point where it can deal with stressingsituations \\\\u2013 and one day, it will deal with the stress required in a surgery operating room. \"}, {\"index\": 569, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] My career aspirations were earnestly impacted by a trip to the Tiger-Leap Gorge, a remote mountain area in northwestern China in the summer of 2013. During my stay, I befriended a 12 year old boy who had to walk six hours daily on narrow mountain roads to attend school. There was no school bus, and dorms were reserved for students who lived eight hours away. Living conditions there were harsh, healthcare scarce. Doctors had limited access to modern medicine. I made a promise then that I would learn the skills necessary to develop technology to help improve the lives of people in remote regions of the world.I decided to start a medical information project in June 2014. The idea hit me after a visit to my pediatrician, where he talked about the benefit of online medical information to his practice. I realized that my pediatrician was using this information passively. For example, his inquiries were often limited to subjects related to his diagnosis. I thought that medical information could be more effectively used if it was integrated into physicians\\' practices. I developed software with a smart filter capable of selectively retrieving medical information related to a patient\\'s medical conditions. I envision a future for medicine where computer software works alongside physicians to perform diagnoses and designs treatment protocols.I created the app, \\'Biomarker,\\' as the first product of my project. It provides medical information on biomarkers (genetic, protein, and cellular markers for diseases), and could serve as a reference guide for physicians. Biomarker was my first large scale software project, taking almost 10 months to complete. There were many struggles and frustrations along the way. The app required implementing a biomarker database (BioDB). When the program was first completed, it didn\\'t work. The BioDB did not link to the app. It turned out that the Android OS automatically rerouted all data requests to its embedded database at a default location. I resolved the issue by removing the default database and adding the necessary codes to redirect requests to the BioDB. The app, however, still did not retrieve data from the BioDB. Combing through thousands of lines of code, I could not find the fault. Frustrated by this \\'hidden\\' bug, I looked for clues in online programming forums. One poster mentioned that the Android OS is incompatible with the language Java 7. It was as if the program was attempting to use instructions written in a foreign language. I took a crash course and translated my codes into Java 6, an Android compatible language. The app ran successfully. Biomarker was published on the Google Play Store.Completing Biomarker gave me the same joy that I experienced when I stood atop Alaska\\'s Harding Icefield. I felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment, euphoria, and pride. The spectacular view of the Harding Icefield\\'s vast white snow/ice glacier extending far beyond the horizon amazed me, and I appreciated the rare opportunity to witness this breathtaking beauty of nature. I realized that scientific explorations are like natural adventures\\\\u2014a search for knowledge of the unknown.Biomarker has given me the confidence to succeed. I plan to develop new features that help doctors practice preventive medicine by identifying biomarkers related to patients\\' medical profiles and assessing their propensities for diseases. With this information, doctors can recommend preventive measures. For example, if a genetic profile suggests a patient is susceptible to heart disease, the app could inform doctors about the preventive drugs and lifestyle changes that would most help the patient. At this stage, I am expanding my technological skills and developing algorithms that implement these features. I must complete these new features and working toward my dream of improving healthcare in remote regions of the world. \"}, {\"index\": 570, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Music is never the same. Performing a style that is so dependent on what others around you create develops a form of music that evolves into a different direction every time. Subtleties disregarded by the common listener are enlarged and used as motives for solos. A \\'daht\\' here becomes a \\'doo-dit\\' there; evolving further as the interaction between a soloist and the rhythm section deepens. Throughout all this, the strong connection between the soloist and the rhythm section is most important. Music has always been a perfect escape for me. When I work on a rudiment, my mind ignores everything going on around me. I become deeply engaged with what I\\'m practicing, and use that to reach peace with myself. I\\'ve always been somewhat of an introvert: I enjoy the company of my friends, but I require time afterwards to restore tranquility; I love playing games with my family, but afterwards I need to sit in my room alone to relax. When I went into high school, I was astounded at how much everything was based off of a social hierarchy. Popularity became a necessity for everything, ranging from where you sat during lunch to how quickly you obtained a partner for projects. This overwhelmed me. Band became my escape because it was easy to drop the social aspect of school and focus on the music. I initially joined my high school\\'s concert band to play classical music with my fellow bandmates. I enjoyed playing this type of music, however at our spring concert, I went into the audience to watch the Jazz Ensemble perform and madly fell in love with jazz. Unlike concert music, it offered spontaneity. It was a much more engaging form of music and allowed me to escape from my every day life. I began to take lessons for the jazz drum set, and joined my school\\'s Jazz 2 Ensemble the following school year. Through this I discovered people like myself who wanted to focus on music instead of the social aspect of high school. As time progressed, I reached out to other jazz ensembles, and met more people whom I could relate to. I created strong connections with them because our common interest in music made everything relatable. Despite music\\'s strong presence in my life, I have not let it become solely what I care about. I dedicate immense amount of time to my schoolwork, attaining straight A\\'s and engaging myself in curriculum that I love. My favorite classes are science classes, specifically biology. I love learning about how living beings have evolved. In addition, I participate in experiences that I know will help me develop intellectually, ranging from an engineering camp to a research paper about the antimicrobial properties of different parts of apples. Yet, none of that provides me with the joy that I get when I am playing in a jazz combo in someone\\'s basement. The energy that flows between our ensemble as we modify tunes to our needs and learn to solo with one another is incomparable. The look that you get from another player when you know you\\'re swinging hard cannot be recreated elsewhere. Playing jazz allows me to express myself and interact with others in a way that I love.  \"}, {\"index\": 571, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] There\\'s a belief, originating from Greek mythology, that humans were created with four arms, four legs, and a head with two faces. Fearing their power, Zeus, the Greeks\\' god of the sky, split them in half, creating the humans we know today. By doing so, he condemned them to spend their lives searching for their other halves. This belief is an archaic explanation of one of our most basic emotions: love. My question is, however, when did Aphrodite take control of our own prosperity?Love has always been a focal point in many societies, even today when we spend more time looking at our phones than at each other. The term \\'true love\\' is an enigma. You can ask a hundred people how they would define love and you could have a plethora of varying answers. The truth of the matter is that this romanticized sense of love isn\\'t practical . There\\'s a huge emphasis on \\'infatuation\\' in our society as a whole, especially among teenagers, but why? It\\'s not like finding love is a life or death issue. All of this commotion about finding \\'the one\\' is mainly because it\\'s what the media accentuates. Think about it- when was the last time you saw a movie that didn\\'t involve at least some romance? Even Disney movies- films meant for little children- make love seem like a necessary part of life. The next time you go shopping at a convenience store, take a look at the magazines by the cash register; you might be surprised to find how many magazines are covered with models advertising \\'a better love life.\\' Everything we see on these unrealistic portrayals of \\'ordinary\\' women is changing what we believe is affection for someone and makes it so that the standards of beauty are no more than skin deep. This phenomenon takes the concepts of love and attraction and converges them. Through the influence of media, our thoughts have been altered so much that only someone with a supermodel figure is what is deemed \\'attractive;\\' therefore, the only person worth falling in love with. Wherever you go, everything is driven by the need to find a significant other; \\'Buy this mascara so you can win him over\\' or \\'Buy this cologne so you can make her fall for you.\\' Everything we buy is for one sole purpose: increasing our chances of finding a romantic companion. Of course all of this is beneficial to an extent, but we seem to have prioritized finding a suitable partner over improving ourselves. Especially during adolescence, time spent trying to win over someone you may not know in a few years is time better spent doing something to improve yourself. I\\'ve had my fair share of \\'romance\\' during my four years of high school and I, for one, can say that that time could have been spent working out to get a spot on the starting team or studying for a test without any distractions so that I could have gotten my average higher for that semester. At a sensitive time such as adolescence, it\\'s better to develop as a human and expand your horizons, cultivate yourself, your mind, your own curiosity and sense of wonder, rather than look for someone else to supply that satisfaction for you. The primary purpose of receiving a higher education is not only to ripen your curiosity, but also to become an individual who can share his or her own voice rather than be swept away with the masses.I\\'m in no position to say that love is the bane of our existence, nor is that the point of my argument. While it\\'s a driving emotion for humanity, whether love is beneficial or a distraction is based on how it\\'s practiced. Of course, my thoughts about this aren\\'t the most popular, but the way I see it, I\\'m the only person responsible for my own happiness. \"}, {\"index\": 572, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 573, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 574, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 575, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 576, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 577, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Being cut from the basketball team should not have come as a surprise to me. Someone with clumsy footwork and partial deafness does not exactly make the best teammate. In elementary school, I had never been a stellar athlete, a league behind or a team below everyone else. Despite loving the feeling of standing on the court and being watched, engaging the crowd, it just was not my place. Sitting at home one lonely winter afternoon while my friends were at practice, I downloaded an application that transported me from my bedroom into the rest of the world: Flipboard, an international news aggregator. I started reading about protests in Tunisia; it was almost like a movie, nothing similar to my peaceful suburban life. I was transfixed.\\'Yeah, I read that a street vendor set himself on fire.\\' It was the first time I had spoken about the news at the dinner table, where I was usually a passive listener. The movie-like action of a distant world was brought right into my kitchen, thanks to Flipboard.  When I traveled to Israel that spring, my Israeli family chatted about the Arab Spring, and again my mind was filled with vivid pictures of violence and unrest, the same thoughts I had every night at the dinner table some 5,000 miles away.  It dawned on me that the news did not just captivate people on Flipboard, at the dinner table, or even in Israel; it was everywhere, bringing billions around the world right into the thick of the action.  When I returned from Israel, I fully enveloped myself in the news, reading anything in newspapers, magazines, and websites.  At the same time, I heard about Model U.N.,  a club which simulated the U.N. in debates on various world issues. It was perfect: I would talk about information I already knew, with people my age!  Not long after difficult tryouts, I was up in front of a committee, speaking about transportation challenges in India. The words flowed out of me, the sentences forming naturally. Relaxed and confident, I went around the room, locking eyes with the other representatives. I loved the satisfaction I felt when people were attentive. I was in control, the audience in front of me hanging onto every word. It was as if I were right back on the basketball court, the same feelings rushing through my body. But not everyone feels the same way I do about public speaking.  As head of the club this year, I train novices to speak confidently and passionately. One brilliant writer, Ben, seemed to shrink away while speaking, causing everyone to ignore his innovative points. I worked with him early one morning, showing him how to stand straight and to use hand gestures to get his points across. Later that month, Ben\\'s whole body illuminated, suddenly communicating his points as effectively as his writing, just like we had practiced in the morning a mere two weeks earlier. He may not have noticed it, but the whole room could hear nothing but his ideas for the next few minutes. Although I was not speaking, seeing Ben express his true self in front of a crowd was just as gratifying as giving the speech myself. I could tell he had the same sense of pride I had after every moment at the front of a committee. While I loved basketball, passion was not enough for me to succeed.  Through Model U.N., I have been able to take a passion and develop it, fully immerse myself in world politics. Basketball taught me I needed that extra push to work towards what I loved, even if my efforts did not pan out on the court.  I may have felt clumsy on the hardwood floor, but I have found my footing in front of a crowd, speaking about what I love. \"}, {\"index\": 578, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Dusty piles of old toys and dried walnut shells stood between me and the lost evidence of my father\\'s personality. Like looking at a satellite image of ancient ruins, through the window I could discern the general shape of the art studio behind stacks of waste. 18 years had passed between my birth, his death, and the present moment when the desire to live alone had brought me to the front door of this mansard.Of course, my father\\'s presence was always tangible at my grandma\\'s home, where his artwork crowns the walls and a photograph of his wedding day stares from across the living room. But the memory of him that my grandma hung around herself, a neat arrangement of abstract paintings, is drained from vitality. Her memories have preserved only the innocence of the young boy. Standing at the door of the mansard, I was looking for traces left by a grown man with tremendous intellect and artistic drive. I was looking for guidance, more than just specific relics: general clues that would help me consider how I might end up framing the natural resemblance I have to this man.The primary reason for my visit to the mansard, however, was my intention to move there during the fall. In the seclusion of a new private space, I hoped to find self-sufficiency after years of dependence on my caregivers. I was to live alone, a rationalization underlined by the excitement of breaking away, and the allure of a more mature image of myself.My new life began as I searched the attic for clues of my father and for a stronger identity. I discovered dozens of pictures of him taken around Europe. The shelves on the wall were lined with luxurious art albums bought by my grandfather during his business trips. The atlas of the world from 1902 in French, the leather bound knife mounted on the wall, and the handcrafted fireplace spoke, still, in their bohemian voice, of the past. My father\\'s sense of aesthetics had helped him stage the studio of a painter and an adventurer who drank fearlessly from the cup of life. My grandparents financed him all the while.Moving into the attic, I was about to follow my father\\'s steps for the first time. Yet, his image emerged from the dust of the storage room different from what I hoped to discover. In place of the humanist exploring life through his art, I found a bohemian who centered his philosophy on hedonism. I saw little significance in the careful decoration of the studio. It was useful now to nobody. Moving in would serve nobody but my ego, too.I still had to find a home. My grandmother, 82 and living alone, is troubled by deteriorating health and by the boredom of life after the passing of most of her friends. She invited me to live with her, and I accepted. My company is a greater asset to the household than my skills, but grandma guides me patiently through the household chores. I often ask her to share parts of her life. In those excerpts, I sometimes catch glimpses of the timid boy; I hear the pain over the lost child. The giver of love suffers when the beloved is gone. Who soothes the pain from the loss of a child? I have that duty, the duty of love. This same duty called on my grandparents\\' decision to fund my father\\'s artistic pursuits. This same duty brings me back to my grandma, where I can be of help.I continue searching for my father. Not among the clutter of the storage room, but around myself, in the impact he had on the living. There I find his mistakes; there I see the recollection of his virtue. In the eyes of others, I see the unspoken lesson: always to live independently, but never alone. \"}, {\"index\": 579, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Sycamore, Illinois is a small town about 70 miles west of Chicago. It\\'s a place where corn is plentiful, people callcarbonated drinks \\'pop\\', and 25 cents gets you 12 hours of parking downtown. My parents immigrated to thispeaceful town to escape China\\'s Cultural Revolution and pursue their dreams of a higher education. Needless tosay, that dream didn\\'t include any large farm vehicles for \\'drive your tractor to school\\' day.I grew up in a school system that valued effort, farming, and football. I was raised in a home that valued accuracy,discipline, and education. My friends never understood why I couldn\\'t sleep over on weeknights, why I had topractice my violin, or why I never ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. My parents never understood why Iwanted to spend additional time with my friends after seeing them at school, why I wanted to watch my peers playhigh school sports, or why anyone would eat a nut and fruit together, on bread no less. Growing up with friendswho all had lighter skin than me, I was confused about why my hair and eyelashes didn\\'t curl like theirs.As I matured, it became more and more obvious that I was living in the midst of two opposite, but complementarycultures: one of the education driven, traditional Chinese family, and the other of an American rural town thatfocused more on farm labor than book work. In the end, this is the mix of cultures that made me who I am today.The sacrifices my parents made for me to be in the States and have an education are evident everyday throughtheir constantly tired eyes and calloused hands. I\\'ve learned from them and take my studies very seriously. Frommy peers I\\'ve learned that there are more ways to enrich my life than through just studying. I took time away fromthe books and applied myself outside my comfort zone to socialize and connect with my classmates. In return,they\\'ve elected me as class president for the past three years. Despite my strict educational upbringing, I havelearned that life is not all about the 7 am to 3 pm school day either. I make sure to keep my Friday nights open forfootball games, so I can support my friends every week and share not only their wins, but their losses as well. In acommunity where I don\\'t have the same colored skin, hair, or eyes as my peers, I still feel like family. And it is therelationship between this family and my biological family that resonates with me so strongly. Even when I travelacross the country to compete in tennis tournaments, with every strike of the ball, I feel the support of my parentswatching me court side just as much as the texts flooding into my phone from my community back home.As I move on to college, I could not be more proud of my heritage and community. My last name, which has beenwith my family for generations and has now traveled overseas, translates in English to \\'leaf\\'. And like theSycamore tree, which my town is named after, each person in the community is their very own leaf: cut, colored,and created differently. However, without the strong branches of support from family, friends, and the sports andmusic programs that have brought us all together, none of those leaves would develop to their full potential. Atfirst, I was tugged in many different directions, but as the seasons are changing and college is close, I know I am avery special leaf that will be blown away from this tree onto my own path.

Actinic prurigo is an autoimmune disease that results in painful, easily-infected skin lesions as a result of sun exposure. No cure exists for it, and current treatments are ineffective. Despite the fact that many people throughout the Americas suffer from this disease, little research is being done to cure it. Actinic prurigo is just one of many diseases ignored by the scientific community because they affect areas which don\\'t conduct a lot of their own research.As second and third world countries develop further, their citizens will begin to conduct more research that affects their specific populations. Niche diseases like actinic prurigo will get more attention, thereby improving the quality of life of the people who suffer from them. However, it is difficult for scientists in developing countries to get the respect and funding they deserve. This has been especially true in Russia. The Russian government actively prevented Russian scientists from exploring many promising avenues of research. In addition, scientists were forced to publish in a poorly organized database separate from pubmed (the main database of medical research papers in the Western world). Because of this, Russian research is in its own self-referential and hard to access bubble (according to an article in BioMed Central by Vasiliy Vlassov and Kirill Danishevskiy). Because this research was published in a different language and conducted differently, it is considered \\'unusable\\' for the scientific community as a whole. However, for all the West knows, it is wasting millions of dollars and years of time re-researching topics which the Soviets already explored.The scientific community should not waste money conducting research in developing regions if it will not be accessible to or respected by the majority of scientists. I believe the most important step in increasing access to new research is ensuring as many scientists as possible receive training in foreign languages. For example, I want to become fluent in Russian and translate some of the work the Russians produced in microbiology. I would also like to help translate research in the languages of Spanish, French, and Mandarin (which I study independently). Ultimately, I hope to found a nonprofit corporation dedicated to scientific translation to make it easier for scientists in under-funded monolingual areas to publish.However, a language barrier is not the only problem which budding scientists will face. The lack of standardized research procedures at the global level has resulted in unethical practices in many research institutions in countries like Russia and China. China leads the world in papers pulled due to plagiarism, and there is a troubling correlation between the articles published in Russian medical journals and the advertisements that run in the journals. These dubious practices cause research from these areas to be immediately rejected by many Western institutions (according to \\'Looks Good on Paper\\' from The Economist).Through my work at social services, I have met many intelligent people who lack the opportunity to explore their passions due to where they were born. I have also met many international students with a passion for the sciences who come to America so that their hard work will be recognized. These people deserve the chance to make a difference. I hope to join existing efforts to develop a U.N. committee specifically designed to monitor scientific research and help ethical scientists in corrupt countries conduct and publish research on issues that matter most to them. In this way, people from developing countries can become respected members of the scientific community. As the world economy becomes more global, science must follow suit. I hope to make sure the research done by these countries isn\\'t lost forever due to petty government oversights, lack of unbiased funding, or language barriers. \"}, {\"index\": 582, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] It is winter in East Germany, and food is scarce. The chilly wind nips at my nose and I am going to an election occurring between two Communist party candidates, who espouse the same ideas. Both disgust me for their complacency with the status quo and I would prefer to vote against both. Yet, the law compels me to vote and legitimate the system; I can\\'t abandon the party that forbids dissent.Debating the issue of compulsory voting, I am moved into another world. After reading articles from the Polish Sociological Review, I expound to my judges how in Eastern Europe and in Latin America, compulsory voting forces citizens to back oppressive regimes and closes avenues for dissent. Yet, because in competitive debate I have to defend both sides of an issue, I also argue the other side of the story. Using research I have devoured from the Quarterly Journal of Political Science, I ask judges to understand how compulsory voting can also be used to include more viewpoints and perspectives. I narrate the story of Australia where, because everyone has to vote, the government must make voting accessible. As a result, Australia has widely available voting on weekends and postal voting thereby allowing more people to participate in the political process. Understanding both sides of an issue, debate demands me to learn the tolerance for opposing ideas so necessary in a democratic society.Yet, debate doesn\\'t simply instill knowledge of current events; it also demands that I understand the consistency of certain values across radically different societies. Debating the legitimacy of the Electoral College, I articulate that the institution was created so that majorities would not violate the rights of political minorities in small states. Yet, the importance of protecting minority rights isn\\'t limited to the time of the Founding Fathers. Just as the Founding Fathers sought to protect the rights of political minorities through the Electoral College, so the Brazilian people have taken to the streets to defend minorities within their society. As I presently study presumed consent for organ donation, I\\'m transported to Brazil in the year of my birth. Standing amongst crowds in Rio de Janeiro, I see the Brazilian people appalled at legislation that allows the taking of organs from the illiterate who lack legal channels for dissent. Indeed, I learn to speak to values that echo across societies.However, sometimes, the doors I seek to open to foreign countries and time periods seem to be locked. Many scholarly articles are available solely on expensive databases such as Wiley and Jstor that I don\\'t normally have access to. Due to this roadblock, I will personally email professors for their articles and they\\'re usually willing enough to provide access to the requested materials. Thus, through debate, I\\'ve learned how to open doors for myself so that I can experience new and interesting literature.Furthermore, debate has not merely opened doors for me; it has also given me opportunities to open doors for others. Over the last four years, I have helped coach the local middle school debate team at a number of their tournaments. Last spring, I coached one team to win the NorCal Cup, meaning they were the best team in all of Northern California. Yet, this achievement has not been the greatest I\\'ve experienced during my work with these younger students. The most thrilling experience, instead, has been a common one. It\\'s when these students come to understand, with a knowing look across their faces, the inherent contestability of any assumption that I feel elation of the greatest magnitude. The experience is great.Thus, debate has taught to me open new worlds for myself and for others. Considering debate\\'s relevance in other subjects such as history, these great experiences will continue to aid me as I explore more worlds in the future. \"}, {\"index\": 583, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Donuts. My first foray into cooking and true independence. Simple enough, right? Wrong.I\\'m terrible in the kitchen. I grew up believing the ability to cook food evidenced not only a divinely ordained gift, but veritable wizardry. But as I grew older and more capable, started driving and learned to do laundry, the kitchen seemed more and more a personal failure. Sure, not everyone cooks, but it seems that everyone at least knows how. So I decided I would learn to make the one food that, for me, has always meant acceptance-an edible apology for being late or a shared snack between friends. Last spring when I came out to my mother in a terrified jumble of words, the donut was the I-love-you letter my mother left on my nightstand.Before donuts become perfect, melt-in-your-mouth, fluffy treats, they are an ugly mixture of eggs, flour, and foul- smelling yeast. The donut-to-be must be beaten, cajoled, coaxed, kneaded, fluffed, fried, and glazed into perfection over the course of three hours. I took nearly five. I spilled egg yolk across the kitchen, burned two donuts in the fryer, and nearly dropped an open sack of flour. Coaxing the unruly emerging dough from the bowl, I poked, prodded, and frowned at my handiwork. The house was empty. No advice, just a recipe, and my own knowledge to transform separate, unyielding ingredients into fragrant sweets all while marrying taste to texture and form to flavor. When my dough threatened to crack rather than suffer the injustice of being rolled, I patted water into the collapsing heap like I did clay in art class. I contemplated the chemical reactions between the yeast and sugar that would-as the recipe promised-make my dough double in size.Later, wrapped in the warm scent of rising dough, I pressed my grandmother\\'s donut cutter down onto the fluffy pastry. What was the point of the hole? I thought as I tried to tug the center of a donut away. The donut would be a far simpler creature without this trademark. The hole raises the probability its perfectly round shape is distorted while the dough is pulled away. The hole rebels against the glazing, leaking down onto the baking sheet. It would be far easier to make the donut without a hole. Was it just a mistake? And if so, why is it that donuts are adored, remembered with unfailing fondness? Didn\\'t people care that they got less food? I hovered anxiously over the fryer and watched the test batch of donuts brown in the hot oil. Buzzing between frying the bubbling donuts and mixing the glaze, I began to smile.There\\'s something so satisfying about making donuts. It\\'s a happy kind of stress where your mind is always occupied and ready for each new task with its own individual challenges. I had started and completed this process all on my own. Regardless of the taste of my finished product, I already felt like I\\'d won. I had egg yolk in my hair, flour all over me, and a messy kitchen, but I also had twenty homemade donuts and the satisfaction of mastering my first bit of wizardry.It was only after I ladled glaze onto the hot, fresh donuts that I understood. Life is messy and unexpected, riddled but also blessed with imperfections that, for me, make people and things more interesting, more distinct, and more loveable. I can love the struggle and the failure that goes into the pursuit of perfection because it reminds me that if we can be challenged, we can also change. Maybe the hole started out as a mistake, an unforeseen byproduct in a baker\\'s quest for the perfect pastry, but instead became a cherished failure. After all, if I can learn to make donuts, anything is possible. \"}, {\"index\": 584, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 585, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The clock struck four, and I was lost in the city of Zaragoza. I meant to take the five-minute walk from my Spanish exchange summer school to my host family\\'s apartment on Calle Don Jaime. Distracted by street musicians and fascinated by chance encounters with structures that were already ancient when the first Europeans came to the shores of America, I had taken a few wrong turns and wandered into an unfamiliar barrio. I soon found myself in a crowded plaza, mesmerized by my first close-up sight of the basilica. Overlooking the Ebro River like a fearsome fortress, it dominates the city with its soaring walls flanked by perfectly symmetrical golden turrets. Incorporating elements of Christian and Islamic iconography, the basilica reflects the complex blending of cultures that makes Spain so uniquely fascinating.I had come to Zaragoza to master the Spanish language and immerse myself in the multicultural heritage of the city, so I spent every possible moment engaging the local people in conversations about their culture, politics, and society. At that moment, I wished those conversations had more to do with local geography, since I had no clue how to return to my host family\\'s apartment.Lost was not an unfamiliar or uncomfortable feeling. I find that the sensation of being lost is usually a prelude to some discovery. A few years earlier, I felt intellectually lost when I tried to teach myself how to write computer code for a Blackjack game. I quickly discovered that programming the game was much more complex than the tutorial videos had suggested. Staring at my glowing computing screen while trying to figure out how to translate my intentions for the game into the esoteric language of computer code was like knowing what to say but not knowing how to speak. After a few days of frustration, I realized that I could approach computer science in the same way I approached learning Spanish, and later Arabic and Italian. I would first decipher the basic syntax of the new language and then fill in the blanks with new vocabulary. This approach worked, and since then I have thought of all new programming languages as merely different dialects that could be used to communicate with the electrical signals inside computers. Applying my passion and talent for understanding foreign languages to computer languages enabled me to progress from being intellectually lost to finding my way to a level of sophisticated understanding of the computer. In the future, I would use this understanding to write coding projects in my math class, my Leadership executive team, my internship, and my spare time.This memory of figuring out how to grapple with the language of computer programming gave me an idea about how to find my way home. I decided to think like a programmer, transforming my challenge into a series of rational statements while gathering information that could be manipulated to find a solution. I assembled useful inputs from helpful strangers in the plaza and soon discovered the route back to my apartment. There is nothing quite like the feeling of being lost in a problem to motivate the search for new ideas to solve that problem. I can\\'t wait to get lost in my next challenge. \"}, {\"index\": 586, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Transition from Childhood to Adulthood (Common App):Key themes: leadership, embarrassment, self-reflection, continual learningAfter seventeen years of life, including twelve years of school, the only thing I know is that that I know nothing. My life has become a Socratic Paradox.Last year I became the co-coordinator of my school\\'s Leadership Education and Development (LEAD), an innovative program aiming to inspire students to harness their passions and evoke positive social change. As the co-coordinator, I dreamed of bringing the LEAD program overseas with the overarching goal of expansion. Not only would it be a test of our curriculum, but also it would spread the power of one beyond the walls of the Illinois Math and Science Academy. Because of this, I organized a week-long leadership workshop at a school in Hyderabad, India, and I was confident that my experience as the LEAD co-coordinator had primed me for success. Much to my dismay, this was an erroneous assumption.I met my first set of obstacles outside the workshop classroom. Every evening after workshop, I returned to my host family\\'s flat and meandered into the kitchen where beautiful plates of vegetables rested on the table. One particular afternoon, as I was contently eating the dish, I caught the incriminating gaze of my host-sister. \\'Did you just eat the pappu?\\' she asked in disbelief. Cheeks full, I nodded in oblivious satisfaction. \\'Those were for the gods,\\' she remarked.I stopped mid-chew and stared at the ground, heart sinking upon the realization that I just consumed my host family\\'s religious offering. I tried to apologize, but before I could utter a single word, she muttered, \\'very American.\\' Though I made a point of assimilating into Indian culture, I had never been so aware of my foreignness. I learned phrases in basic Telugu, ate from the pani puri street stalls, enjoyed the thrill of the threewheeled autos, and visited temple with my host family. But, despite my efforts, I was stared at by pedestrians, questioned by strangers, and photographed by students. Prior to my trip to India, I viewed myself as a globallyaware citizen; I assumed that my position as the co-coordinator of a leadership program was a license in cultural competence. Unfortunately, I quickly realized that being \\'American\\' was the only thing I knew and the only thing for which I was known.My trials in Hyderabad simultaneously extended into the workshop classroom. Whether discussing the Great Man Theory, groupthink, or various ethical systems, students in Hyderabad took nothing as dogma. In one discussion, they introduced a new system of ethics that my curriculum had not previously considered. In another discussion, they rejected LEAD\\'s philosophy that leadership could be taught, claiming that leadership stems from intrinsic and divine characteristics. Seeing that the students and I lacked a common starting point, I tailored activities to reflect our differing backgrounds. Much to my success, upon combining our perspectives through discussion, students became more engaged, expressive, and receptive in the classroom. In the end, I learned more about myself from the differences between us, as the assumptions I made and the notions I held true were far from universal. It became clear that knowledge of a culture does not simply come through reading. It comes through engaging.Though I went to Hyderabad to be a teacher, I left having been the student. I learned how to bridge cultural differences, find common grounds, and use my own inadvertent missteps as a springboard for learning more. In college, it is neither my skills nor my intelligence that will guarantee success. Rather, it is my childlike impulse to question everything I know about myself and the world around me. Adopting such a state of mind\\\\u2014the state of being a perpetual student\\\\u2014has marked my transition from childhood to adulthood. This, I believe, is my true raison d\\'\\\\u00eatre. \"}, {\"index\": 587, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Some children are afraid of monsters under their beds. I wasn\\'t one of those children.Instead, Osama Bin Laden hid in my hamper and Hitler crouched in the back of my closet. I\\'d stay up late into the night concocting elaborate escape plans for any and all situations: house fires, home invasions, confrontations with costumed characters at Disneyland (who were obviously potential kidnappers attempting to trick less vigilant children). I was scared of many, many things, but more than anything else, I was absolutely terrified of making mistakes.My parents weren\\'t aware of my perfectionist tendencies when they started me in ballet, but by the time I was six, it was apparent the activity was a perfect fit. At nine, I started daily training with a former Soviet-era ballerina who shared my outlook on mistakes. I auditioned into the Advanced Studies program at the Colburn School of Performing Arts at 14, and while my classes have grown progressively harder, one thing has remained constant. Ballet demands perfection.But it also demands fearlessness. Having the technique required to execute the difficult fouett\\\\u00e9 combination in the finale of Balanchine\\'s \\'Western Symphony\\' is one thing. Launching into it knowing you might land in the orchestra pit is the real trick.I learned how to be fearless the summer before high school, and it didn\\'t just change the way I dance. It changed the way I live. There I was, perched atop of a 40-foot ladder on a high ropes course as part of a bonding activity at LEAD\\'s Computer Science Institute. Two days earlier, I would have climbed down. But I had just flown by myself across the country to the University of Virginia to study a subject about which I knew absolutely nothing. Of course I jumped off that ladder \\\\u2013 it felt like I already had.And later that summer, when a Startalk scholarship took me to Hawaii to learn Mandarin, I jumped again. Back when I started French immersion school in kindergarten, I was so afraid of making a mistake I didn\\'t utter a word for six months, but at Chinese camp I spoke Mandarin on the first day. And so what if I told my professor I was \\'too fat\\' to go the Batman movie? Or if two years later, when I got a scholarship to study in Hunan Province among real Chinese people, my mind went blank at McDonald\\'s and all I could remember how to ask for was orange juice?Being fearless has even shaped how I compete in national circuit Lincoln-Douglas debate. My coach warned me that running a feminist and anti-colonialist critique of linear time (a completely original position) in the sudden death rounds of the Alta Silver & Black Invitational was a huge risk, but I put fear aside and won three rounds in a row, becoming the first debater from my school ever to win a bid to the Tournament of Champions as a junior.I can\\'t say I don\\'t aspire to perfection anymore. I do. But I can honestly say that I\\'m no longer afraid of making mistakes. Just as the ideal path to safety when escaping the kidnapper who slips in through your bedroom window at 4 a.m. is not a straight line, neither is the path to perfection. It\\'s a circuitous route paved in equal parts with triumphant victories and mortifying mistakes.Last summer, when I spent a few weeks in New York taking professional-level ballet classes, I couldn\\'t help but be intimidated. Some of my classmates were members of ABT\\'s corps de ballet, my teachers were ballet legends, and I was the youngest person in the room. Each day, I had to make a choice. I could do fewer pirouette turns and make sure my landing was clean, or do more, and potentially fall out of the position. A double pirouette is safe.

Today was the third annual City of Houston Open Innovation Day Hackathon. I sat down, pulled out my dinosaur of a laptop and was greeted by one of my Desktop Images: a SQL statement which said \\'SELECT * FROM world WHERE people LIKE% \\'$you\\'\\'; >No Results Found... (Select everyone from world where a person is like you... No results were found). Encouraged, I began to program and build my website.This hackathon was different from the others. It encouraged the tech savvy and concerned citizens alike to develop technology to improve Houston. Everyone had a solution for an issue in the city. Some wanted to make restaurant food policy violation maps; others, campaign finance data visualization. Like everyone else, I knew why I was here. I was here to increase exposure to issues in our city that would otherwise go unaddressed.  I knew firsthand that there was a need for my product. After my mother\\'s divorce, she was diagnosed with cancer and was unable to work, making it impossible for her to purchase a home for our family. It turns out, homeownership, especially for people in my community, is extremely complicated. Even though it exists, about 70% of people in the US don\\'t know about financial assistance. I knew how these programs could change lives. Without them, my mom would not have been able to purchase the home we live in today. Recognizing the barriers others like my family face, it became my mission to make people more aware of financial assistance.I knew there were many ways to make a difference, but programming has become my art form and activism; two passions that seemed to have been passed down from generation to generation. My family has historically been extremely artistic.  My dad painted a mural at Avondale to increase autism awareness. My grandmother used her ability to paint to create art pieces for many of the Kwanzaa ceremonies around Houston. Similar to my family, I adopted Computer Science as my creative outlet and change agent. With a keyboard in place of a paint brush and sublime text editor in place of a canvas, programming has always been my form of personal expression. There is beauty and elegance when code is written in an efficient and organized manner. The style of object oriented programming is similar to Romantic era art: very complex, but beautiful. Not only that, but Computer Science can be used to solve many of the world\\'s problems. I taught myself how to program in hopes that I can make a positive impact on the world. After many small projects, I heard about the City of Houston Hackathon, a 24-hour event where programmers develop technology to benefit the city of Houston. This was the opportunity to show off my newly acquired self-taught skill to people who would appreciate my \\'techno-art\\'.After the grueling 24 hours of programming, I summoned the courage to present my solution to the 300 other concerned citizens and local governing officials. After my presentation, I received congratulations from people at the event and some even expressed how they will use my site to help them purchase a home. This invigorated my spirit and with a renewed passion, I spent the summer developing the website further and gathering input from local housing organizations on how to improve my site and learn more of the caveats in homeownership. Now, I plan to expand the services provided by my website to other cities in the state of Texas and potentially the entire United States. Sooner or later, this hackathon project will become a service that helps people across the entire country achieve their goal of homeownership. \"}, {\"index\": 590, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] We are interested in learning more about you and the context in which you have grown up, formed your aspirations, and accomplished your academic successes. Please describe the factors and challenges that have most shaped your personal life and aspirations. How have these factors helped you to grow? (Word limit: 800)     My humble town of Modesto is rather famous, but not for particularly good reasons. High rates of drug use, theft, and other crimes are our claim to fame. There are parts of town that meet this stereotype, but other parts are quite nice. I live in between the two.     I\\'m no stranger to drug abuse. Throughout the years, several of my neighbors have had various addictions. Due to his mother\\'s habitual drug abuse during pregnancy, one of my childhood friends from across the street was born with a mental defect; at the time, I was too young to understand this. The neighbors who replaced them several years ago had constant issues with domestic violence. It\\'s easy to shrug off stories about the harms of drugs and violence, but seeing it occur over and over again has engraved a fear of committing such abuse into my very being. Yet, hearing police sirens and the occasional gunshot no longer instills a reaction in me. They have become too commonplace.     I live in the eye of a storm. Over the course of my entire life, burglaries have happened up and down my street, but I\\'ve been fortunate enough to have been burglarized only once. As a child, it\\'s terrifying to know a stranger has destroyed your home, broken your toys, torn up your bed, and strewn your belongings into an unrecognizable mess. When living in that constant fear, I found the best way to cope with such fear was to be rid of it altogether. It hurt to see what the robbers had done to my home, but it hurt infinitely more to see the devastation on my mother\\'s face after the incident. Through the crime I\\'ve seen around me, I\\'ve developed an insensitivity to the idea that harm might befall myself but a fear of seeing it impact my loved ones.      Though my home was a haven from the outside world, it still lacked security. In fifth grade, as we celebrated my brother being the first in our family to go to college and my parents devised a plan to pay for his education, my father was fired. Three fourths of our income disappeared overnight because he was framed for embezzlement. We burned through my parents\\' savings in a matter of months, becoming buried in debt as we struggled to make ends meet and still secure my brother\\'s education. The former wasn\\'t always possible. There were times when they cut off our water, our electricity, and, nearly, our house. At the age of ten, I learned the value of money. I stopped wanting to become rich like my parents wanted. I just wanted to feel secure and never worry about money again.     Fortunately, my father was offered a job fixing computers with a starting salary almost twice what he made before. However, our relief was short lived. Though he was deemed capable of the job, he was denied the opportunity simply because he didn\\'t have a college degree. I remember that phone call every time I think of college. At that time, my father felt like he had failed all of us, as though our problems were his burden alone. I can\\'t imagine how hard that was for him and I won\\'t find out because he has given me the opportunity to do better for myself.     For the most part, school provided an escape from my problems at home. My school has a strong population of students from well-off families in wealthy neighborhoods. That\\'s the reason I transferred to Enochs in the first place, for better opportunities and a better community. I thought going to a nice school would help me escape everything I dislike about my neighborhood. I was right, but I forgot that it meant I would be from a different world than everyone else. For most of my friends, break-ins were nothing more than stories on the news. Money wasn\\'t an issue. They would invite me to go to the movies, as though spending $20 in one day was no big deal. As a result, I often stood out, being unable to do all the things they would want to do, astounded by their freedom to roam the town on their own.      I\\'m glad to have seen two different forms of life. The lavish lives of my schoolmates made me realize how much in life is unnecessary. Their ignorance to the problems of others not as well off as them made me realize that there is so much more to the world than I know. Just like they fail to understand my circumstances from theirs, I, too, may be unaware of the problems of those not as well off as myself. I don\\'t want material in life, I want substance, understanding, and my loved ones. \"}, {\"index\": 591, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] My feet strike the ground with the familiar sound of a metronome keeping time. My chest expands and contracts as I breathe in the cool morning air. I smell the comforting scent of pines as the green trees rush by the path, reminding me of my favorite camping trips deep in the heart of a forest. While running, the human body functions like a machine, a complex network of levers and pulleys. The fact that I live in a machine that can climb mountains, make beautiful music, and run marathons amazes me. There is a beauty in pushing my physical abilities to their limits, and it is this very unique beauty that motivates me to run marathons. I understand, however, that no matter how much I train, no matter how well I think I am prepared, running a marathon will never be easy. Rarely in my life have I so wanted to lie on the ground, curl into a ball, and quit as much as I wanted to after reaching mile twenty of my first marathon. Some people may not understand why I put myself through this, why I would go through so much strain for little tangible reward. Though the work required is daunting, the inspiration I have derived from my mom has helped me overcome obstacles I previously believed to be insurmountable. Three years ago, my mom decided to earn an Associate\\'s degree while working from home. A year into earning her degree, she was diagnosed with brain cancer. This new obstacle meant she would have to endure surgery, having a portion of the affected brain tissue removed. Shortly after the surgery, many sensory functions of her brain were impaired. The presence of multiple sources of audio and visual input became too overwhelming to bear, and speech functions occasionally disappeared altogether. After time, these basic abilities were restored through hard work and many moments of difficulty. Even with the unfortunate circumstances, my mother continued to work while pursuing her degree, despite moving at a much slower pace. After making steady progress through her coursework, she completed her degree in the spring of 2015, successfully finishing something many would have considered unachievable.  Being with my mother as she strained to study her materials, her brain actively relearning how to store and access information, including basic vocabulary and reactions to sensory inputs, made the many hardships she was facing apparent. In many ways, her brain was being forced to run a marathon on a daily basis. Humanity\\'s ability to overcome hardships, a body running over twenty miles, or a brain functioning, learning, and developing after having a portion removed, is more amazing to me than nearly anything else I have witnessed in this world. Because of these experiences, I realized that this beauty is very deliberately achieved through hard work, and is more striking than anything produced through passivity. Even though the completion of my marathon is, thus far, the most difficult achievement I have attained, I will not be deterred from finishing many more in my future. From an outside perspective, it is difficult to grasp why anyone would choose to run a marathon, the same way it is hard to understand why I would stay up late writing code I would never be tested on, spend my summer days studying advanced mathematics, or hope to pursue a life of studying and learning as an engineer. The key to understanding lies in the beauty of the human body achieving astounding things. Engineers developing artificial organs, physicists studying the makeup of subatomic particles, and astronauts landing on the moon all amaze me beyond words, and it is because of this that I want to study mechanical engineering. I understand, through experience, that such astounding achievements come through struggle rather than passive behavior. It is this understanding that allows me to persevere towards the finish line, for my mother\\'s example has proven to me that the impossible does not always have to remain unattainable. \"}, {\"index\": 592, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The best part of asking Rachel to homecoming was her expression of pure ecstasy.Foothill High, a phone application I personally designed, supplied her with two choices \\\\u2013 \\'screw you\\' and \\'I do.\\'When she touched \\'I do,\\' the app notified me immediately.The app was not always running this smooth though. Two years ago, it did not exist. I had to design, implement,test, and now, maintain every single part of it \\\\u2013 from displaying grades to sports to today\\'s schedule and more.Naturally, more than a few unforeseen consequences have arisen since the app\\'s inception. Squashing bugs,providing support and updating the app with new information as the school year progresses require time and effortthat takes away from my regular schoolwork. So why did I build the app in the first place, and why do I bothermaintaining it now, given its high upkeep commitment?My reasoning for maintaining and creating the app are intertwined. After taking a series of courses in computerscience at my school, UCI, and Stanford, I eagerly applied this newfound knowledge to the world around me. Atthe beginning of my junior year, I could not access the new bell schedule on my school\\'s official website. I realizedmy background in computer science would allow me to create a better solution. A month and a half and hundredsof hours later, I launched the Foothill High School app.The school community regularly uses the app, with more than 1,500 installations and 500 unique visitors everyday attesting to its unequivocal role in the school experience. Once, when a bug in the app resulted in its failure toremind people of a change in the schedule, a significant number of students arrived late to class. With a firmsense of responsibility for errors like these as the app\\'s creator, I faced a dilemma entering senior year.Although the app\\'s importance rose to patent heights, its future remained decidedly uncertain. My stable andongoing role as developer of the app would be in serious jeopardy upon my graduation, yet the livelihood of theapp completely depended on its one man support team \\\\u2013 me. Ultimately, I narrowed my decision regarding theapp\\'s fate to three options.First, I could shut the app down, but it would be unfair to my peers who rely on it. Secondly, I could continue tomaintain the app after I graduated, but the required long term commitment will be unreasonable since I gain nomonetary income from the app. I believe that the advantages of a quality free app benefit the community morethan the profit would motivate me.The third and most viable option was to entrust a younger student with developing the app. So, since thebeginning of my senior year, I have been teaching an enthusiastic young student, Sara, about the Foothill Highapp. With a direct connection to the society that the app serves, Sara should successfully improve upon thehundreds of hours already invested in the app, establishing a natural succession of young leaders and developers,perpetually benefiting my school and my community. These innovators\\' ongoing maintenance, updates andimprovements will benefit their scholastic experience just as the app benefited mine. While mentoring has and willcontinue to require many hours of training and patience, I believe the end goal \\\\u2013 a fluid and updated app for yearsto come \\\\u2013 requires my commitment.I started working on the Foothill High app as a product of my own curiosity, but it has grown organically into apivotal aspect of the student experience at Foothill High School. Creating the app was an intellectually rewardingexperience, but working to ensure its existence beyond my graduation is perhaps more gratifying. And Homecoming turned out to be an awesome night too. \"}, {\"index\": 593, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] In recent years a dear family friend suffered from a herniated disk and required immediate surgery to try to repair the damage. However, her operation did not go as planned and she was told that she may never walk again. Every day since then, I have witnessed her inability to perform simple tasks. Her new disability has not only affected her life, but the lives of her entire family and all of her friends. I have always viewed her as a strong individual and have tremendous respect for her. Through her perseverance and determination she was able to walk again, but with a severe limp due to her lack of feeling in her left leg. I cannot begin to comprehend and understand the struggles that she must face every day, and thus I am passionate about helping individuals in similar circumstances.My hope is to combine my interests in mechanical engineering and helping people through the development and improvement of prosthetics. Through advancements in technology and improved design, functionality and comfort can be improved. Additive manufactured prosthetics could increase the functionality through intricate internal mechanisms, allowing the prosthetic to be designed to function more like the original limb. The increased function would limit the acclimation period, and ease the transition process thus allowing the wearer to return to normal life more quickly. Currently, occupational therapy ranges from two to six months, merely for the individual to learn how to use their new artificial limb. As prosthetics become more similar to their original counterparts, the therapy time will be dramatically reduced.Functionality, comfort, and durability can be improved through the development and utilization of new materials, such as artificial membranes. They would increase durability, reduce chaffing, and make the faux limb look more lifelike; by simulating the texture and appearance of skin, the prosthetic will become less noticeable by people and allow the wearer to live a more normal life. In high wear areas, friction must be reduced to make the prosthetic more durable. Different materials can lubricate these areas to reduce chaffing and discomfort, but also increase the effectiveness and ease of use.Working with the Wounded Warrior Project will allow me to work with injured veterans and will help me understand their daily struggles, thus allowing me to identify critical needs and current design constraints. Although specialized prosthetics work well for a single purpose, they fail to meet the needs of day-to-day life, and are expensive and impractical. On the other hand, generalized prosthetics can perform more tasks, but do not have the control that is sometimes necessary. Robotic limbs incorporate benefits from both types, and can perform a wide range of functions, with a high level of control. The only drawback is that Robotic prosthetics are expensive, but as technology advances they will become more affordable. With current technology the concept of synthetic nerves do not appear to be in the near future; their development will revolutionize the industry, allowing prosthetics to be more lifelike, and extremely functional. These artificial nerves will also eliminate Phantom pain and sensations-caused by overactive severed nerves- for which there currently is no treatment. The artificial nerves will consist of sensors that react to external stimuli in the environment, send electrical impulses to the brain allowing the user to \\'feel\\' with their prosthetic. Actuators within the artificial limb will act as receptors for electrical outputs from the brain allowing the user to control the prosthesis like its original counterpart.To improve upon the current designs, I will need learn manufacturing techniques, properties of different materials, functions of the body, mechanics, and also conduct essential research on artificial membranes, robotic components, and additive manufacturing technologies. Hopefully with these skills that I develop through my undergraduate and graduate studies, I will be able to help those who cannot help themselves and give them their independence back. \"}, {\"index\": 594, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] **names redacted**I am my brother\\'s keeper. Over five years ago, my brother XYZ had leukemia. When his prognosis worsened, he needed a bone marrow transplant to have a chance at surviving. I was his perfect match, and on a December afternoon, my marrow infused into his bloodstream. My blood became his blood, and from that point we shared a permanent, undeniable genetic link. A few months later, XYZ was declared cancer-free. It was a picture-perfect ending to a picture-perfect story. But after cancer lost the fight for my brother\\'s life, it moved on to a new target: my identity. Almost one year post- transplant, a reporter from a local news station visited my home, filming a game of Risk my family was playing that night. When it was my turn to be interviewed, I told the reporter about all the difficulties of the past year\\\\u2014not seeing my family for weeks at a time, struggling to create solidarity among other siblings of cancer patients, and the ever-present fear of losing my brother. When the segment aired a week later, my story was reduced to just fifteen seconds. The camera showed XYZ challenging me for the last country I held on the Risk board, identifying me on screen as \\'Brother.\\' Then XYZ rolled three sixes\\\\u2014a perfect roll\\\\u2014and my final piece was wiped off the board. In those fifteen seconds, I had been relegated to just one word: brother. Everything I had done and everything I had felt had been masked by the idea that I was his keeper, that my only purpose was to be the one to protect him. Eventually, seasons passed. Cancer lost its post-mortem grip on my being, and I carved out an identity for myself beyond that one word. But in April, XYZ relapsed. The doctors told me I couldn\\'t give him my marrow a second time, and I would lose that special genetic bond to a stranger. Only one thought ran through my head. Am I still my brother\\'s keeper? When my parents reached out to a local news channel for help in finding a new donor, I refused to be on air. I stood behind the cameraperson, out of the shot, unwilling to share another fifteen-second sound bite recalling the story of XYZ\\'s cancer and marrow transplant. After the interview, my mother began questioning why I wouldn\\'t do everything possible to help him again. As much as I wanted to love and support XYZ in every way possible, I wasn\\'t ready to just be \\'brother\\' again. I didn\\'t want every part of me to be relegated to being his keeper. So I did what I thought was necessary to preserve my selfhood: I pushed his cancer away, I avoided the hospital and my marrow advocacy work, and I tried to focus on anything else\\\\u2014anything to mask the reality that my brother was, once again, a leukemia patient. The mask could never truly conceal the pain behind it. I was so scared of just being \\'XYZ\\'s brother,\\' so scared that acknowledging this one, unexpected chapter of my life would overshadow the rest of my story. By running away from the relapse, I had let it do the very thing I was trying to avoid\\\\u2014I had let it define my life, and I had let it dictate my story. But XYZ\\'s cancer couldn\\'t define me. Just because I was, once again, the brother of a leukemia patient didn\\'t mean that was all I was. Though we no longer shared the same cells, the onus was still on me to be the brother\\\\u2014to love him, support him, and help those just like him. But as much as I was brother, I was still a writer, a political activist, a cancer advocate, a debater, a black belt, a blogger, and the many other identities I was continuing to create. I am my brother\\'s keeper, but I am also one other thing: JCstanford20.  \"}, {\"index\": 595, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 596, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  Don\\'t make your kids switch schools in the middle of high school. It\\'s too traumatic.  \\\\u2014Possible proverb. When I started high school at Worthington Kilbourne, I was an excited slightly-nerdy freshman. I played tennis, joined the Science Olympiad and Mock Trial teams, and did homework. I spent my weekends watching TV and sleeping. But I also had a ton of friends. Tennis friends, lunch friends, club friends, class friends\\\\u2026I had more friends as a freshman than I had people in my grade at middle school. And I was happy. My classes were pretty easy, I was able to take drawing classes, I was in extracurriculars I loved and I had yet to encounter the notorious \\'girl drama\\'. Everything felt perfect\\\\u2026and that\\'s the moment I decided to change high schools. It probably doesn\\'t make sense that I would transfer schools, especially if everything was perfect. I was first introduced to Columbus Academy (CA) by my friend Alex, when he told me he was transferring. We probably would\\'ve parted ways there, but the thing about Columbus Academy (CA) was that it had really good academics. Not only did the administration encourage kids to take challenging classes, but the material in each class I toured was interesting and relevant. The teachers were all extremely engaging, and that also meant a lot to me. I might have loved the life I already had, but I\\'m an academic at heart and the lure of all of the knowledge\\\\u2014the things I could learn, the opportunities I could gain in order to learn more beyond high school\\\\u2026it drew me in. Losing the friends I already had, the clubs I loved, the ten hours of sleep a night I was getting was all worth it, if it meant I got the opportunity to learn more about the world and to take interesting and challenging classes with amazing teachers. So I decided to go with him\\\\u2026and I thrived. If going to high school was like upgrading to a color TV from a black and white one, going to CA was like getting the newest 60\\' HD TV. Everything was sharper and more intense, mostly in a good way. My classes were more challenging and more interesting, and I was excited about what I was learning. I made friends and joined new clubs, and even participated in the tennis team although I wasn\\'t allowed to compete. With the change though, also came some bad things as well. My classes were a lot harder than I was used to, and I didn\\'t get easy As. I had to do everything I could to stay on top of my work, as well as extracurriculars. I had participated in several research competitions before I transferred, but it was much harder once I was at CA because there was no existing infrastructure to help me enter and pace myself. Over time though, I learned better time management skills and how to balance my activities, so I wasn\\'t overwhelmed and could concentrated on the reason I switched\\\\u2014the learning. I also decided to establish a science fair advisory club at CA, to help students with similar interests get started. While there are definitely times I look back and think about how different my life would be if I hadn\\'t transferred, I also think about the things I would have lost. Not only has my love of learning thrived at CA, but the experiences I\\'ve had here have also given me tools that I believe will help me succeed in life. I\\'m more confident in my abilities to face challenges and lead others, and I\\'ve learned a lot of academic skills as well as life ones. So even though I do sometimes wonder what life would be like if I had stayed at Kilbourne, I have never regretted my decision. I would make it again in a heartbeat.  \"}, {\"index\": 597, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] If you tremble at the prospect of public speaking, you probably will have been told to picture the audience in their underwear. My advice? Imagine they are loofahs.Showers possess a seemingly magical ability to make any user feel like Beyonc\\\\u00e9 reincarnated, and, as a result, belting out favorite tunes in the shower is a truly time-honored pastime. This certainly applies to me: the plop-plopping of the water emboldens me to let my vocal cords tingle with freedom. However, I now capitalize on the power of the shower in a different way: I practice delivering speeches. The shampoo, soap and loofah can be members of an unwaveringly supportive audience for aspiring rappers and overly enthusiastic debaters alike.When I first started debating, my meager fifteen minutes of preparation time was squandered panicking, and when the time came to stutter through my speech, I was anxiety-ridden with how unprepared I was. The losses unsurprisingly piled up. I was reassured that debating just wasn\\'t the right activity for everybody. Yet I loved how I would come out of debates, defeat after defeat, with a more nuanced understanding of the world: aware of the informal barriers facing women in the workplace, and aware of the short-comings of the free market in dealing with collective action problems. I was determined to improve. On top of allocating time each night to track down insightful articles and watch videos of champion debaters, I began practicing in the shower.As I sudsed up my hair, I explained the advantages of introducing extensive squatters\\' rights, and analyzed the consequences of criminalizing climate change denial. Facing bubbles rather than unimpressed faces, I was composed and collected, able to articulate my ideas coherently. Inevitably, I\\'d stumble on certain lines of analysis, so I\\'d try again. And again. And again. The shampoo and conditioner patiently endured countless attempts to explain the importance of protecting parental rights.As a result, I am now able to utilize my fifteen minutes far more effectively. I spend the time finding hidden assumptions in my arguments and preempting attacks, rather than trying to write out my speech verbatim. There\\'s no need: in the shower I manage with only water droplets as cue cards.To this day, the shower is a key part of my involvement in debating. It is a wonderful test-chamber for me to experiment. I can try out different introductions, knowing that I will be the only one cringing at the cheesier ones. I can perfect my \\'outraged voice\\' without the judgement that comes with awkward-sounding efforts. And during important speeches, I imagine I\\'m speaking in front of an audience of colorful loofahs. The thought of the shower is so empowering.You might think I\\'m ridiculous. You might be laughing at me, judging me for being far too obsessed with debating. But however embarrassing this story may be, debating has already provided me with so much fulfillment and undoubtedly will continue to do so when I go to university. This slightly odd habit of mine has most certainly been worth it, and I am so ready to find more \\'creative\\' ways to overcome the challenges that life will inevitably bring. Perhaps I will familiarize myself with new computer programming languages by speaking in source code in the shower \\\\u2013 who knows, having to say \\'open curly brace\\' and \\'close curly brace\\' every thirty seconds might quickly become very tedious, but I\\'m willing to try. \"}, {\"index\": 598, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 599, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] It was Tuesday, July 12th, 2011; my mom announced that she would divorce my dad. I couldn\\'t believe it! I was thirteen at the time and the idea of \\'divorce\\' seemed unreal. Who would have thought that the two parents who dearly loved me, an only child, would separate? And the irony in this is that I am adopted.Initially, the divorce had an overwhelming impact on my life, leading me to wonder, \\'Why, why would my parents divorce while I\\'m still so young?\\' Both tried comforting me, telling me, \\'I love you. You will be happy it happened,\\' but I doubted it. Every day I came from school to my \\'home,\\' but it was incomplete, always missing someone. I looked forward to weekends with my mom, but, when I was with her, I missed my dad. As time passed I realized that the situation was permanent, so I diverted my energy to my academics and hobbies, and started spending a good deal of time tutoring at my elementary school.One day, I noticed my nine year old student Alan couldn\\'t solve a trivial multiplication problem. I heard him say, \\'I give up. I can\\'t do this.\\' When I asked \\'Why?\\' he explained his parents\\' were divorcing and that was deeply affecting him.Feeling a sense of deja vu, I related with Alan and said, \\'I went through the same exact situation!\\'Perking up, Alan asked \\'How did you deal with it?\\'I tried to find words to explain in a straightforward way. \\'My parents would argue over every single issue, always butting heads. I honestly just remembered their reassuring words \\'I love you.\\' You will be happy it happens!.\\'Focusing on my words, Alan replied, \\'Same. My parents tell me exactly the same thing! It just doesn\\'t seem encouraging or helpful at all.\\'I continued, \\'Well, over the next few years, I stopped obsessing over the situation and the differences between me and the other kids at school, and did not allow fate to lead me.\\'Hesitant and slightly confused, Alan questioned, \\'Fate?\\'In a more serious tone, I elaborated, \\'I kept my hopes high and made a determined effort to take charge and focus on the future to better my life, rather than dwell on the past.\\'Alan sentimentally replied, \\'For some reason, I just don\\'t think I can do that. It really disappoints me that my parents had to separate for them to be happy.\\'Reassuringly, I told Alan \\'Don\\'t worry. It was really difficult for me to move on too. Trust me, it will improve.\\'Alan thanked me, \\'Kunal, you really helped me feel better. I don\\'t feel as alone and different anymore. You are living proof that a kid can still come out alright from a divorce.\\'Before Alan left, I wanted him to know the rest of my story, and so told him \\'I eventually came to realize that I could and should, control, influence, and direct my own destiny, and that I can make my life what I want it to be. I changed my mentality to not allow the divorce to control my life, but instead to follow my passions and dreams.\\'On my way home from tutoring, I reflected on this remarkable experience. It became clear to me that my parents\\' advice had indeed come true. I realized that the divorce, in a way, was instrumental in getting me to emerge from my shell; I had become more comfortable, rather than embarrassed of sharing my story. Instead of staying the unfortunate victim of the situation, I had changed and become the adviser, helping others cope. I believe this change marked a pivotal point in my development into an emotionally strong young adult. Although my life has not been perfect, this experience has enabled me to rebound from any situation, and helped me continue to focus on the future. \"}, {\"index\": 600, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The lingual frenulum is the thin membrane connected to the tongue and the bottom of the mouth. If the lingual frenulum extends too far up the tongue, it restricts the tongue, which can cause a person to be tongue tied. The most common way of correcting this is through the surgical removal of the lingual frenulum: a lingual frenectomy. I had a lingual frenectomy when I was ten years old. I realized as a young kid that I pronounced some words differently from others. At first, I chalked it up to having an accent, thinking that I probably just picked one up from my parents, both of whom have accents. I couldn\\'t pronounce the \\'r\\' (as in \\'bird\\' or \\'girl\\') or \\'th\\' (as in \\'this\\' or \\'that) sounds, and I had a slight lisp. It wasn\\'t until I was a few years older that I realized I had a speech impediment. My speech impediment sometimes felt like a language barrier. In kindergarten, the other kids didn\\'t understand me when I said my birthday was on the thirteenth of February. In fourth grade, I asked someone for a marker, and they thought I was asking for a mocha. In seventh grade, I asked to buy three tickets for the school musical, and the person selling the tickets thought I was asking for free tickets. It made me more cautious with what I said. Instead of saying the exact date of my birthday, when asked I would just say \\'the day before Valentine\\'s Day.\\' In class, I was terrified that I would be called on unexpectedly and forced to read aloud some horrifying sentence like \\'the thirty-three year old girl has three pet birds.\\' I was constantly embarrassed when I had to repeat myself, so to avoid that, I spoke less in front of large groups of people. I wouldn\\'t answer a question in class if the answer involved any \\'th\\' or \\'r\\' words, and I wouldn\\'t ask questions for the same reason. I hoped that after my lingual frenectomy, my speech would naturally correct itself, but unfortunately, it didn\\'t. I began speech therapy in middle school (which I considered to be some kind of cruel joke, seeing how I couldn\\'t, and still can\\'t, properly pronounce \\'therapy\\'), and it helped. With it, I got rid of my lisp and learned to say \\'r\\' sounds, but my \\'th\\' problem remained. In order to correctly say \\'th\\' sounds, the tongue has to be between the front teeth, and quickly pulled back without the lips ever touching the tongue. Despite my most sincere efforts, my tongue refuses to do this. Sometime between eighth and ninth grade, I stopped caring about my speech impediment. I worked really hard to fix all aspects of it, and honestly, I just got tired of fretting over it, and dedicating so much of my time worrying about my speech and what others would think of me because of it. In elementary school, I was always known as a quiet kid, and I regret letting my speech impediment force that title on me. I realized that if I was going to assume this title in high school, it would be because I chose to be quiet, not because I was scared to speak. I still can\\'t pronounce the \\'th\\' sound; it sounds more like an \\'f\\' or \\'v\\' when I say it, but I no longer allow it to impede me. As conceited as this may sound, I love that over the past few years I\\'ve started to like hearing myself speak. It\\'s a completely new feeling for me. I enjoy public speaking, and have acquired a new sense of confidence in my voice that I never thought I would have. I like to think that I owe it to my little-kid self to speak up in class, and ask all the questions my speech stopped me from asking before.   \"}, {\"index\": 601, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] If I could have picked a soundtrack for the way I had felt in the one instance I saw all my work go down the drain, it would have been a funeral march. After all, I was sending all of my hopes and dreams for the summer to the grave.I had been working at a lab at Johns Hopkins and specifically, with eggplant, trying to discover compounds in it that would be beneficial to human health. After weeks of work though, everything seemed to end in undeniable failure. No matter how hard I tried, the vault of secrets hidden within eggplant would be destined to forever remain locked to me. After an extended discussion with my boss in which we decided that the project was a dead end, eggplant was abandoned.   Eventually, everyone left the lab and went home for the day, leaving me alone with my thoughts and a cold-room full of eggplant. With a lack of anything more productive to do, I walked into the room. The zero-degree Celsius cold-room stripped away the acceptance I had feigned earlier to my boss and I was soon overwhelmed by the anger and disappointment I had hidden so well. I had let a potential scientific publication on eggplant slip through my fingers. Somehow, a vegetable had beat me in a competition of willpower. Remembering that I was the only one in the lab, and looking for a way to release some anger, I grabbed an eggplant, found an empty wall and threw the eggplant at the wall. It bounced right back into my hands. In awe, I threw it at the wall again and again and again. Each time, without fail, it rebounded into my waiting hands.I\\'ve never been the superstitious type and had never believed in signs, particularly not from vegetables because that just didn\\'t make sense, and absolutely not from eggplants because I was holding a massive grudge. But ironically, it was while I was working at a scientific institution that I let myself believe in my first sign. The eggplant was telling me to bounce back. Why should eggplant signify the end of my summer research when I didn\\'t even like it? I had three weeks left and it was time to move on, so I asked my boss the next day for a new project, this one on determining protein concentration in an extremely versatile plant, the Moringa tree. It turns out that this new project was way more my cup of tea anyway. Despite the inevitable Carpal tunnel syndrome from using pipettes for four hours a day, I enjoyed myself far more than I had with eggplant. After all, using pipettes as opposed to a blender actually made me feel like I was working in a lab and not a restaurant. During my last week, I handed my boss all my data. Encouraged, he promised my data a spot in the paper and my name a spot among the authors. I had gotten what I\\'d come for after all.Looking back, what I had thought was a sign from eggplant really wasn\\'t. The eggplant would have bounced back had anyone thrown it against a wall on any day. There were no eggplant gods and I wasn\\'t the \\'chosen one,\\' but eggplant was still to thank for how everything worked out.  What had initially seemed like an awful failure had turned into a great gift. Not only had I achieved what I had been promised at the beginning of the summer with a publication, I had enjoyed myself with this project more than I would have continuing with eggplant. Even more, it had made me realize that failure is okay, as long as I\\'m willing to bounce back from it and pursue other options.  All thanks to a \\'sign\\' delivered by the \\'eggplant gods.\\'  \"}, {\"index\": 602, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] When I was a little girl, my gymnastics coach used to tell me that what nearly breaks you builds you up and makes you stronger. I did not fully understand the meaning of this motto until I had an experience that changed my life forever. In 2006, I went to the doctor expecting to find out I had a sports injury from my training as a competitive gymnast. My life instantly changed when the doctors discovered that the pain in my wrist was not from an injury but rather a poorly understood connective tissue disorder, or simply a chronic illness. My young mind was racing as the doctors spoke of the surgeries, pain and hospital visits that would soon be a regular part of my life.  In my eight years as a gymnast, I had overcome many obstacles and I applied the lessons I learned not only to gymnastics but all aspects of my life. Just months before the diagnosis, I qualified to level eight of ten in competitive gymnastics against many odds. When people asked me how I did it, my answer was simple: perseverance. It is perseverance that helped me push on physically and emotionally after hardships from falling off the beam to losing my mom. Driving home from the doctor\\'s office, I realized the biggest challenges of my life were ahead of me. Even as the harsh reality of my new life set in, the gymnast inside of me knew I was going to somehow find a way to persevere. Persevering became more challenging when my health began to worsen.  I was losing the ability to walk and experienced immense pain every day. I had to be homeschooled my freshman year of high school because of my health and returned to my high school my sophomore year only to be homeschooled again my junior year. Every day was a battle filled with pain and challenges but I pushed through these obstacles as much as I could. I frequently missed school for medical appointments but when I was there I arrived early, stayed late and did everything within my power to keep up. In hands-on classes like Physics, it was very difficult to keep up having missed many labs and demonstrations. My school absences, while not ideal, helped me hone the skill of being able to learn on my own.My time not spent in school, however, was not wasted -- my multiple surgeries never got in the way of me getting an education.  My bedside table saw a variety of materials: books on the War on Terror, a CNN documentary on the Cold War, the most recent election coverage, a mess of Arabic Rosetta Stone CDs and more.  My summers were spent in a similar fashion, as I learned and even led in my comparative political systems course at Georgetown Summer College prior to enrolling in GU. I have undergone more than twenty surgeries and endured more pain than I knew I could bear. Looking back, I am often left wondering how I got through everything. The answer I always come back to is that perseverance has gotten me through these obstacles just as it once helped me succeed as a young gymnast. The people who live the most meaningful lives and have the greatest impact on the world are often the individuals who have experienced great challenges. From a school girl in Africa who is determined to succeed after losing her parents to a survivor of a natural disaster who has found a new outlook on life; tragedy can evoke a sense of re-birth. I have a new lease on life and I wake up every day knowing how much of a gift both life and the acquisition of knowledge truly are. From a conversation with a teacher to dinner with my father; I am appreciating every second. Though I would never have wished this immense struggle upon myself, I am so grateful for the lessons it has taught me. I am a survivor and in the end my coach was right all along; what nearly broke me built me up and made me stronger. \"}, {\"index\": 603, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Sitting in the waiting room surrounded by adults attempting to mask their anxiety, I sifted through books of art as my legs dangled off a vinyl chair. I had accompanied my mother, a Lymphoma patient, on another one of her countless doctor\\'s appointments.  I was born during a short period of health she experienced before relapsing.  After my birth, she underwent a stem cell transplant which resulted in her inability to have any more children.  Without siblings to distract me, books became my waiting room companions.  During these oncology visits, my mother introduced me to a language with no barriers. Together, we read about the lives of artists like Frida Kahlo, admired the tales woven into Faith Ringgold\\'s story quilts, and studied the brush strokes in artworks such as Van Gogh\\'s Sunflowers. I was enchanted by the expressive power of the masterpieces on each page.  Art became a comforting escape for us both.  Reading about various artists sparked my desire to travel to France, a culturally rich destination whose museums famously house some of the best art collections in the world. Medical bills posed a burden on my family that made a trip like this seem impossibly extravagant; nevertheless, we started saving in pursuit of our goal when I was in middle school. I sold my original watercolor paintings to help finance our adventure.  During my freshman year, we finally boarded a plane to cross the Atlantic. We stayed in an apartment one block away from rue Montorgueil, a lively street depicted in a piece by the French painter Claude Monet.  Living in a hub of local Parisian activity for two weeks, I began to recognize the important role of self-expression in their vibrant culture.  As I studied French before and during our stay, I discovered my own aptitude for language.  While my mom was flustered by the local Parisian butcher\\'s impatience toward her limited French lexicon, I took pleasure in the challenge to overcome the language barrier. My family quickly came to rely upon my instinct for decoding unfamiliar signs as I led them through the web of subway lines beneath the streets of Paris.  Successfully guiding my family through a foreign city, I felt the familiar sense of responsibility and self-reliance that I had acquired because of my mother\\'s illness and its residual effects.  The illness that kept my mother looking over her shoulder and focused on survival not only cultivated my life-long appreciation of art, but also allowed me to develop an early sense of independence.  Through cultural experience, I have found that self-expression and communication are invaluable tools for navigating life.  I aspire to invoke a feeling of liberation in others by helping them find their voices through the art of language and giving them the strength to overcome their own adversity.      \"}, {\"index\": 604, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  Before I was born, my parents and brother moved from India to the United States with the hope of tasting the economic freedom they had heard about so often from friends and relatives who visited. With their educations at India\\'s top universities, they knew that the US would live up to its promise of opportunity.  Throughout my childhood, my parents encouraged me to explore India\\'s rich music, languages, and religions. Several years ago, my father noticed me drumming on the table in time with a song that was playing. He realized that I had inherited his sense of rhythm, and he encouraged me to take up Indian percussion. My parents found a nearby teacher, and I soon began taking classes for tabla, an Indian instrument consisting of two drums played with the fingers. Although it took me a few years to become proficient, I eventually gained the enjoyment of music that only insiders experience. Growing up, I found that my family blended Indian culture and American ideals in a way that gave me a profound appreciation for both worlds. My parents showed me the value of respecting tradition, engaging in spirituality, and showing reverence to elders. They also showed me the importance of keeping a broad identity, having an open mind, and treating others with dignity. As a result, I now associate myself with both India and the US, even though I have only visited the country of my parents. In fact, this mix of cultures has almost created a problem for me: I now have to think for a second when someone asks me where I\\'m from, because I truly believe that I am from multiple places, and I can\\'t call just one place my home.  Because of the principles with which my parents raised me, I now aspire to one day use my education and skills to give other people the opportunities that I received, including the ability to learn how to play a musical instrument and learn languages other than English. These experiences have helped me connect with a culture from across the globe, giving me an outlook that would be difficult to attain in the silo of an upbringing grounded in a single culture. Looking back, I see that had my family not encouraged me to see that everyone has a significance, I would not have had the dream of eventually running for public office to make our community even better and bridge gaps between people. I also would not have valued where my parents came from, or the culture that surrounded them when they were growing up. The development of my aspirations in both education and my personal development have given me the purpose I need to guide my efforts, and I truly appreciate the bridge my parents created between the two cultures I call my own. \"}, {\"index\": 605, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'And it has a tail, like this.\\' I made my arm into a squiggly, hopefully flagellum-like tail. I was describing sperm to my 12-year-old camper, Lexus. This seems like a serious overstep of my camp counselor duties. But sadly, Lexus missed out on sex education. Not only did she miss this in her bouts of disciplinary action, but she also had gaps in her math, writing, and reading. Add in a ridiculously high number of incarcerated family members, low income, a single-parent household, and Lexus is a walking statistic. I\\'ve always been intrigued by statistics, but it wasn\\'t until I started working at this summer camp that I learned what those numbers meant.  Only 36% of eighth graders nationwide are at or above reading level. That\\'s just a number\\\\u2014but it\\'s not! That\\'s only 360 kids out of 1000! I love statistics like that because they inspire me. I want to make that statistic higher. 36% is not just a number\\\\u2014statistics represent actual people, like my campers. As troublesome as she can be, Lexus has a lot of potential. Although I frequently had to tell her to stop wasting the glue or to sit back down in her chair, she loved learning new things. Full disclosure: I have terrible print. So, I often times write in cursive instead. One day Lexus noted my flowery script, and excitedly asked me to write down the letters of the alphabet so that she could trace over my handwriting and learn for herself. I was happy to do it. I try to teach my campers new things, or to teach them something above grade level, so that they get ahead in school. I also don\\'t accept negative self-talk. My kids often don\\'t have very strong support systems, and they begin to see themselves as a lost cause. I make it a point to tell them how important they are and how smart they are. These compliments are actually pretty good leverage. When Lexus would take a broken broom out of the storage closet \\'just because,\\' all I would have to do is say that she was doing so well before, and that I was proud of her. She would immediately put the broom back and return to her work. As laborious as my job may be, I find it extremely gratifying. While I have no idea what grades Lexus will get in the following school year, or whether she\\'ll be expelled and have to change schools again, I do know that at least she\\'ll know how the reproductive system works.  \"}, {\"index\": 606, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] From the day I first laid my eyes on a computer screen, I have been absolutely fascinated with technology. I can still remember sitting in my father\\'s lap as a toddler peering into his old laptop and trying to grab the delicious-looking red trackball in the middle of the keyboard. Yes, at the age of two I had an eye for technology. In kindergarten, when I returned home from school, I would enthusiastically run to the now ancient computer and discover something new on PowerPoint 2000. There was nothing more absolutely thrilling to me than technology, an interest that exactly none of my peers shared with me. My friends had even fashioned the nickname \\'tech support\\' for me, a name which I have stayed true to.Throughout elementary and middle school I led my school\\'s SWAT team (Students Who Aid with Technology). I traversed the school during study halls, visiting teachers who needed help with their school laptops, printers or networks. When I reached middle school, I even began generating lessons for my school\\'s computer class. I spent my days twiddling around with MIT\\'s Scratch, Alice and Adobe Photoshop. There was no time I felt more at home than when I was situated in front of a computer.When I entered high school, I was dismayed to discover that my school was devoid of any course that resembled an advanced computer class. Computers and technology education were covered under Business Applications, which addressed topics I had mastered by third grade. Furthermore, I still could not find anyone at school who shared my passion for technology. That was when I decided it was time my school left behind its primitive views and realized how important technology is in today\\'s society: I decided to create a computer club. I chewed on the idea for a year before starting our computer club at the beginning of my sophomore year at Washburn Rural high school. I hoped more than anything that this club would be successful. I also dreamed that I would not only be able to bring together the closeted nerds, but generate a greater interest in technology at my school.The club started off with roughly fifteen members. It has now grown to more than forty students \\\\u2014 enough to fill an entire classroom completely. Now, with two years of experience under my belt, I breeze through lessons as I share the subject I love with a room full of eager faces. I am responsible for running club activities, which joyfully includes teaching members about the world of technology. At this point I have formulated the perfect plan for the club \\\\u2014 a combination of Photoshop techniques followed by a thorough look at HTML and CSS, supplemented by lectures on JavaScript, and with a finishing touch of Java and computer hardware. My club is a mixture of everything needed to get my school interested in technology.I can now speak with confidence when I say that my school is full of young computer-lovers like myself. Although they may not be as skilled as I am, they are slowly and steadily learning with as much joy as I had when I would furtively nibble on those red trackballs when my father was not watching. When I pass down my club to an able underclassman, I know for certain that my dream will stay alive at ****** High School. \"}, {\"index\": 607, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] It\\'s eight o\\'clock on Friday night and I\\'m cell-sitting. As primary cell-caretaker, my job is to stress out the poor cells. This past summer, I studied the effects of microgravity on astronauts\\' bone density when traveling to outer space. My job was to dissect the molecular mechanisms behind this bone degeneration. I applied mechanical stress to bone cells via a stretch device, mimicking the forces that running or jumping applies on bones in our bodies. I expected the mechanical stress to induce greater cell proliferation, which it did. Pondering this data while sitting at my lab bench in the NASA Ames Research Center Bone and Signaling Lab, I began to think more generally about the relationship between stress and health.  I read that short-term stress causes the release of stress hormones, which actually heightens a person\\'s immune response.Society today warns about the harms of stress on your health, your happiness, and your life, but it turns out that stress can also stimulate your body and mind to perform optimally. Just like our bones, when we are not sufficiently challenged, we can atrophy. But with a moderate stimulus, we can grow and thrive. But how do we pinpoint the perfect amount of stress in our lives? It seems all too easy to push too far, and before we know it, we are stressed out.I\\'ve seen this theme play out in my own life as I try to strike the balance between short-term moderate stress and unhealthy chronic stress. At any given moment, I have to weigh my to-do list with leisure activities such as reading, watercoloring, and hiking. But at other times I feel like a juggler with too many balls in the air. I felt this way in the beginning of junior year\\\\u2014taking on new leadership roles in my school\\'s International Space Station Program, Medical Club, and Race2Educate, while formulating my own science fair project. I\\'ve had to learn to say no sometimes so that I don\\'t over-stimulate the osteocytes.This year, as the President of Race2Educate club, which supports the education of kids in Indian slums, I wanted to do something new\\\\u2014a benefit concert. We\\'d discussed it since last year, and now it was my time to make it happen. I found myself in meetings with school administrators, maintenance staff, and musicians nearly every week, pinning down every detail of this school-wide event. As the concert drew nearer, I realized the enormity of the task I was to execute. We expected over a hundred attendees and thousands of dollars in donations. I couldn\\'t put that out of my mind\\\\u2014while doing homework, I constantly checked my email to see if the lighting setup was secured. While at the gym during my Saturday morning BodyStep class, my mind started making mental lists of tasks to assign to my officers. My stress shifted from mild, to moderate, to maximal. Then I remembered those poor little cells\\\\u2014although they were undergoing stress, I was watching over them, making sure they weren\\'t overstressed. I realized that I, too, needed my caretaker\\\\u2014my mom. I delegated the food and decorations to her, alleviating some stress. As the days counted down, I still kept running lists in my head, but thanks to my mom, I was far less stressed than I would\\'ve been had I tried doing it alone. I learned that leaning on a support system is key in attaining the perfect amount of stress.Stretching too far causes cell death. I am acutely aware that society as a whole does not promote healthful practices. We tend to push ourselves to our breaking point, even bragging about how little sleep we get. My research into bone stress and maternal stress has prompted me to pause and think about how I can bring greater awareness and promote healthful practices that maintain optimal levels of stress in our lives. \"}, {\"index\": 608, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] My family and I migrated to the United States in 2006. Filled with hopes of escaping the chains of poverty and inequality that had enslaved our family for generations, we left the world we knew and the language we praised, to embark on a foreign land of possibilities, unhindered by the past. We soon experienced the challenges that many immigrants who made this nation their home also saw: the language barrier, adaptability in a different world of concrete, fast cars, fast food and minimum wages, achievement when knowing so little. With work, patience, ganas and luck, we slowly overcame these barriers, learning English enough to win a local writing contest or becoming a truck driver after not knowing how to drive. But as new Americans, other challenges emerged that encompassed not only the scope of our experience or our family\\'s history but the lives of many Americans like us. I sat with disappointment in an advanced computer science class where the teacher, a church pastor by vocation, just let us roam directionless, choosing to pass the time in silence and ours in the ignorance of cat videos and Facebook. I watched with sadness my teenage Latina friend get pregnant at 14 and quit school, unable to manage the responsibilities of high school, a job and a baby. I learned with bitterness that my friend was beaten unconscious in the middle of class by a guy who doesn\\'t understand homosexuality in front of a silenced teacher who just watched. As I grow more accustomed to my new country, I discover the social disparities that slow us, that enslave us. Unlike the challenges of my early years in America, these are larger issues that involve an entire country and possess less straightforward solutions. How can we eradicate inequality, apathy and hatred in a nation and in the world? How do I make a meaningful difference? These are issues I hope to explore as I grow alongside passionate scholars and wise professors whose desires to transform our society fuel their daily choices. I want to learn from the experiences of great minds of the past and of the present who aspired to transform our nation, to create a more equal, free, accepting and thus powerful America. It is the dream of all immigrants to this country to find in America the freedom to pursue a life of meaning and passion, unburdened by social chains. Our dream nation is far from perfect. As new Americans, we have the responsibility to find ways to build the society in which we once dreamed, the one that empowered us enough to excise ourselves from the culture and the world of our birth. The challenges are mountains, but the foundation that \\'all men are created equal\\' is as strong today as ever and the desire for a just society powerful as ever. It is up to the new and old citizens to bring it alive. \"}, {\"index\": 609, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The lights flicker and then go out. Overwhelming darkness swallows everything. Outside the wind howls, belligerently slamming into our cozy Soviet apartment building. But I\\'m not frightened; I\\'ve grown accustomed to the frequent blackouts. \\'Xiao Hu? Ni hai hao ma?\\' (Little Tiger? Are you okay?) I can hear my mother calling my Chinese nickname. I stumble into the living room and grope around to find the matches and candles. Seconds later, a dancing flame illuminates the room and my family gathers around. Light floods the room, and our hearts are filled with hope and comfort in a foreign land.I don\\'t remember my parents telling me we were leaving California. I was only four when they became missionaries, and we moved to a country 7000 miles away. Thus, Kyrgyzstan is my home. The donkey carts, the sprawling bazaar, the marijuana growing on the main streets, all seem normal. Half-naked children play with plastic bottles, their parents till sunbaked fields, and the average monthly income lingers below $200. I grew up speaking Russian, Kyrgyz, and Dungan; watering our spacious vegetable garden as our neighbors watered theirs; and eating our family meals on a kong (a raised platform where one sits cross-legged around a low table). I\\'ve learned to enjoy the squawking of neighborhood chickens and tolerate the bumpy potholed roads. Indeed, Kyrgyzstan is a major part of who I am.I love fermented horse milk. I can chant the epic \\'Manas.\\' I bargain with overambitious bazaar vendors. I delight in the thrills of galloping down a mountain. I smile at a plate of beef brain. I cherish the smell of flat bread, fresh from spherical mud ovens. These are gifts from my homeland. They are pieces of my identity. True, I cannot ignore the pungent burning trash or the malnutrition and poverty, but I can choose to love my country despite its imperfections.However, patriotism hasn\\'t always been easy. Since first grade at a local school, I realized I couldn\\'t understand many foreign terms and couldn\\'t ask my parents for help. To make matters worse, I was often bullied for my nationality. My grades fell. I felt like Kyrgyzstan hindered my education. I probably would have dropped out before middle school and gone to the American school in the capital like most international kids, but a spark inside of me was unwilling to give up. It glowed increasingly brighter until, bursting into flame, I became determined to succeed in three languages. So I juxtapose Mark Twain, Lev Tolstoy, and Chinghiz Aitmatov. I memorize trigonometry theorems in multiple languages. I self-study and home school in English. And I clutch my Americanism while acting local.I love Kyrgyzstan and want to see it thrive. My heart cringes when I see hardships and broken families drive youths to take drugs, join gangs, or become involved in Muslim terrorist movements. The Christian youth center where I volunteer offers alternatives to destructive behaviors with activities, discussions, and mutual growth. At one point, I was just an eager listener wanting to avoid life\\'s messes, but I have since become one of the three leaders of this organization. Whether I am speaking, acting, or playing in the band, I find joy in lifting other youth out of the swamps of life.I want to see Kyrgyzstan\\'s youth benefit society and avoid the black, perilous road. I know I can help even more effectively after college. I\\'m prepared to strive and rise above challenges, just as I did in Kyrgyzstan. I\\'ll be thinking of Central Asian teenagers while I\\'m gone, but I\\'m ready to move on to my next stage in life. After all, I am no longer a little boy in a dark room. My Kyrgyz name is Nurbek \\\\u2013 bringer of light and good. And that\\'s exactly who I plan to be. \"}, {\"index\": 610, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I used to turn over every single stone I found when I was in middle school. I\\'d sit down and painstakingly look up every one of my findings in an encyclopedia of rocks and minerals; then I\\'d draw them, write about them, get up at night to arrange them again and again. Soon cardboard boxes overflowed with them, and my mother tried to throw them out despite my protest and tears. Obsessed with making the best collection, I began to discard any rocks with any visible imperfection, all the while feeling excruciating regret over the loss. Then I\\'d go outside the next morning to repeat the cycle, both its creator and its slave. As I got older and more self-conscious, I didn\\'t stare so much at the ground as I stared into myself. Before I knew it, my mind had arrived at a beach, where all you could see or hear were stones clattering against each other with the rhythm of the tide. I felt dread at their sheer number because I knew that I would pick every one up, putting them in my pockets until I was weighed down completely, crawling on my belly.There were times when my mental stamina failed and I found myself in a perpetual state of exhaustion from chasing my train of thought. It was so infuriating that I\\'d scream: why did God make me like this? All the while, I\\'d try to trace with my mind where my prayer was going; whether it had been consumed in the air, or found its way to my God from childhood that I\\'d grown cold towards--or perhaps He\\'d grown cold towards me. So I lost my existential foothold entering high school, growing distant from religion and my parents. I think the true change began, however, when I read Hesse\\'s coming-of-age novel and imagined a Demian in my life; when I became Emil Sinclair, exploring the world of light and dark in my own way. I felt so intensely understood by the novel, strangely touched by the words forming meaning in my brain.Walking through the halls of the New York MoMA for the first time, I felt a similar sense of understanding, and was convinced that the ashes of every artist are mixed in with their paints. Thus their souls remain dormant inside their art until willing viewers look at their masterpieces; I always find Rothko waiting for me at exhibitions, his paintings waking up and staring back into me when I stare at them. It\\'s a moment of spiritual contact-- I break free from the silence of daily life, breathing in as painting breathes out.The cathartic nature of expression is a powerful and healing force; the process of appreciating art is highly personal because the battles of struggle and spirituality are inherent in our existence. The weight of a rock never changes, but we as humans moved onto etching languages and drawing on finer surfaces long ago. So I turn my gaze up and fix my eyes on the largeness of the world, mesmerized by the sheer volume of things to appreciate and study. Nowadays, I just walk upon the rocks, feet bare, letting them hold me up. \"}, {\"index\": 611, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] On the eve of my first day of fourth grade, I was sitting beneath the window of my living room, absentmindedly catching shards of sunlight on my spoon, when I brought up a memory of four years earlier. My five-year-old heart had been shattered when the odd dirt that engulfed every inch of my father\\'s hometown in rural China had caked over my light-up sneakers, and I was making an off-handed inquiry as to what it was.My dad just laughs, sounding suspiciously of schadenfreude, and says \\'It\\'s chicken poop.\\'It is incredibly sobering to look at everything that has ever made you happy and realize how precarious it is. This morning I was practicing Brahms, balancing this chord or that grace note until the ivory keys became merely a tether to a universe of melodies, harmonies, and rests that held just as much beauty in their silence as a chord does in its song. Yesterday I took a detour from my routine jog to wade through a field of crackling grass, seeping back into the dirt in submission to the crisp autumn air, and realized that even as the last hues of orange and blue retreated to a soft line at the horizon, Rochester never taught me to be afraid of the dark. Nine years ago, my dad stood next to me on the carousel for the millionth time. I had been too afraid to go on any of the real rides and was instead delighted by the twinkling lights, the jovial beat of trumpets and accordions, and the faded screams and purring engines in the distance, but my dad was still smiling and my mom hadn\\'t grown bored of taking pictures.And yet, if Bor-Luh Lin never came to China, never met my dad, or never offered to become his doctoral advisor in the U.S., I may still be trapped beneath the oppressive smog of Guangzhou, sealed behind the walls of an oven, and never know what it is like to run free as a child, curious and unafraid. And if Mao Zedong never died and my father never went to college, I could have grown up barefoot in chicken poop, never even having the opportunity to argue with my mom about school. But they did and I didn\\'t; I grew up alive and free and lucky.My dad was a patron of math and logic, always ready with another story about infinite hotel rooms or blue-eyed men on an island, but it was only when I realized the fragility of my circumstance that I learned to fall in love with the complexity and solidarity only found in the immutable truths of mathematics. I always had the privilege to learn how an airplane flies, why the Roman Empire fell, or how to translate emotions into English, but it was only when I reached for it that I discovered the marvel of the universe unraveling to show its secrets, and realized that learning was never rewarding when it was easy, only when I fought through the frustration, lost myself in the pursuit, and found that moment of complete devotion to the answer.I remind myself that the world of knowledge is vast, beautiful, and ever-expanding, and it\\'s a blessing that I am able to even grasp at it. I tell myself I must fling open the unlocked doors of each new day. Yet, I must remember that others had been opening those doors for me before I was even born, that I cannot contribute to the entropy of goodwill, and that I must give as much as I have taken. Helping a friend understand calculus or comforting a child while volunteering may be a drop in the ocean, but my entire life is comprised of a million drops from a million people. I never understood what it meant to live until I understood what it meant to breathe. \"}, {\"index\": 612, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'We went to save them, but they saved us.\\' These were the poignant words one of my companions on a mission trip to Gros Morne, Haiti, upon our return home. There were nine of us in total: bright-faced students filled with the philanthropic dream she so eloquently described. However, the true humanitarian would find a flaw in her statement \\\\u2013 it is self-centered. She is the alpha and the omega; the one who took on this trip to be a Savior, and the one who returned from this trip as an Educated Individual. From this lens, it was a trip of voluntourism \\\\u2013 not one of volunteerism.These weren\\'t my intentions when I, an idealistic sixteen-year old, accepted my mission and boarded the plane on a cold February morning with my classmates, our chaperones, and our organizers from Focus on Haiti. My intentions were to do something \\\\u2013 to, as hopeful as it was, make a change. However, it was only after having spent an afternoon setting up mosquito nets in the destitute Irish Village, on the third day of our visit, that I felt the mission part of our trip begin.\\'I felt like I actually did something,\\' confessed another companion at our evening reflections \\\\u2013 but was what we did enough? I can give a report of all I did \\\\u2013 I painted a house for the homeless elderly a bright, happy green; I bought millet from a poor lady and flattered her malnourished son with my attention; I spent time daily with girls who attended Mercy Beyond Borders\\' high school; I visited schools and worked with the children, the youngest of whom were reluctant to give up their fear of us blancs \\\\u2013 and while they were great things, were they the best things? Were they even the right things? We were unskilled students, unable to compare to the company of greats that surrounded us: Sister Karen Schneider, a pediatrician who saved lives in the earthquake five years ago, and Papa, our amicable driver who, every day during the earthquake, drove refugees from Port-au-Prince to Cap-Haitien, eight hours away.In turn, what had I done? Give Sweethearts to the malnourished children of the Irish Village, who swarmed towards me, hands outstretched, yelling \\'blanc\\'? Let the schoolchildren of Fon Ibo wear my sunglasses, and laugh with them as I showed them their likenesses in my photos? Teach them how to work a camera? I was useless at the clinic, watching the Haitian nurse efficiently check an infant for malnutrition. I swam in a local river, climbed two mountains and admired the breathtaking view \\\\u2013 all voluntourist behavior.One night during reflection, Papa commented on something he had seen: my friends and I joining Haitian schoolgirls during their recess to play a game reminiscent of Duck-Duck-Goose. He said that such a thing gave him hope for the future, to see American girls play side-by-side with Haitian girls. His speech raised questions that I still grapple with today. My mission was not to save these people \\\\u2013 nor could I. This mission was never even about me.This idea seems counterintuitive to what we understand of mission trips, or of service as a whole. Even for those people like me who enjoy doing service for the sheer goodness of it (for the way it manifests itself in crooked, sunburst smiles upon the faces of others or the buzzing feeling that sits below your heart), the idea that service is for the one serving is something instilled in us. The mission trip narrative often centers on the server \\\\u2013 the middle-class American who learns to cherish their privilege after spending time with the adorable, joy-filled-yet-impoverished third-world children they encountered on the trip.I intend to change that narrative and refocus the lens with which we view service. My mission to Gros Morne was about the people I met there, and our union as a global community determined to bring about change. \"}, {\"index\": 613, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] On the first day of sailing program this summer, I walked toward the river with my trusty yellow lifejacket slung over my shoulder. Smiling as I inhaled the salty air, I was filled with the usual first-day anticipation for the eight weeks I was about to spend on the water. The sights and sounds of the waterfront felt so familiar that I almost forgot something was different this year: instead of being a sailor in the program as I had been for the past decade, I was now an instructor. As the members of my class began to trickle in, I noticed nervous looks on some of their faces. I could relate to how they were feeling because just ten short summers ago, I was in their shoes.  As an eight-year-old who was just starting her sailing career, I had wondered how I was ever going to master this mysterious new skill when I didn\\'t even know the first thing about boats. I soon found out that the answer was simple: my instructors would teach me everything I needed to know. These two teenagers, one of whom was still in high school and the other who was barely in college, became some of my most influential role models. As a novice sailor, I had so much respect for their knowledge and as the summer progressed I aspired to be just like them. To me, my instructors held the answer to any question I could ask. As I thought back on how much I looked up to my first instructors, I started to realize how much responsibility I now held. This summer, it was my turn to be the role model. It was my turn to elucidate the mysteries of sailing and pass on my knowledge to an energetic group of young sailors. It was my turn to be enthusiastic and patient and willing to help my students learn. In the eyes of these kids, I was now the one with all the answers.  Being a sailing instructor turned out to be every bit as demanding as I thought it would be, but it also turned out to be so much more rewarding than I imagined. At the beginning of the summer I was entrusted with a class of brand new sailors, and each day it was up to me to capture their interest while making sure they were safe, learning, and having fun. At the end of eight weeks, all of them could confidently control a sailboat on their own. My proudest moment was watching the most timid member of my class sail back to the dock with a huge smile on his face after his first time in a sailboat alone. It had taken days to convince him to even get in the boat at all, and helping him overcome his fear was a major accomplishment. Sailing is what they call a lifetime sport \\\\u2013 it\\'s something I know I will continue to enjoy for a long time to come. Sailing satisfies my natural curiosity because my desire to improve encourages me to always ask questions and keep learning. As a young sailor I looked up to my instructors because I thought they knew everything there was to know about the sport, but as an instructor I realized that even when I\\'m the one teaching there will always be something more to master. Lessons of responsibility, teamwork, and being adaptive to any situation have not only helped me become a better sailor, but they have also carried over and made me stronger as a person. My favorite part, though, is that deep down underneath all my technical knowledge and the confident persona I have developed, I still feel like that curious little girl who discovered that all she needs to enjoy the sport of sailing is wind, water, and a little bit of patience. \"}, {\"index\": 614, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 615, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'Anything?\\' I asked, with an air of incredulity and excitement that rarely graces U.S. History classroom 2048 fromthe hours of 7:30-2:30 on a typical school day.\\'Yes, Aaron,\\' my teacher replied, slouched against the chalkboard and with a disinterested tone. \\'Anything.\\'Never had I been given such a vague assignment. Exploring one discrete piece of history with a month of classtime could lead to an infinite variety of possibilities. As I exited the classroom, I entered a daze of sorts, with somany thoughts bouncing around my head, further feeding the beast of excitement that would propel me headlonginto this project.Exactly one month later, I stood on the corner of Pine and Buckingham in Waterbury, CT. Glancing around, I notedthe immense irony of the street being named after a tree; the only vegetation there consisted of weeds clawingtheir way through decrepit picket fences and weathered asphalt. Nothing else about the several signs of abjectpoverty and dilapidation made me laugh. I looked up toward what had once been a colonial mansion and was nowa multi-family home. An entire floor had smashed-in windows, just a few of which had wooden boards ineffectuallyprotecting the house from the chilly autumn air. My watch alerted me that I was due at address 170C in oneminute: close my eyes, deep breath in, deep breath out, and go.Studying the Jewish community in Waterbury proved to be far more interesting than I expected. That first awkwardencounter in the Bresner kitchen was one of many interviews, the most memorable of which took place in thecommunity\\'s sacred centerpiece: the synagogue. Rabbi Sonnenschein spoke with wisdom and deliberation,though beneath his thick beard and underneath his black hat, he was just a man in his late thirties. He describedhow he pioneered a Waterbury hakkel, a school for men who were a part of the secular workforce by day andstudied scripture into the late evening hours. With a bright gleam in his eyes, he recounted the evolution of justeleven families into a thriving community of 1,000 within a fifteen year span.Rabbi Sonnenschein served as an oracle of sorts for me; he told me exactly where to find all I needed to knowabout Waterbury\\'s Jewish history. During my month-long scavenger hunt, I tracked down twenty interviewees,collected a dozen hours of interview footage, studied the archives of a local museum, and filled two compositionnotebooks in the process.I pull off the highway at Exit 32, leaving the dense rush of metal and inserting myself into the city that I had lookedupon with such uncertainty nearly two years ago. As I drift through the streets, I wonder what would wait for me if Ihad pulled off at Exit 33 or 34. Would I be struck with the same discomfort that I felt my first time here? What hadonce seemed so foreign was now familiar. As I reach the corner of Pine and Buckingham, the thought that eachgreen exit sign has its own richly complex community enters my mind. I dared to explore just one community, onestory, and that choice has left me with close friends and a connection that remains strong today.Although the people I interviewed thought I was doing them a favor in documenting their community\\'s story, I amthe one who benefitted; the project opened my eyes to the fact that every place is unique, full of interesting people,and this fact has left me yearning to explore every new city I drive by, to introduce myself to every new person Ipass on the street. So, yes, my mind winds its way back onto the highway, at seventy miles per hour at least,thinking about what lies beyond the next curve, off the next exit. I am an explorer now, and all the better for it. \"}, {\"index\": 616, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] If there\\'s something stressful in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? Stress-Busters! If there\\'s too much pressure and you don\\'t feel good, who you gonna call? Stress-Busters!Ah, stress: while I can\\'t simply wave a magic wand and make it disappear, that won\\'t stop me from trying to find a solution. Behind my test scores, transcript, and list of extracurricular activities, I, like many of my peers, struggle with academic-related stress. Whether I\\'m studying for calculus tests, memorizing lines for the school play, or filling out college applications, I\\'m stressed. Some may feel as though stress is no big deal, but as stress levels soar among students across the nation, issues such as depression and anxiety rise in tandem. A 2013 survey administered to the students at my school found that 21% believe that their lives have no purpose, despite our town\\'s boasts of \\'academic excellence.\\'Although I strive to move on and learn from my mistakes with confidence and optimism, I still haven\\'t figured out how to completely eliminate the occasional feelings of isolation, self-doubt, or drowning in work.During my sophomore year, I was invited to attend my town\\'s first \\'Community Conversation\\' as the sole student representative to discuss how stress affects our youth. Despite some initial apprehension, I was determined to make my voice heard. After continuing to attend meetings and work sessions to brainstorm ideas for a solution to stress, I helped to form the Stress Management Task Force, informally known as the \\'Stress-Busters,\\' as a follow-up committee.As a Stress-Buster, I recruited several high schoolers for one of our events. Held at the middle school, the event was open to the public and featured \\'Race to Nowhere,\\' a documentary about the negative impact of stress on American children. After the screening, the students participated in an honest, eye-opening discussion with concerned parents, teachers, and other community members.However, education is just the first step, and there are still many gains to be made in this area. I\\'m currently in the midst of organizing workshops for parents and students, which will deal directly with topics such as stress management and coping skills. At the moment, I\\'m working with local organizations, namely the town\\'s Alcohol and Drug Education Coalition and the Youth and Family Services, but I\\'ve also collaborated with the Early Childhood Coalition and the local public library.  Last year, I helped to draft a revised version of the public school system\\'s homework policy to include provisions to benefit students and lower their stress levels. For example, all classes that assign more than 30 minutes of homework every day must indicate in the official program of studies how long an average night\\'s worth of homework should take. Then, students will receive blank schedules with their programs so they can plan out different courseloads before deciding which classes to take. That way, stress due to over-scheduling will be greatly reduced. We introduced the modified policy to the Board of Education, and it has since been implemented throughout the entire school system.Next on the Stress-Busters\\' list is the issue of overly demanding youth sports. We plan to contact the director of our town\\'s athletics to propose the idea of sports-free Sundays so that families can spend a day every week together and students can have a day to catch up with friends, homework, or much-needed relaxation.Even though I\\'ll never be able to completely eliminate stress in my community, I\\'ll continue working to alleviate some of the pressure my peers face. Already, students, especially in the elementary and middle schools, have commented on beneficial changes, ranging from reduced workloads to more extra-help sessions after school with teachers. Hopefully, the number of people who feel as though their life has meaning apart from the academic race toward \\'excellence\\' will soon increase across the country, not just in my community, as we work together to reform our stress-filled society. \"}, {\"index\": 617, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  Growing up in middle class suburbia can make a person blind to his or her comforts. While I have always tried to be aware of my privilege, I am not always able to put into perspective just how well-off I am compared to other children in the world. I joined the Junior State of America (JSA) in the fall of 2014. The Junior State is an organization that strives to increase social and political awareness through debates, discussions, and activism. By being a part of this organization, I have learned that every person has a voice. I first experienced this during the Spring State convention of 2015. Over the course of two days, a few hundred students raised over $4,000 to help fund education for a young girl in Africa. We managed to use our voices to help someone find theirs.JSA has allowed me to mentally bridge the gap between a voter and someone who is active in government. The state of Texas has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the country. This is often attributed to a feeling of detachment between the government and voting populations. If the population feels as if they cannot trust the government, how can they be expected to continue voicing their opinions? Some people combat this detachment by becoming lobbyists or writing to congressmen. Others feel as if they are unable to make a difference no matter the effort they put forth. It is unfortunate that many people in the world are afraid to or are unable to speak about things that concern them.In addition to my JSA activities, I have been actively working with my Girl Scout troop, my school, and other organizations to increase awareness of social, political, and academic issues that this country currently faces. As part of my Gold Award project, the highest award in Girl Scouting, I am hosting seminars encouraging elementary school children from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers. It is amazing to see the kids light up as they begin to understand principles from each major STEM field. I see them gaining appreciation of the things they are learning in class as they learn applications of the material and finding a new joy in learning. I am also actively working with Lamar University\\'s chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to bring awareness to the public about social issues. Lamar\\'s NAACP along with other student organizations has hosted events bringing students and local law enforcement together to address student concerns about police brutality. Students get to directly confront their fear, and officers have opportunity to detail their plans to keep everyone safe. These events have helped ease tensions among the student body and promoted a sense of unity between police and civilians. Working with these organizations has allowed me to realize the importance of community and being vocal. As I continue throughout my life, I intend to use my voice, however limited, to create opportunity to amplify the voices of others.As I continue my education, I intend to study biomedical engineering. While the previously mentioned organizations allow me to indirectly impact lives, engineering is a way to directly affect global populations. I am interested in developing precision medicine to help combat genetic diseases. Many people who suffer from genetic diseases are forced to live without hope for a cure. I believe that the concept of precision medicine is something that could be attained with a few years of research. Precision medicine uses genome sequencing to create treatments that target specific genetic codes. Scientists have found genetic links to schizophrenia, cancer, and other diseases. If it is possible to treat these diseases at the root instead of on the surface, I can only imagine that they will not take long to eradicate. Of course, each person\\'s genetics has to take part in the medical process. By using bioinformatics, this wealth of information could be compressed to represent a majority of people. While the concept of personal medicine is still in its infancy, I feel that it could radically change the world and the medical field.Overall, I wish to affect change in the world whether it be as simple as encouraging someone to vote or as phenomenal as eradicating a disease. I know that I have been given many opportunities that other people have not and would like to use these opportunities to make someone\\'s world better. \"}, {\"index\": 618, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Praseodymium. \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018What a fascinating name for such an unexceptional element,\\' I thought as I stared at my blank sketchbook page. Attempting to create an original cartoon character for praseodymium made me feel like a mother trying to dress up her child for a concert with clothing from a thrift store.I had a lot more materials to work with for the other elements. Carbon is the \\'king of the periodic table\\' for its unmatched versatility; it forms fancy diamonds on wedding rings, graphite in pencils, and the basis of all life. To highlight these features, I drew a king with grey, diamond-studded skin smiling warmly at a bluebird perched upon a branch. I visualized nitrogen, a gas added to fertilizers that help feed billions of people, as a turquoise critter floating by a tall cornstalk. Palladium, a metal that efficiently traps gas in the cracks between its atoms, became a bulky man spotted with gas bubbles of varying sizes. Praseodymium was still a white piece of paper with the notes \\'rare earth metal\\' and \\'a minor component of mischmetal alloy\\' scribbled on the top right corner.Even the mountain of chemistry books piled next to my desk did not have enough information on praseodymium. The internet was also frustratingly bare; I only found online variations of my two flimsy jottings. I ventured to my father\\'s office and found The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe by Theodore Gray. There was an entire spread devoted to the elusive metal that explained how praseodymium is used to make didymium glasses, safety lenses worn by glassblowers and blacksmiths so they can stare at fires without harming their eyes.Soon enough, I filled the previously blank page with multiple character designs, six digit color codes like #e90202 and #ffaf02 to specify the color scheme, and a labelled photo of didymium glasses to serve as a visual reference. I chose my favorite sketch and digitized it in Photoshop, covering the light pencil marks with 15 pixel thick lines and painting the outline with vibrant colors. After a couple of hours, I contently stared at the simple but accurate personification of praseodymium displayed on my computer screen: a silver-skinned boy wearing a large pair of goggles staring excitedly into a roaring fire. By the time I completed this process for every element on the periodic table, I had 118 mangled sheets of paper stacked on my desk, a USB flash drive filled to its maximum capacity, and a six year old Wacom drawing tablet malfunctioning from overuse.My anthropomorphized elements debuted in the book The Cartoon Periodic Table and my website. Underclassmen taking chemistry courses bookmarked my site. Familiar names like hydrogen and carbon hogged most of the views, but even obscure elements like praseodymium received some clicks amid the traffic. A 180 centimeter long version of my cartoon periodic table will be displayed at a gallery in March. Thanks to this project, my dream of becoming a science communicator has started becoming a reality.Whenever I see my cartoon periodic table, I remember its humble beginnings: a collection of rough sketches piled in a corner of my stuffy attic. Rays of sunlight shining on my desk and Facebook photos of friends posing in front of the Eiffel Tower had mocked me for spending an entire vacation sifting through chemistry textbooks. However, I enjoyed the thrill of inching closer to completion one element at a time. I enjoyed making improvements to my designs in a pursuit of perfection. Most of all, I enjoyed overcoming unexpected challenges like praseodymium along the way. \"}, {\"index\": 619, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  Hailing from opposite ends of Asia, my \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Traditional Asian\\' parents grew up in rural areas and had to fight for every single penny and dime. In fact, they immigrated to Hong Kong to set me up for prosperity and to give me a range of academic opportunities. However, as an only child of immigrant parents and as the first person in my family to apply to college, a lot of expectations were thrust upon me. I am expected to be a straight-A student. I am expected to be a doctor. I am expected to settle down with a wife and three children. My parents had set up a one-way path for me to trek through. This path had few scenic routes and I was constantly reminded to stay on their trail. However, as I matured, I found a forbidden fork in this path that had nothing to do with grades or jobs, but rather with who I was \\\\u2014 a path of acknowledging my identity. I started to question my sexual orientation and gender identity. I was born a male, so my mom never let me play with the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018girl\\' toys, wear \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018girl\\' clothes, or do \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018girly\\' things. Many believe that \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018gender\\' and \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018sex\\' are interchangeable terms, but they are not. \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Sex\\' is the box I am forced to tick \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018male\\' every time I fill in a form. \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Gender\\' is who I truly am.  Initially, I had difficulty coming to terms with myself. Every night I would lie in my velvety bed staring at my ceiling filled with glow-in-the-dark stars pretending to gaze into the galaxy. My physics teacher once told me that sound cannot travel through outer space so I spent countless nights letting out all my feelings into a seemingly dark abyss \\\\u2014 speaking freely as if no one could hear me. I would always ask myself the question \\'What is wrong with me?\\' However, after my best friend came out as bisexual in eighth grade, a realization dawned upon me \\\\u2014 my differences made me unique rather than abnormal. Many people in Hong Kong believe that \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018being different\\' is a shameful quality. At first, this conservative environment pressured me to lose my identity and to act against my nature. However, after hearing my cousin use homophobic slurs, I decided to stop being acquiescent to the intolerant society around me by taking an initiative. Since there is little to no support for LGBTQ students in Hong Kong, I decided to start the first in-school LGBTQ club during my freshman year. Although only three people showed up to the first meeting, I continued with the club because I wanted to give guidance to those around me and to change the status quo. I was always there to support my peers, even if it meant that my phone would ring at 3 in the morning. This perseverance has helped establish the club as an active student group with a diverse community. By successfully creating a safe space for LGBTQ students, I have alleviated some of the difficulties they may face during their journey of self-acceptance. Starting an LGBTQ activist and support group in a conservative place like Hong Kong challenged me in exceptional ways. I had to face the idea of potentially losing all my friends. I had to face ridicule when the club was first considered as an extracurricular activity. I had to face criticism from teachers and parents who deemed it as \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018inappropriate\\'. However, despite these obstacles, I am proud that the first in-school LGBTQ club in Hong Kong will serve as my legacy and continue to persist after I graduate. While I might not fulfill my parents\\' expectations and become the doctor who discovers the cure to cancer, I will be the person that ensures that everyone has equal rights and access to that cure. My parents might not be proud of who I become \\\\u2014 but I will. \"}, {\"index\": 620, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]                                                                         To My Eleven Year Old Self    Has there ever been a moment when your parent first failed you? My twelfth grade English teacher asked this question to me and twenty-nine other students. Silence engulfed the room as each student recollected their memories. My mind, on the other hand, was struggling to grasp onto a cloudy memory of a man with caramel skin. I tried desperately to focus on the memory, but the vision only became more distorted until it finally vanished.    The only things on which my mind could concentrate were the German cars and massive houses I saw during the bus ride to my first day of elementary school. It was already difficult to walk into a class where my caramel skin and dark curly hair stood out amongst the fair-skinned students with light straight hair. But nothing could compare to the crushing blow I felt whenever anyone asked me about my father. I would mumble about how he was busy in Virginia with his job and switch the subject to my maternal adventures. There was not much to say about my father; except for the occasional phone calls that were filled with forced conversations and long gaps of silence, we did not communicate with each other.    Despite this, I craved the stability and normalcy of a nuclear family structure. I wanted to brag about how my father took me to the movies, to the zoo, or out for ice cream. So, I accepted the challenge to make this into a reality. I pushed myself to get As and Bs and bit my tongue after he said I needed to do better after glancing at my report card. I even kept a smile on my face after my father would say, \\'We\\'ll see\\', when I asked him for something even though we both knew this meant no. Throughout elementary school, I put on a mask in front of my father and would play the role as the perfect daughter and pretend that my family life was stable. Eventually, the mask became suffocating; the role was becoming more monotonous. To my father, I was the boa constrictor that was obstructing his freedom and making him feel trapped and restricted. I was the nuisance that prevented my father from playing golf on a Saturday afternoon since my mother had arranged for us to spend time with each other. He was a ghost fading into thin air and I spent the majority of my time during elementary school trying to make him stay. Nonetheless, he disappeared; I let him.    What did you learn from the experience?    My teacher\\'s question pulled me back to reality. It has been about six years since I last saw my father. For the majority of these six years, anger and guilt constantly battled in my mind. However, a thought occurred to me one day: it was never my responsibility to force a relationship with my father. For years, I put the blame on myself and how, no matter what I did, I would always disappoint him. I never considered the fact that he was not willing to try to be a father. My father was fading into a foggy forgotten memory in my mind; it did not bother him. While it was hard to adjust to the absence of my father, I immediately enjoyed the liberty of taking risks in my life. Before, the constant pressure of perfection consumed me as I meticulously worried about each mistake I made. But without my father\\'s controlling presence, I was willing to explore a field of STEM. With that in mind, I cautiously raised my hand and answered my teacher. I said what I would have told my eleven year old self:  \\'Sometimes, it is not your fault\\'. \"}, {\"index\": 621, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] In the fall of sophomore year, I fell in love with a girl in the grade above me.Her laugh was infectious. Sometimes she would end up on the floor, curled up with the force of her own hilarity, gasping for breath. When she hugged me, it was all warmth.And when she realized that I had a hopeless crush on her, she pulled away. Stopped talking to me. It shouldn\\'t have been a surprise, not really. And I wasn\\'t surprised. There was an odd aching hurt under my ribs every time she turned away, but it wasn\\'t quite surprise. Just a deflated sort of sadness.Once, desperate for the slightest token of attention, I stole her softball jacket and wore it to physics class. While the teacher lectured on the force of gravity and the angle of an inclined plane, I inhaled the warm way she smelled. Almost like she was holding me. Not quite enough.I grew up in a devoutly Christian family. Every Sunday, we go to church, whether it was the first one in the woods of Connecticut or the last one, where my father now serves as priest. The main message of the church has always been love, first and foremost. Love of God for the world, love of humans for each other.The concept of pride\\\\u2014of being so proud of who I was that I proclaimed it to the whole world\\\\u2014has been a hard thing for me to grasp with regards to my sexuality. It is, after all, one of the deadly sins. Haughty eyes and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, are sin: Proverbs 21:4. From a young age, I had been told, indirectly and directly, that homosexuality was a sin, that it went against the natural order of the world. One of my earlier memories\\\\u2014I was six or so, in the vestibule of the Connecticut church, and pasted to the window behind a set of cast-iron bells was a bumper sticker that read Marriage: one man, one woman. I didn\\'t understand what that meant because every married couple I knew was heterosexual. Love, though\\\\u2014I could understand that.Love is patient and kind, love does not envy or boast, it is not arrogant: 1 Corinthians 13:4. When I realized who I was, when holding a girl\\'s hand in the snow made my heart stutter, I also knew what my faith said about this kind of love. But being a Christian was just as much a part of my identity\\\\u2014Sunday morning incense that smells like bitter roses, late night candlelight gilding the air, rich embroidered fabric rustling in time to ancient hymns. So instead of rejecting a faith that said I could not love who I wanted to love, I went deeper. Read more, asked more questions\\\\u2014and found answers that were difficult, but gave me hope.For God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son...The Orthodox church is not one that preaches hate in any form. Love above all, for deity and enemy and neighbor. Love as a way of life, because a true Christian should overflow with love for everything and everyone they see.And love, you see, can never be a sin.Bridging two halves of myself\\\\u2014my faith and my sexuality\\\\u2014is a constant battle to accept and love who I am. Often, it is more painful than worth it. Someday, by the grace of God and by my own effort, I might find a way that works. Humans are always a work in progress, always learning, and I have years and decades of learning still to do.In the end, the girl never loved me back. But what she taught me was to seek answers to the questions I have, how to forge a satisfying compromise between things that might seem complete opposites at first\\\\u2014but end up being very much the same at their core. \"}, {\"index\": 622, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I stand in the wings, waiting for the music to begin. The familiar sensation of butterflies in my stomach begins to set in, and the other dancers and I shoot nervous grins at each other. But when Tchaikovsky\\'s first sweeping crescendo beckons us onstage, I experience a moment of clarity: the choreography comes naturally after months of rehearsal, my heart pounds fast with exhilaration, and I can\\'t help but smile. I wasn\\'t always so confident in expressing emotion through movement. My ballet teacher, Mr. Magnus, used to say I had a \\'personality problem.\\' While my dancing exhibited proper placement and technique, it lacked the emotion and artistry\\\\u2014the \\'personality\\'\\\\u2014that allows a dancer to truly connect with the audience. Throughout my ten years of ballet, I came to admire Mr. Magnus for his ability to put his own personality on vivid display. During one particularly memorable rehearsal of our studio\\'s annual production of The Nutcracker, he strode into the room and promptly asked the class, \\'What does a bear say at the start of a race?\\' When a student responded with the answer (\\'ready, teddy, go\\'), Mr. Magnus wheeled around, pointed at them with his whole arm, and exuberantly proclaimed his love for them. He then proceeded to give us our warm-up pli\\\\u00e9 combination as if nothing had ever happened. Mr. Magnus managed to infuse playful humor into an otherwise serious pursuit, and as I looked to him as an example over the years, I grew from a timid and self-conscious dancer into a confident artist able to forge an emotional connection with her audience.In September of my sophomore year of high school, an ankle injury forced me to hang up my pointe shoes and bid adieu to my lifelong pursuit of ballet. But even as I turned my attention to other pursuits, Mr. Magnus\\'s lessons on the importance of \\'personality\\' stayed with me.Nearly one year later, I found myself in the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C., awaiting the final rounds of national competition for my high school\\'s Constitution Team. As I sat next to my teammates on the edge of the hard wooden bench, the churning sensation in my stomach felt all-too-familiar: it reminded me of the countless moments of nervous anticipation before stepping onstage to perform a piece of choreography. I clutched my teammates\\' hands, acutely aware of my sweaty palms and burning cheeks, my heart feeling as if it might pound of out my chest at any moment. After thirteen months of research and practice rounds, I wanted nothing more than for my genuine interest in the subject matter\\\\u2014my \\'personality\\'\\\\u2014to shine through. I was waiting in the wings of a very different kind of performance, and I was scared to step onstage. But when I did step onstage\\\\u2014when I sat down beside my teammates, folded my hands on top of the dark wooden table, looked the judges in the eye, and leaned into the microphone\\\\u2014I felt as if I was performing a ballet I had rehearsed countless times. From explaining King George\\'s influence on the Fourth Amendment to arguing against the use of drones as a violation of privacy rights to analyzing the constitutional implications of the NSA\\'s metadata program, I leapt and twirled and spun across the stage of constitutional law. Our performance that day earned our team the national title. The real gratification for me, though, was the realization that my performance during that final day of competition had been full of joy. That having a \\'personality\\' had come naturally. Only through ballet could I have discovered the thrill of performance, the satisfaction that comes with discipline and hard work, and the ability to express myself with confidence. Though I am no longer dancing, Mr. Magnus\\'s lessons have remained with me, and will continue to guide me\\\\u2014and I wouldn\\'t have it any other way. \"}, {\"index\": 623, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] My first experience with dance occurred when I was five years old. My mother dropped me off at the recreation center by our house in a pink leotard and tutu for the children\\'s dance class. Since then, dancing had become an integral part of my life. I took dance classes at the center for many years after my first lesson, and at ten years old, I earned a scholarship from the Nevada Ballet Theatre to train pre-professionally there.I moved to Cleveland from Las Vegas when I was twelve, and naturally enrolled in the Cleveland School of the Arts for dance. I knew I wanted to continue my art so the school an obvious choice. In my dance class, I would readily classify myself as the best dancer in the middle school class; I had come from a dancing background and catching choreography easier to me than to them. My teacher gave me a role of a member in the school\\'s dance company the Urban Dance Youth Ensemble. When it came time for casting in pieces, where I thought I would be first-choice for leading roles, I was incredibly wrong. They had technique like I had, but they also had something in their dancing that I lacked: they gave life when they danced.\\'Giving life\\' cannot really be described, only seen and it is different for every dancer. It may be the extra stretch in a reach or a slight lift of the head; these little differences add color that only a true artist can add to their dancing.From the back of the room, I watched these dancers with a lulling head and tried to learn from them. I made it an effort to copy these dancers\\' exact movements with their inflections. Yet, I still looked awkward when dancing, still a petite ballerina thrown into the earthy modern world. I had asked one of these dancers how to dance with the same passion she had. Her advice was \\'Let go. Let go of everything and give into the music and your emotion.\\' At the time, I couldn\\'t entirely grasp the concept of letting go; in ballet, cautious technique makes a good ballet, and the ballerina in me rejected the idea of giving up all of the training that I had.It wasn\\'t until the one day I had a West African class when my mind had finally changed. I was struggling in the class, and the drummer noticed. He told me advice that will stick with me forever: \\'Dance as free as you can.\\' I dropped all of my technique and finally just started to have fun. I may not have looked exactly like an African dancer but I was dancing without any restrictions and didn\\'t care how I looked; it felt right. \"}, {\"index\": 624, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I felt perfectly equipped to deliver coffees. Not much more. As I looked around the conference table at the dozen MBA students, I was pretty sure I was in the wrong place. Two months prior, I had nervously interviewed for a job with a social impact startup. I was offered an internship doing office work in support of the venture\\'s summer MBA program. Somehow, my summer experience became something quite dramatically different. When I arrived in June, I was thrown into the program itself, joining a cohort of MBA students and undergrads from Stanford, Harvard, Wharton and Kellogg. Each program participant was assigned to a nonprofit or social venture and tasked with completing a consulting project over ten weeks from June to August. My assignment was to develop a financial model and monthly report for the CFO of the Doe Fund, a New York City nonprofit that employs ex-cons. My partner for the project was a Wharton MBA student, thirty, and married with two kids. I felt lost. I entered an alternate reality where I was regularly referred to as the \\'fellow,\\' consulted for advice on financial modeling, and asked to present in staff meetings. I became accustomed to conference rooms and security desks and traveling between Midtown and East Harlem as if I belonged in both places. I attended events and happy hours, and I perfected the art of drinking Perrier with dignity. My daily encounters in a variety of professional settings inevitably ended in awkward conversations where I was forced to admit that I was a high school senior, and not\\\\u2014as my coworkers so readily accepted\\\\u2014an elite MBA student.My new routines were a world apart from what I was accustomed to. Asked by the Doe Fund HR executive to reevaluate my teenage wardrobe, I raided my mom\\'s closet, borrowing starched linen knee-length dresses I\\'d never imagined myself in\\\\u2014the antithesis of sexy. Monday through Friday, nine to five, I scheduled meetings, analyzed financial statements, and tried to teach myself the hundreds of things I was presumed to already know. Every Tuesday I traveled with the group of MBAs to a series of fascinating companies around the city, from Bloomberg to Citibank to Warby Parker, and heard from dozens of people working in the social impact space.It was new and exciting and constantly uncomfortable. Growing up in a rather homogenous suburb, I developed a strong predilection for order and familiarity. Suddenly, I was thrown into a world where I had to adjust\\\\u2014and readjust\\\\u2014on an almost hourly basis.So I adjusted. I quietly delighted in being mistaken as older and more experienced, and I began to mold myself into the new role I had assumed. I indulged in that prevalent childhood fantasy of fast-forwarding to being a grown-up, and soon found myself contributing something worthwhile rather than just struggling to keep afloat. My experiences last summer do not fit neatly into my life back home. And that\\'s okay. As I move away from what\\'s familiar and become exposed to new worlds and new challenges, I expect\\\\u2014and hope\\\\u2014that they will not all seamlessly fit together. My summer experience was simultaneously jarring and encouraging. I look forward to finding myself in places and situations, and among people, that expand, distort, conflict, and continually butt heads with what is familiar in surprising and sometimes uncomfortable ways.The product I helped create\\\\u2014a monthly financial report\\\\u2014has real, applicable value. So does every uncomfortable, exciting, terrifying, and sometimes overwhelming experience I had this summer. I\\'m excited for the multitude of similarly unnerving experiences to come. I may have been content delivering coffees. But after this summer, I want to feel more than complacent comfort in my undertakings. The alternatives\\\\u2014variance, a bit of chaos, a world of unexpected challenges\\\\u2014have proven far more rewarding. Because now I feel empowered.  \"}, {\"index\": 625, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] On my 13th birthday, I shattered the most important rule in my family lineage.My inquisitive 7th-grade fingers held the crisp emerald bill against the sunlight. Sure enough, minuscule yellow 100\\'s were freckled around the words, \\'FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE.\\' Earlier that day, my parents had bestowed this seemingly enormous amount of currency upon me. No strings attached.Envisioning my entire future through the eyes of Benjamin Franklin, I decided to pursue the art of making money - business.My career aspirations directly violated the tradition of my ancestry: parampara, an ancient Hindu belief in which disciples are expected to do as their elders do.I am the first child born in the U.S. to a family of Indian physicians. My heart sank whenever an adult would tell another that I was to practice medicine, for never had I revealed my innate fear of trickling crimson.Diving further and further into the dark abyss of isolation, I became increasingly distant from my roots. And as if simply working towards a business career wasn\\'t enough, I entered a new family that would support my ambition: DECA.Seeking haven in an organization designed to prepare emerging leaders and entrepreneurs, I discovered new passions in every situation I faced. The enthusiasm to energize and educate others superseded all other liberating emotions that I felt through DECA.Each step in my DECA journey deepened the crevasse separating myself from my ancestry. My first accolade came when I was the only junior officer selected to lead over 300 DECA members of my school, the most competitively successful in the state.Constantly striving to gain more experience, I decided to run for a state officer position: The Vice President of Northern California DECA, representing over 5,000 members of the state, and in charge of all 2,400 members and 45 schools in the region.My dedication to leadership in the business world would not materialize easily. Deviating away from parampara would be even more challenging. Nevertheless, I set out to defeat eight qualified candidates, all willing to do whatever it would take to secure a plurality of the voters.Succeeding in the election session was the first step.\\'I can show you the world, shining, shimmering, splendid.\\' Why hadn\\'t I come up with the idea to sing Aladdin? My opponent stole the crowd\\'s laughter, and the noise rang in my ears as I slowly felt votes slipping away. Stifling feelings of regret, I remained faithful to my dreams.Stepping onto the stage, I was about to spend the next 120 seconds of my life convincing over 2,300 attendees as to why I should be chosen.Why? I had to earn the authority to break parampara. Simply seeking a business career fell short of my family\\'s expectations. My quest for election had to end in success in order to truly gain independence from my family\\'s expectations.Against all odds, I was elected.No longer did the idea of surgical masks loom. Immediately suiting up in my pinstriped blazer, I jumped head-first into my presidential role. My quest to fulfill my dreams was bolstered with each student that joined my DECA family.My confident handshake replaced thoughts of latex gloves. My prescription became my SWOT Analysis. Never putting brakes on my business vision, I interned at UNCLE Credit Union, whose employees helped me co-found a financial literacy organization in which I taught money management to over 450 students from high school to special education.I became a teacher in a subject considered incompatible with my ancestral standards.Independence dictates that our lives are shaped by personal priorities rather than external constraints. My trial against parampara became a rite of passage for my entrance into adulthood.Flipping over the 100-dollar bill in my hand today, my eyes lock upon the Liberty Bell, jaded in form but glowing in strength. Embracing this unique symbol of independence, I redefine my predecessor\\'s interpretation of success. \"}, {\"index\": 626, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I\\'m not sure if I\\'ve ever had a more uneasy feeling in my stomach than I did as I pulled up to Bryce\\'s house. This feeling wasn\\'t the average butterflies; it felt like butterflies carrying chainsaws. I didn\\'t know what I was about to get myself into. I shouldn\\'t have been so nervous to walk into a friend\\'s house, but I couldn\\'t help it. Once again, my social anxiety had gotten the best of me.\\'Hey, Lilli, come to Bryce\\'s. Everyone\\'s here and they\\'re asking where you are.\\'Lies.\\'I doubt that. I don\\'t want to come.\\'\\'Please? I want to see you!\\'Even though I could barely hear her because of the extraneous music and shouting, Josie sounded so enthusiastic on the phone. It did sound like a fun time, but I really couldn\\'t bring myself to think that I would enjoy myself. I wasn\\'t a big fan of people; I preferred my always-reliable, never-judgmental friends on Netflix. Leaving my house to see people who I didn\\'t talk to often wasn\\'t exactly my favorite thing to do. I\\'ve had a mild form of social anxiety since I began high school, and only a few close friends and some family know about it. It\\'s really gotten in the way of me easily making friends and branching out.After 45 minutes or so of disagreeing with Josie, I finally caved. I mustered up the little confidence I had in my mediocre social skills and I made my way over. I must\\'ve waited outside that house for 20 minutes before I got out of my car, mostly because I thought I was going to puke or implode or cry - or a terribly disturbing combination of the three. Lilli, you are pathetic. Just walk inside, you dummy. You won\\'t die\\\\u2026 hopefully. After talking myself in and out of going inside, I made my decision. I left the unparalleled comfort of my 2008 Town and Country and knocked on the door of a girl\\'s house that I hardly knew. After a few terrifying minutes, nobody answered the door. By this point, I thought Josie was pulling a prank on me. I decided to call her. Apparently, I was supposed to go through the back door. I had spent three minutes envisioning my doom, and all I had to do was go to a different door. Go figure.People were everywhere.I acted as confident as I could as I cautiously staggered inside. I imagine I looked extraordinarily similar to the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz.  I soon spotted some friends and immediately stood by their side. I heard my favorite song playing somewhere, which eased my nerves a bit. Then, something peculiar happened. People I barely knew were not only noticing me, but actually speaking to me too. That was a huge deal for me and frankly, pretty cool. At first, I was incredibly awkward and extremely apprehensive. However, throughout the night, I found myself becoming more and more comfortable around these strangers. I was forming bonds with newfound friends over simple things like having the same types of dogs or the crazy idea that Chipotle should definitely be open later than 10. Was it really this easy for me to make conversation with others and think of interesting things to say? Could I actually enjoy myself with the company of others more than spending time on Netflix?A year ago, my answer would\\'ve been no.  Now, I try to stay optimistic, but I\\'ve learned that social anxiety is a problem with no solution. I crave intimate connections so I can rid myself of it, but my anxiety halts me from making those necessary friendships. I may never be able to get out of the paradox, but thanks to the unlimited help of some incredibly supportive and life-changing friends, the butterflies have put down their chainsaws. \"}, {\"index\": 627, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 628, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] A Magical WorldThe cover is shredded from over a decade of use. The plastic is disintegrating and the binding fails to hold. Yet, under the worn cover are hundreds of pages containing fluorescent oranges and yellows from a collection of Calvin and Hobbes comic strips. The premise of the comics is simple, a six-year-old boy named Calvin and his best friend Hobbes (an anthropomorphic tiger) explore the world around them. When I discovered the comics at age eight, my creative drive underwent a dramatic, positive change. Beneath the colorful cover were hundreds of comic strips ranging from the comedic to the philosophical, all of which became an inspiration to think freely and truly discover my imagination. Most importantly, I was driven to learn more about the world I lived in every day.To Calvin, the universe had no deadlines nor limits. This world without restrictions spoke to my imagination and fueled my innovation as I experienced Calvin\\'s adventures through the untamed wilderness of the backyard and the vast expanse of the driveway. This new perspective changed everything for me. Even the most ordinary of environments could suddenly make for the most extravagant tales. The large hill on my neighborhood street? It would be the platform for wild adventures on my bike. My neighbor\\'s sidewalk? That would be the perfect location for my athletic fantasies. For every laser-eyed velociraptor conjured in the minds of Calvin and Hobbes, I gained the inspiration to craft my own fantastic universes containing flying trains in space. Before Calvin and Hobbes, I had a concerning lack of creativity as activities including drawing and painting sparked little interest in me. Thinking outside the box became second nature after Calvin showed me what was possible. I was no Picasso, but my creativity flourished through writing and images of imaginary lands. At a young age, Calvin and Hobbes opened my eyes to the genuine possibilities if one simply used their imagination.With no mental filter, the willingness to participate in wild antics, and a fearless friend in Hobbes, Calvin had the audacity to question human nature far beyond the range of his young mind. With questions such as, \\'Do you think human nature is good or evil?\\' and, \\'Does anyone ever clean the subconscious?\\', Calvin became a representation of me. I became a child curious enough to question Calvin\\'s ethics, yet innocent enough to giggle at a comic strip containing a boy and his tiger dancing to Beethoven\\'s Symphony No. 9 in pajamas. As I grew older, the watercolors and witty writing stuck with me and fueled my curiosity. In high school, the decision to join Speech and Debate was due to my curiosity from Calvin and Hobbes. In addition, it became an activity to learn about multiple perspectives on modern issues. However, the moral quandaries of today can be clouded by complex evidence given during debates. By asking, \\'What would Calvin say?\\', more intricate thought could be guided by simple moral bases. Calvin and his tiger were always guiding me along with their intriguing insights and fountain of knowledge. He spoke the truth about life in the only way a six-year old could, plainly and simply. Viewing the world through a simplified scope as Calvin did made even the most frightening of situations manageable.Calvin and Hobbes\\' final strip ended with words that perfectly summarized my years of reading the comic. \\'It\\'s a magical world...let\\'s go exploring!\\' With the sadness of the end came a new beginning. By sparking intellectualism through humor, Calvin and Hobbes forever transformed my thinking to be philosophical and creative. There is much to discover, and by making me dream, laugh, and think, the tattered images of a bright cartoon boy and his tiger were able to show me how truly remarkable the world is. Even if the pages tear, Calvin and Hobbes will still live on in my heart, and my actions. \"}, {\"index\": 629, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  In a world of black and white, I am a strange instance in which the universe created gray. Picture the perfect blank canvas, a town unstained by shades of crime. Summer vacations are synonymous with weeks spent abroad traipsing through cobblestone alleys in Barcelona or fine art-meets-fine dining by the Louvre. Bat mitzvahs, sweet sixteens, and quince\\\\u00f1eras are rites of passage, not into religion, maturity, or culture, but into the world of lavish spending.  As a minority and the middle child of three to a homemaker mother and a pastor father, on the surface, class disparity was more than evident. However, I never approached these differences with inhibition. All around me, I saw motivation, a clear picture of success. To get there, I had to get creative and hustle. All my upscale surrounding considered, it\\'s no wonder that, by high school, I was enamored with the fashion industry. Far from having a wardrobe to match, I discovered upscale thrift stores and online secondhand shops that I could sell clothing to. I constantly contemplated profit margins; every clothing purchase was treated like an investment. Although it began as a means for me to keep up appearances, the idea of being able to transform myself externally to evolve along with my inward qualities was nothing short of epiphany. Over two years ago, I created a blog called Posh and Circumstance, which I used as a platform to boast my style steals, posting about the predicted trends and latest events in fashion. The site became my safe space\\\\u2014I was sheltered from the \\'poseur\\'-criticisms of my elite surroundings and the mediocre expectations of those with a similar socioeconomic standing. This avenue towards complete verity with an impartial audience empowered me to create exciting and inspired content, and, before I knew it, a small following of a few hundred fans sparked the net and turned into an audience of thousands. My ability to establish myself early on in the industry opened new channels of opportunity beyond what I had ever imagined possible. Using my site as a portfolio of sorts, as just a junior in high school, despite competing against dozens of college-aged applicants, I snagged a public relations and social media internship at Marchesa, one of the most acclaimed couture houses in New York. Having built stellar relations with my school administrators, I was able to begin my three month internship in early June, traveling to the city three days a week while balancing end-of-year schoolwork stress and finals. During my time there, the company saw an average of 20% growth across all their major social media platforms, and, in return, I received invaluable experience and made connections to last a lifetime. It was during a long city commute that I first realized the entrepreneurial opportunity that existed right in my own community. Considering the affluent and tech-savvy demographic, businesses in the area were failing to maximize social media reach by incorporating town culture and integrating store events. My first client: a brand new Apple-licensed technology store looking to start strong, especially among iOS-obsessed students. As someone who seeks to study computer science as well as media, the nature of this client company is one that both allows me to utilize my talents and pushes me to pursue interests beyond communications as a STEM major. Taking all I learned over the summer and my experience growing up in the community as a millennial, I have created a fresh new take on PR consulting and social media maintenance for local businesses. For me, this marks more than the start of a hobby turned career. It signifies the end of long hours at my part time job to help pay family costs. It shows that success is blind to circumstance. It proves that from shades of gray, I have what it takes to create color. \"}, {\"index\": 630, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] To many people I may simply be just another student, another average teenager. But my life is so much more diverse than most might assume, and its primarily because of my background, because the backdrop of my life is a million cultures and stories converging together.This includes my home, created from the unlikely union of two contrasting stories. A man who was born in a small, impoverished village, grew up in South Central, quit school by the eighth grade, joined a gang, and went to jail happened to marry my mother; a petite white woman from a tumultuous middle class family ravaged by mental illness. My mom never pursued a degree, but developed a dedicated love of learning. With these seeming opposites as parents, I have been given the opportunity to inquire about backgrounds I can barely fathom. I have asked my father what it\\'s like to be in jail, to be shot, to live with an abusive father in curious disbelief. Meanwhile, from my mother I learned of different, emotional hardships, yet also the wonders of reading, wit, and the importance of speaking my mind and knowing my value, especially as a woman. Yet the scenery behind my life isn\\'t just my home. The entire world also influences my background. Together, my group of friends is a patchwork representation of various nations and cultures. Hailing immediately or indirectly from India, the Middle East, China, Fiji, Russia, Cameroon, Ethiopia, and more. With each friend is an opportunity to ask questions; to learn about the intricacies of the Qur\\'an, how to speak Farsi or Tamil, the steps of the bharatanatyam dance, how to cook pho, and more.These factors alone set my life apart from many others, yet still one of the most influential pieces of my background is my school. While my neighborhood consists almost completely of average, white, middle class families, our local school is seventy four percent African American and has developed a reputation as a result. And this ironic juxtaposition has instilled in me not only an appreciation and admiration of a culture different from my own, but also a stubborn resolve to prove that this condescended upon and discriminated against school is just as capable of producing smart, hard working, and successful students, as the other schools my community has fled to.This is my background. It is colorful, it is unique, and it is complex. On paper, I could be any stereotypical nerd in the United States. But my life is so much more than a few grades and test scores. I am the daughter of a Mexican immigrant, the granddaughter of a bipolar woman, the child of a former gangbanger, the friend of first generation Americans with families from around the world. I am a Mexican-American student at an African American dominated school, I am a teenager who loves to read, I am a biracial woman, and soon I will be a first generation college student. I felt the need to tell my story because I believe anyone who will make a decision that could very well affect my entire future must understand who I am. These qualities and aspects of my life that I chose to explain were not just simple facts that I have brown hair and eyes, these are meaningful qualities about the world I come from, and the background that has made me who I am. In applying to college I realized that my life was not punctuated by a single event, or a single person, or a single decision, but is instead a synergistic product of my distinctive background, and I wouldn\\'t change it for the world. \"}, {\"index\": 631, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I stared at my polished railing as the photons danced in the humid air allowing me to perceive reality. I could taste salt water in my crimson lips as I stared into what I thought was oblivion. I snapped out of my depressive trance and wiped away my tears. I couldn\\'t be weak, not now. Moving back to Bangladesh was, in the eyes of a 12 year old, a curse. Leaving a first world country for a third world country did not make sense to my naive mind but later I understood my parent\\'s point of view. The living expense in New York forced my parents make the massive change. Living expenses in Bangladesh were a lot less comparatively but I couldn\\'t grasp my parent\\'s motives, being selfish of only my desires to stay in a country where I grew in age but much less as a person. My first day there, I could see destitute people. Poverty filled the roads and noxious gasses slapped my face with bitter ridicule but little did I know this land would be the place where I would realize my potential and fall in love with the pursuit of knowledge.My first day of school was a complete revelation. People marveled at the presence of an American and expected me to be some sort of precocious child. However, as the classes proceeded, they saw me as an average boy from a not-so-average place. The curriculum was extremely different from American curriculum and was very abstruse. From America\\'s form of education of understanding a concept, I had to conform to a Bangladeshi standard of education on intense memorization and building experience from memory. Months passed and with the completely different curriculum, I was at the bottom of my class, feeling degraded and worthless. I began to form a bubble and separate myself from most of the school and that is when I instilled a spark within me to truly value knowledge. I began studying nonstop and by my side was a mentor as intuitive as Socrates, my cousin. Arif had consistently tutored me for hours a day with tenacity. For every pen stroke I wrote, every x value I had solved for, and every little piece of knowledge I stored in my head, I began to see a light within my secluded cocoon. Inheriting his perseverance and brilliant intellect, I began to see exponential increase in my grades. From time to time, my motivation dipped but there was there was no stronger driving force than my parents, my mother constantly telling me before I went to bed that hard work will always bring well-earned joy, or when my father and I would occasionally Skype, how he told me he struggles to make our family content only for us to never live the same life he did. My parents saw me as their only hope, their escape from an unfulfilled life. They expected greatness from me as I would be the first from my family to attend college and that pushed me beyond limits that were never fathomable. From the many nights I stood on my balcony contemplating how lonely I was, I began imagining what I could achieve with this new-found desire for education, what new doors awaited to be opened. After everything I have been through, I truly would not have understood the feeling of success if I hadn\\'t failed at first. For my whole life, I had always needed a helping hand but now the roles have switched and I soon aspire to become the helping hand for others. After having experienced life in my impoverished country, I dream of one day going back and helping those who need it. Doing that would require power and there is no power more sufficient than knowledge. With knowledge within me, I can easily take the next step without fearing what is to come. \"}, {\"index\": 632, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Struggle, page 36My dad opened his bag. I didn\\'t know what to expect. Thick? Thin? Colored? Black and white? As he held it in his hand, my eyes glistened. I could smell it. I could perceive its surface. This was the day I got my first issue of TIME magazine. With a sky-blue background and unknown English words, all framed by the distinctive red border, that April 2, issue of TIME magazine appeared as a magic object, coming from far away.I recall taking it, bursting with excitement, rushing into my room, sitting at my desk and \\\\u2013 after taking a deep breath - opening the first page, and immersing myself in that unexplored muddle of knowledge. While to most readers TIME magazine may be a rather commonplace and insignificant object, to me it was a symbol. My first magazine in English. My dad runs a newsstand, and for as long as I can remember, newspapers and magazines have been everywhere in my room, in my house, in my life. So ubiquitous that the first thing I would do when travelling abroad would be to look for a newsstand. My collection included French and German newspapers, British and Hungarian magazines but nothing from the other side of the ocean. To me, a na\\\\u00efve pre-teen with an insatiable curiosity and thirst for knowledge, TIME magazine was a revelation.  Living in a tiny town in foggy northern Italy, reading had always been a way of exploring new worlds, discovering the unknown, learning about the outside. At the time, I did not have internet access at home. I had to rely on magazines and newspapers.Reading TIME magazine has been a key element in shaping my interests, horizons, and ambitions. The first word I learned by reading TIME magazine was \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018struggle\\', April 2, page 36, in an article discussing Sarkozy. Reading TIME has been a struggle: when I started reading it, my English vocabulary was very limited. I had to look up almost every word. As weeks passed, a pile of copy paper sheets on my desk grew taller and taller, each one covered with handwritten words. Two columns: English and Italian. Sometimes I wanted to give up, to postpone learning those words and finally go to sleep. However, every time, right before putting the pen down, I decided I was not going to give up. Every time, I persevered.  As months passed and issues of TIME kept flowing into my room, I would stay up at night, reading those analyses, those op-eds, and those reviews that were so new and intriguing to me. At the time, I had just started my news blog, and I would spend entire days trying to read American websites, hoping to find something to write about (something that a big shot major media company would not have time to cover). Well, I was wrong, and I spent quite a few sleepless nights trying to catch up with some of the largest news websites around. I quickly decided that by reading TIME magazine, and by learning to write like TIME magazine, I could have easily outpaced my Italian competitors and finally break my personal record of 10,000 visitors. Well, I was wrong again, but I quickly realized that spending countless days immersed in that red border had sparked something in me. As months passed, what would keep me up at night was no longer the transformative power of the new iPad, or why a Retina display was the next big thing. It was the crisis of the US auto industry, the Arab Spring, and disposing of nuclear waste. The same issues that I would find myself debating at the European Youth Parliament and at Model UN conferences in the next years. TIME magazine has been more than an interesting read, and now every time my dad comes home with his bag, I can\\'t help thinking about what\\'s inside. \"}, {\"index\": 633, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I am not of this earth.

Every time, the transition between each chord became a little quicker; the sound rang out a little more clearly. It was final exam week of the first semester of my freshman year, and I was trying to take a mental break from studying. By winter break though, these simple chords came together as I learned to play my first songs. I looked up how-to-play videos on YouTube, bought different chord books, and practiced every day. I doubled, tripled, and then quadrupled the amount of chords and songs I knew.Music has always been a part of my life, thanks to my dad. He too learned to play the guitar when he was in high school and eventually made a career of it, becoming the Director of Worship Arts at our church. His constant playing inspired a love of music in me from an early age. When I was two years old, I would rock out with my camera tripod \\'microphone\\' and sing some of my favorite songs that my dad would play. I would hilariously belt out slightly modified lyrics that even made my usually stone-faced uncle laugh until there were tears in his eyes. As a kindergartener, I enjoyed a series of after-school percussion lessons. I was drawn to the simple math embedded in the beat that turned the complicated paradiddles and triplet exercises into a game. In middle school, I discovered GarageBand on my school computer. During my free time, I would try to compose different songs using the app (despite my complete lack of knowledge of music theory). I would place notes in a sequence until they came together in a way that I liked, even if it meant spending hours to create twenty seconds of actual music. There was something special about taking tones that everyone has access to and combining them to make my own. Admittedly, it wasn\\'t amazing music, but it was unique to me. It was my new invention.Teaching myself how to play the guitar was merely an extension of my love of creating music. It\\'s something that will always be a part of me. I love it not only because it is a relaxing creative outlet, but because it allows my brain to work in the way it does best. It exercises my problem-solving skills as I work to put notes together to form the perfect sound. It\\'s my opportunity to be inventive and expressive outside of other intellectual pursuits. It\\'s engaging, fun, and a distinct part of who I am.I\\'m not skilled enough to turn this passion into a career quite yet. That would require more practice and dedication, which I\\'m certainly not opposed to. I do, however, believe that my career will allow me to put these same skills to use. Somewhere I can problem-solve, be creative, be hands-on and use technical skills just like I do when I\\'m playing guitar or creating new music. Perhaps I\\'ll be in a laboratory, conducting important research or developing new chemical processes, troubleshooting different problems and coming up with new solutions. Wherever I\\'ll be, I\\'ll always have the same love of music, rocking out on the guitar for those much-needed mental breaks whenever I can! \"}, {\"index\": 636, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] If you ask anyone at my school where I usually spend my time, the answer is likely to be \\'the physics laboratory\\'. I usually spend more time in the lab than anywhere else, including my home. I get there very early, happily trading my bed for those wooden benches and the blackboard, and I only leave when it\\'s closing. It\\'s the place I feel most comfortable in, because my friends and I not only study there; we form a real \\'physics lab community\\'.When I first walked into the physics lab, I immediately felt I belonged there. I had just moved away and started living alone in order to pursue a better education, and I was nervous about fitting in at school. Leaving home had been exciting, but the idea of being alone at a place I didn\\'t fit was terrifying. This was getting me anxious. However, when I first entered the laboratory and saw some people discussing exercises on the blackboard and others playing with the static sphere, I had to struggle to avoid throwing my backpack on the floor and running to join them. At that moment, my concern about fitting in was vanished.Eventually, I started going there almost every day. The more time I spent in the lab, the more I enjoyed its little details. Every day before classes I went there and took a deep breath; I loved the smell of the place, and that was necessary for my day to start well. At lunch, some people joined for chatting and playing with the experiments. Once we grabbed mirrors and a laser, turned off the lights, went to different corners of the lab and tried to form a light path with the mirrors. There were countless times when the laser ended up in someone\\'s face and we laughed so much because the light just seemed to escape from us.For me, the most amazing thing in our lab community was the sharing of knowledge. Since there were people from different subjects and phases in the several science Olympiads, a person starting some Olympiad, for example, could be advised by people that had competed in the international Olympiad, whether he or she was trying the physics Olympiad or the biology one. This helped me define which Olympiad I\\'d focus on, because I could see the path I\\'d have to walk on each of them and decide where I fit better.Even after defining my focus, I could still have insights on other sciences, since the lab was a multidisciplinary place. I could hear people discussing math, chemistry, or physics, just by moving to different corners of the lab. Because of that, I was never lost in the laboratory. It was amazing to be advised by someone and be able to share my own knowledge with others. Also, as I was in a place where people understood many different sciences, I could see distinct approaches for the same phenomenon. I could, therefore, understand that I couldn\\'t delimit science into only one subject; I had to look at the whole panorama, because it is an interdisciplinary concept. I believe this approach was essential for me to succeed in scientific Olympiads.Nowadays, I keep coming to the laboratory; it is still my home. My best friends and I are now seniors, and incredibly, we were all selected to different international Olympiads this year. I feel that it was only possible because we were actually part of this lab community, which gave us the basis and support for us to work and achieve our goals. I see a new generation coming to the lab and I am eager to help and mentor them to succeed as I did, and to show them that they are not just studying with other people, but that they are part of something bigger. They are now part of the \\'physics lab community\\'. \"}, {\"index\": 637, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Zzzzt! The sensor buzzed as I scanned my badge. The door opened, and I stood in the lobby of the Swiss Private Bank, my employer for the next three years. I looked around wide-eyed at marbled ceilings and businessmen in high-end suits greeting their clients. \\'So this will become my world?\\' I skeptically asked myself. At fifteen years old, I felt so young to be doing something like this.Initially, it wasn\\'t easy. Sometimes, I\\'d forget my badge and abashedly ask security to let me in. After arduously proving that I did work at the bank, I\\'d finally be allowed inside. Things were similar on the job: I constantly had to prove myself to be taken seriously. By taking initiative to learn at every opportunity, I acquainted myself well in the increasingly familiar world of banking, once explaining a recent money-laundering bill to the office even before my boss had heard of it. As I immersed myself in educating myself about finance, I steadily rose in my co-workers\\' estimation.Zzzzt. Beeep! Six months into my apprenticeship, my badge wouldn\\'t open the door. Puzzled at first, I finally remembered that my probation period had ended and it was time to change departments. I got a new badge, new coworkers, and new challenges. This team was larger and more diverse than my first one: twenty new faces, ten different nationalities, and everybody at least double my age. With only six months before my next department change, I knew I had no time to waste in getting to know my colleagues and finding my place among them. By the second week, I was already so settled in that my colleagues asked for my advice about their teenage children. The interpersonal skills from this stage of my apprenticeship were invaluable as I moved on to the next one.Zzzzt! Six months later, prepared with an updated badge, I entered my new department. One of the first things I learned was my new boss\\'s nickname: \\'Shrill Phil.\\' Although I reported to a mentor rather than directly to Phil, if I hadn\\'t finished all my work by the end of the day, not only I but also my mentor would be screamed at. My conscientiousness would not let this happen. I quickly developed a sense of urgency toward my work, becoming more precise and efficient than ever before.From the halfway point of my apprenticeship, I had direct contact with clients. My new responsibilities used all the skills from the first half of my time at the Swiss Private Bank: my knowledge of finance, interpersonal skills, and efficiency. For instance, I was shown only once how the money exchange machine worked; after that, I was responsible for assisting clients directly. To maintain high standards in this environment, I often had to work overtime, but I knew this was necessary in order to continue building my skills and develop comfort and confidence in my place of work.Towards the end of my apprenticeship, I noticed that my badge had become superfluous and my familiar face was enough to open doors. I\\'d moved on from learning the basics and begun making professional milestones, such as accompanying managing directors on client visits.Those three years shaped me into who I am today. In the probation stage, I learned the importance of knowledge and genuine interest. I gained unparalleled interpersonal skills in my second department, and as I continued I developed the ability to take criticism and work with conscientiousness. At the beginning of my apprenticeship, I needed my badge to open the door to an unfamiliar world, but today, I don\\'t need a badge anymore; I don\\'t need to be shown how to advance toward my goals. My drive and experience are enough to let me smoothly step through any door and move toward my future. \"}, {\"index\": 638, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The drone hit the tree at full speed, sending a cascade of shimmering leaves dancing downward. A moment later, the leaves were joined by falling rotors and engines, which hit the ground with a deafening thump. I stared at the carnage, stunned by what I\\'d just done. A piercing crack broke my daze as the drone, camera, and a tree limb came crashing down. This was not the first tree I\\'d trimmed today.I learned from my grandfather that precision matters. I watched him live that philosophy, investing his soul into his projects and passions. He had to focus on the details to do what he loved.Docking spacecraft at thousands of miles per hour takes precision. Creating an airtight seal between two capsules built by different countries with different docking systems seems impossible to me. But to my grandfather, the Apollo-Soyuz mission was a reminder that details could be the difference between life and death.He told the story many times. How he helped NASA design a special module to couple the American and Russian craft. How the weight of each bolt had to be calculated and the breath of each astronaut had to be considered.I listened in awe, but when he reached the end, I tuned out the lesson he\\'d attach to the tale: \\'\\\\u2026And that\\'s why you should always take care and pay attention to the details.\\' I liked to move quickly, flitting from one thing to the next, never getting more than halfway through a project. We would stroll through the forest where he stooped to inspect each fungus and fallen tree. I preferred to run through the woods.When I turned twelve, my grandfather bought me a bonsai tree with tiny tear-drop leaves. \\'Bonsai is an art,\\' my grandfather explained. \\'It takes patience and mindfulness to nurture a tree and expose its essence.\\' He showed me how to clip the branches, mist the moss growing by the base, and water the tree with droplets of water. It took him a solid hour to complete the ritual.I tried to trim the tiny tree each week. Time passed, and the hours I spent caring for the bonsai diminished. High school began, and I started to follow in my grandfather\\'s footsteps. I loved the feeling of diving into a project, of designing and building with my own hands. By the time I was in eleventh grade, I was busy with schoolwork and engineering projects. Still, there were details of which I was not mindful. I barely watered the bonsai once-a-week.This summer, I was an engineering intern. My project was to program a drone to take images that I could stitch into a 3D map. I was entrusted with a thousand dollar drone on my first day. It wasn\\'t working, so I took it home to replace the engines. Though not the same as a billion dollar spacecraft, I was proud of the responsibility.I rewired and repaired the drone that evening. The next morning, I woke and hastily lopped off a branch that seemed to be growing too big on my bonsai. I confidently powered up the drone at work, intending to test it in a field. What I didn\\'t check during my repairs was whether the GPS had been calibrated. Instants after takeoff, the drone shot toward 0\\\\u00b0 latitude, 0\\\\u00b0 longitude. Unfortunately, a tree stood between it and the western coast of Africa.The carnage was devastating. How could I face my colleagues after such a careless mistake? My grandfather\\'s words suddenly resurfaced in my mind: \\'Take care\\\\u2026\\'. These were the consequences when I acted rashly.I have become more conscientious. I clip, mist and water my bonsai each morning. Its wrinkled bark reminds me of my grandfather. Next to it, I\\'ve mounted the wrecked body of the drone, a crumpled testament to the particulars, the details, and the importance of being mindful. \"}, {\"index\": 639, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Critical SplashSince I was ten, I\\'ve been going to CampNameEditedOut every summer. As a kid, it was an amazing place to be. Nestled in the Blue Ridge mountains, surrounded by Pisgah Forest, it\\'s everything I love about my home state: good food, friendly people, and beautiful scenery. Like most campers, I was devastated at age 14 when it was my final summer as a camper. But after leaving camp, I had time to discover myself and my passions outside of my summer home: I went to Costa Rica and Peru and became interested in international development; I attended the Student Diversity Leadership Conference and found a deep passion for social justice; and I navigated high school without my best friend and became independent of a clique for the first time. So when I drove back up the windy gravel camp road two years later, I was a different person with a different role at camp. I was now a Staff-In-Training, responsible for a cabin, kitchen duties, and several activities. Of course, I had no idea how to do any of that. I\\'d never operated an industrial dishwasher. I\\'d never bridled, saddled, and led a horse. I\\'d never instructed children in canoeing, or dealt with homesickness, or even held a job. I\\'d never thought of myself as an adult.The first few weeks, I had the wrong mentality. I thought of myself as a camper, and, lacking confidence, I floundered helplessly at mucking stalls and setting tables for 320 people. I bonded with my fellow SITs, but I was too shy to approach older staff members. I was different from my fourteen-year-old self, but I was clearly still a child.But then, I was paired with a mildly autistic girl who had a crippling fear of the lake. Unluckily for both of us, that was the day we were supposed to practice jumping out of the canoes without tipping them. Obviously, she didn\\'t want to do that, so I went first. Once I was in the lake, she wouldn\\'t hop out, so I attempted to get back in. To do so, I needed her to lean away from me and towards the water. Leery of getting too close, she pulled back at the last second, and we both fell into the lake.  Immediately, she began panicking, flailing, and splashing around. Frantically, I called out to my boss, Kristin, but she was on the other side of the lake, chasing two wayward boys. I looked around for another adult, but then it hit me: I was the adult. I took a deep breath and made my decision. \\'Hold on to the side, Sarah,\\' I said. Then, I pulled the canoe to shore. This was not an epic rescue. Sarah had a life jacket on the whole time and calmed down quickly once we got to shore. I, on the other hand, was shaken, ashamed of having forced a camper to do something she was uncomfortable with. I think I cried in the staff lounge on my best friend\\'s shoulder. It was a stressful moment, and for the following day all I felt was bad.  But a year and a half later, I realize that that was the first moment I acted as an adult. Those scary four minutes transformed me into a grown-up. A child was entirely dependent on me and my decision, and I acted. Since that canoe lesson, I\\'ve had the self-assurance to teach an ESL class to adults, to call constituents as an intern for a mayoral campaign, and to lead a club. As a staff member I learned to be patient with children and coworkers, to keep a sunny attitude when things go awry, to handle the responsibilities of a job, and so much more. CampNameEditedOut, the place I loved as a child, taught me how to be an adult. \"}, {\"index\": 640, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Elementary school kickball used to suck. I would wait forever to hear my name called, but it would always come too late. Dead last. Because of fate, I received a special gift, Cerebral Palsy. Life has never been easy, but this \\'fault\\' ended up being my greatest blessing; without it I would never become the creative, hard working person I am today.It was early spring, immediately after testing with the neurologist, he walked into the waiting room with a clipboard and bad news.I told him about my dreams to fight back, about how I would never limit myself. The doctor smirked. \\'It\\'s going to be difficult to reach those goals\\' he told me. A smile swept across my face. I told him life could bring everything I dreamed of and perhaps more.Summer came soon after; time had come for me to start swim team. I had lofty standards; swimming butterfly came before any other goal. I wanted to perfect stroke technique, but moving my arms simultaneously was nearly impossible. I needed to look majestic. I had to be the strongest. I had to swim butterfly.My goal changed; I wanted to swim year round. Begging filled my parents\\' house for weeks. Eventually, my mother finally gave in. That year coaches saw me push through cold water early in the morning with more strength than possible- every day, every practice. Swimming became easier, but not easy enough. In order to achieve my goal, I needed a new strategy.The journey continued to the library in search of information. My daily library checkout included books on teaching swimming, cross training, and perfecting athletic technique. Eventually, one of the books had an answer. I started wearing weights on one side of my body. Those weights went everywhere, whether I was sitting in class learning about multiplication, working out in practice, or even eating breakfast.Weeks later at 9:00 P.M, my body weights smacked the floor. I felt different. For the first time, I felt in control. Next time I swam my arms moved perfectly in synch. The swim looked perfect. And it felt perfect.Excitement trembled through my body. Friends would finally hear how slick drifting through water felt, and I would tell them all about the power of swimming. But my disorder still haunted me. My lips would get stuck in place, and any coherent thought ended. My mouth got caught in a stutter.Many doctors wanted to help, but speech therapy was torture. I couldn\\'t stand driving after school to get my lips touched by old ladies. It bored me to death. I searched for speech therapy techniques. Only one fit high standards of efficiency and fun. I made flash cards using the best franchise ever: Pok\\\\u00e9mon.Each card had a poorly drawn picture of a character. Seeing those colorful images prompted me to ramble on about its typing, moves, and how animators made them seem tough. The more time without stuttering, the more points earned. I slowly went from being able to say a few words about Pok\\\\u00e9mon, to ranting, and finally to speaking whole sentences with few stutters. From then on therapy meant fun, no cold fingers on frigid lips, and no one harassing me. Speech teachers praised the Pok\\\\u00e9mon method. From then on, every session involved those cards.As I improve myself, my personality grows, I become more confident and sociable. After all the amazing people who have helped me, I want to find a way to help others by teaching. I no longer do entire group science projects by myself, but instead try to improve the group and lead us to a science fair victory. Now as a top pick in kickball, I ensure everyone is used, because everyone has strengths. \"}, {\"index\": 641, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] You probably speak a different language at home cause your accent is still so strong\\', my driving instructor casually said. We\\'d been talking about his other job while stranded in traffic, waiting for cars to slowly inch forward so I could get home. I hadn\\'t expected such a statement, yet I couldn\\'t justify the shock I was feeling, as I realized he\\'d said nothing wrong. All my friends comment on my accent when I first meet them, but after knowing me for so long, it\\'s almost never mentioned. Now here was a person I barely knew, noting that I still had an accent, after living in America for fifteen years.        When I was in Kindergarten, I was placed in ESL. I knew English, learning from many sources, like Saturday morning cartoons, since I moved to America. However, my teacher had found my grammar and accent such a problem that she placed me in the program. Even in class, my teacher would never let me go past the basic reading levels, saying I needed to work on reading out loud properly. I avidly started reading more books, and series like Harry Potter and Goosebumps have followed me since elementary school. I\\'ve progressed from ESL to getting a 5 on the AP Language exam, but my accent hasn\\'t changed.  I visit India every couple of years, as the majority of my extended family lives there. They have a fascination with America, and often refer to me as \\'Americanized\\'. When I try to talk to them in our native language, Telugu, they tell me to speak in English, as they believe my \\'English accent\\' to be the best they\\'ve heard, and because they couldn\\'t fully understand my weird mix of English and Telugu. The difference in perception was confusing to me initially, but over the years I saw the validity of my relatives\\' statements. For example, they would ask me to repeat words like \\'water\\', due to the different pronunciation from the British English they had learned in school. My friends too would ask me to say words like \\'food\\', which I apparently pronounced \\'fud\\' in the past; it\\'s now an inside joke between my friends and me. Experience with issues like these has helped me learn to accept my accent more than I had in the past.         When I went to India in fifth grade, my mom had a necklace made with a locket of the Hindu god Ganesha, which I\\'ve worn since that day. I adjust the necklace throughout the day, and while a few people do see and mention it, it usually stays unnoticed beneath my shirt. However, the necklace provides me a sense of reassurance, as I know it will be there throughout all my experiences, both old and new. It acts as a constant tangible presence of my culture and background. Like my necklace, my accent, ever present in my life, positively reminds me of my heritage. My accent is more than a physical attribute of mine; it remains an indicator of my background. A background that is highlighted by my family\\'s excitement to see the newest Bollywood film, often traveling nearly an hour to find a theater that shows it, or the anticipation of Indian holidays for the delicious ethnic sweets my mom makes.         I think that I\\'ve grown and matured quite a lot from when my driving instructor mentioned my accent to me at sixteen, as that event caused me to reflect on my accent. I don\\'t see it as an immediate negative anymore, but rather a defining feature of me and from where I come. When someone mentions my accent now, I don\\'t feel disdain about sounding different, but rather elation, for my accent reminds me of my background, my history. A heritage that has helped to shape and develop me into the person I am today, staying with me through every word I say.  \"}, {\"index\": 642, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea.

Please describe the factors and challenges that have most shaped your personal life and aspirations. How have these factors helped you to grow?  Before my mother\\'s unemployment, I lived the stereotypical life of an adolescent in suburban Las Vegas. Dad was off in San Francisco doing who-knows-what, Mom worked most days out of the week at Wal Mart pharmacy, and Jane, my older sister, took the responsibility of taking care of me at home. Even before Dad left, I was very tightly sheltered and protected. I never walked home alone, I never went to sleep in an empty house, and I never woke up without a warm meal waiting for me downstairs. I\\'ll admit it: I was spoiled. I got most everything I wanted, absolutely everything I needed, and, looking back now, I never worked for any of it. I relied on the support of others for my livelihood and security, and frankly, I was not at all prepared for the financial and familial shift coming for me in my high school years.         Fresh out of sophomore year, I hugged Mom goodbye as she departed for her new temporary home, three-hundred miles, five hours from home, for a contract job in Buckeye, Arizona. With desperation and a depleted retirement fund, Mom was staying with a friend in Buckeye for free while she was working, for we couldn\\'t afford to move out there on our own. I was terrified and inconsolably upset, but slightly distracted by a strong curiosity of what my new unrestricted life would offer me. In August 2013, two months after Mom\\'s departure, Jane left to return to college at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, yet another five hours elsewhere from home. I stayed in Las Vegas in order to complete my program of study at school. During this time, I managed to tutor kids at my school to help with extraneous expenses while taking up women\\'s lacrosse, maintaining my academic merits, and experimenting with the underground social scene of Summerlin, Nevada.          There were many aspects of teenage life I explored during my time alone. I remained an active and dedicated student, although I did catch myself cutting corners here and there, as my attendance record reflects. Academically, I\\'ve never been one to struggle, as core subjects have always seemed to come to me effortlessly. At home, whichever \\'home\\' it was (I was moved several times during my mother\\'s leave), I kept myself scheduled, punctual, studied, fed, and decent. But after a while, I revisited the curiosity toward this newfound freedom and subjected my sociality to be probed, molded, and unearthed. I dove into several different realms of Las Vegas youth, some factions more respectable than others, but from knowing all of these people I began to know myself. I studied with the \\'goody-goodies,\\' with whom I took myself too seriously and forgot that I was still only sixteen. I learned from \\'art freak hipsters\\' that there are no constraints for creativity, especially public perspective and conformative oppression. I ran alongside great athletes, who showed me that there is no room for mediocrity in a competitive world. But mostly, I partied with the \\'junkies,\\' who broke my boundaries between excitement and destruction, innocence and experience. I indulged in lazy mornings and late nights. I slowly digressed, neglecting the responsibilities I had made for myself prior. And after a while, I grew tired, angsty, and utterly unhappy with the direction in which I was headed.         It took a lot for me to accept missing out on the next adventure and new crazy trends, for I found an addicting element in that exhilaration and uncertainty. The hardest part about returning to my best life was letting go of the friends I made during my experimental months. These people showed me every side of myself, every possible outcome. I\\'ve embraced some pieces picked up along the way; other pieces have been justly discarded.         I\\'m still growing out of those surreal, turbulent, wild two years. I have changed and developed so much about my ambitions, interests, passions, and moral views during Mom\\'s absence. I became comfortable with being alone, which before had never even crossed my mind. Now reunited with my mom, but still with a burning sense of independence, I look forward to the new obstacles life may throw at me. How much of myself is still unvisited? How many cultures have I not yet experienced? How much of myself will remain in the near future? I hope to answer these questions wherever I end up next fall, surrounded by other maverick floaters of social castes, who seek intrinsic growth and realization, who understand that one is not defined by how they grew up or who they grew up with, but rather by who they found in themselves during the inevitable turmoil encountered in this serendipitous life.  \"}, {\"index\": 644, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'You\\'re pretty white for a black guy\\'. Throughout my life, I have constantly heard the same six words from many of the people with whom I have come in contact. At first, this statement and other jokes my friends made at my inability to conform to the stereotypes of African-Americans perpetuated by the media and popular culture did not phase me. I laughed along with them without realizing that these jokes were being made at my expense. However, as I grew older I began to realize that this phrase and others like it were not just isolated events, but part of a larger trend not only experienced by myself, but by others in my community. Growing up as an African-American in mostly white suburban communities and attending private schools where the majority of my classmates have been white has created many unique situations that have shaped how I see the world today. In elementary, the questions and jokes my friends would make were fairly innocuous. I was fine with people asking to touch my hair and the subsequent comparisons of it to whatever animal they felt was the softest (apparently sheep\\'s wool and my hair are the softest substances known to man). And when one of my classmates covered their hands in black paint and told me that they were almost the same color as me (which was grossly inaccurate and also very hilarious at the time), I saw the humor in this situation, and did not think much of it. However as we matured, my friends\\' innocent questions became something much more malicious.  I quickly grew tired of people asking me if I knew who my father was, even though he had been to my class multiple times over the course of the year. Many people would say things to me like, \\'You don\\'t act black,\\' or, \\'You\\'re not ghetto enough to be black.\\' I never thought deeply about the implications of these statements, until someone I barely knew attempted to invalidate my opinion on an issue regarding African-American people by saying, \\'You really aren\\'t allowed to have an opinion on this issue, because you\\'re not technically black.\\' Everyone looked at me for a moment. I was both stunned and disgusted at the fact that he felt that he could say that to me, and the fact that no one else felt the same way I did. In that moment I realized that I was no longer going to allow people to define me based on archaic, inaccurate stereotypes that I had allowed to influence my actions, emotions, and how I expressed myself for so long.  I took this encounter with my classmates and my newfound self confidence, and set out to change how my peers view race and identity within my school. Together with several of my classmates, I founded the diversity club, which seeks to bring together individuals of different backgrounds and explore what our identities mean to us as individuals as well as how we relate to others. At our first few meetings, it was difficult for everyone to relate to each other and to share their stories and the facets of their culture which they were most proud of; but as time went on we became more comfortable explaining certain traditions, discussing the issues central to our identities, and formulating ways to bring greater awareness to our school about what it means to be a minority in America today. Before, when I was confronted with the racist attitude of a classmate, I was content with excusing the dog-whistle racism barely hidden behind their jokes and comments. However, creating the diversity club with my classmates has given myself and others in my position, a platform from which we can express our opinions on certain issues, and work towards making our school a more inclusive environment.  \"}, {\"index\": 645, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Father broke the deafening silence. I\\'d been preparing for this all my life. \\'Why?\\' he asked with intimidating calm. I\\'d always been an obedient church-goer. Every Sunday morning, I would head out to church with my family, returning home in the afternoon, despising everything for the rest of the day. I don\\'t share my father\\'s religious views; I\\'m an atheist. Yet until last year, I kept my atheism secret because I felt like I was in a maze with no exit. How do you tell your father that you\\'re choosing damnation over eternal life? You do so, as I discovered, measuredly, on a Wednesday, in the living room. I answered him: \\'I can\\'t unquestionably devote my life to something I\\'ve never believed in.\\'Normally, my father would have brushed my response off with a simple \\'just try harder.\\' But today\\'s father-son discourse was different: he knew I was serious. My response unmistakably sounded rehearsed, an asset that played to my advantage. Dad understood that I had given this conversation much thought, and for that reason he respected what I had to say. This was the man who taught me the Way, the Truth, the Life, but this was also the man who taught me to voice my own opinions and shape my own life. For the first time, my Almighty Father, a man of few words, opened up. To him, Jesus saves. He told me of his tragedies: his sister\\'s death, his surviving a near-fatal car accident, and his older brother absconding with the family fortune. He wanted me to understand the context in which he became a follower of Christ. He wanted me to find solace in religion because that was how he overcame his hurdles. But I\\'m different. I expressed how calling on religion in times of trouble would be hypocritical of me. I knew what I believed: God doesn\\'t exist. I wouldn\\'t concede that. I won\\'t put my life in the hands of a Being whose existence I cannot ascertain.My father saw that I had made my own conclusion based on my evaluation of the evidence. He saw that I had used sound logic to decide that I was no longer going to attend church: why sit in a service for hours when I could be in a library, a park, a coffee shop? A cup of coffee and an issue of the LA Times on Sunday mornings better tended my spiritual health. I explained that my time was better spent in my own sacred spaces.I reached out to him not as a son, but as a man of principle. Through calm discussion, I found common ground, engaging him with rhetoric the way I couldn\\'t with religion.And when we left the living room, I felt proud that we hadn\\'t just spoken as father and son, but as equals.  \"}, {\"index\": 646, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I stroll alongside the bank of the Potomac River, enjoying the beautiful evening on September 1st, 2015. Three years ago, I walked along this same path with my aunt Rahel. Even though she had not intended to, she had changed my life that day. I chuckle as every step overwhelms my unsuspecting mind with dear memories. I make futile efforts to keep them at bay, but they come rushing through me, like a flood.  *** My eyes flew open; it was 8:47 AM on September 1st, 2012. As I lay in bed contemplating my recurring morning dilemma, to sleep or not to sleep, my bedroom door creaked open. Slowly, I peeped from under my sheets to find Rahel searching for her house keys, getting ready to leave. I shut my eyes in denial, only to be confronted by my inner voice urging me to go with her. Suddenly, I blurted \\'Where are you going? Can I come along?\\' She looked back at me, one foot outside the door, and replied, \\'Sure, why not!\\' And so it began: As we walked beside the Potomac, we savored the beauty of the day. The sun\\'s pleasant warm rays seemed to feed energy to every being in sight. Before we knew it, we had walked for almost six miles! My sandaled feet were beginning to ache, so we went to sit on a bench in front of the Crowne Plaza. \\'It\\'s interesting; very interesting!\\' she exclaimed, pointing to the hotel. Curious, I asked what she was referring to. \\'Seven years ago,\\' she said, \\'I sat here and made a commitment to pursue the dreams that seemed impracticable then.\\' I listened with fascination as she shared, one by one, the stories of how they came true. \\'Don\\'t ever limit your dreams because your mind does not know how to manifest them yet. If you can truly love it enough to imagine it vividly, God will help you do it,\\' she told me. Her words ignited a spark of hope within me. Before that conversation, my dreams were just wishful thinking; I feared that the bigger I dreamt, the less likely my dreams would come true. I had believed in playing it safe. But the insight I got was like a wakeup call that jolted me from the daze of mere existence into the splendor of truly being alive. Suddenly, I realized that my life was like an unwritten book, and each day, was an empty page. So, I picked up my pen from where it had laid unnoticed and began to write my story. Inspired, I too set out to pursue my dreams. Though I did not know how they would come true, I decided to take small steps in the direction I wanted to head in. Life became sweeter as I tried to find enjoyment in everything I did, whether it was an arduous basketball practice session or trying to understand complex concepts in AP Biology. Spiritually, I came to understand that I am not a body with a soul, but rather a soul inside a body. In the process of trying to develop a better spiritual connection, I found myself. I no longer suppressed my uniqueness in an attempt to \\'fit in\\'. I embraced who I was, but also patiently gave myself room to grow into who I wanted to be. Three years later, as I sit on the same wooden bench, I feel like I can still hear her words, and I cannot help but exclaim, \\'It is very interesting, indeed\\' in reply. I have been both humbled and relieved to discover that there is so much more to life than I had imagined! Within these past three years, so much has already happened, and yet, it is only the beginning. My feet now ache for the journey ahead, assured that the realization of my hopes is right around the corner.  \"}, {\"index\": 647, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  The paper stays blank until you write your name; that is what I have learned. As a Hispanic male from a low income community in Los Angeles and a mixed-status family of seven, I have become experienced in the difficulties and disadvantages of our society. Opportunities are scarce in my neighborhood, and to find any, you must have more than a pen and paper; you must write your name. The first time I wrote my name was in ninth grade: I decided to switch from my local high school to a more distant one with more resources and rigorous courses. Ever since, I have migrated schools annually in search of a challenge. I have had to find my own script and personalize it, for the paper stays blank until your name is written on it; initiative is key.     Likewise, an egg will remain an egg unless a hatchling emerges. I have always been very quiet, abandoning the heavy socializing tasks in the island of the talkative, but eventually, the hatchling grew bored of idleness, of being restricted by a shell. Consequently, my last high school years have been devoted to developing social skill and participating in my community more; I have gradually broken my shell. Now, fully assimilated in my high school community, I have constructed unbreakable friendships and connections, adding meaning to my eggshell. In addition, I was a founder, and now am the leader, of the S.T.EA.M. Club at my school, participated in more clubs, and cared more about my health and fitness. Hatching from my egg has incited more self awareness and opportunities in my life, demonstrating me I have great value: I am much more than an egg.     Competition is a one-man sport, literally. Competition has lurked its way into my life from all angles, leading to both failure and success, and throughout my life, I have understood that genuine competition comes from within. Because no one has your exact characteristics, you can never compete fairly, so I compete with myself. School, sports, and everything I participate in incorporates self competition; that is how I have grown the most, since I am able to realize my weaknesses, my strengths, and my interests. Instead of perceiving the people around me as adversaries, I see my neighbors as role models, as people to learn from. Furthermore, learning from my environment has been my most useful tool, since in my early childhood, my resources were more constrained. In consequence, competing has never been my priority, but in school, competitiveness circulates the entire student body: everything revolves around the best score, the best grades, and the best awards. So to take advantage of my high school experience, I have always isolated myself from the atmosphere of competition and worked for everyone\\'s benefit, because in the sport of competition you are always a winner if the winner and the loser is you.  The sweetness of a cookie does not solely depend on the amount of sugar it has but also on the amount of ingredients. Similarly, my life has always been about school and academics. My passion is learning, but I have learned that there are other significant ingredients to life: personal interests, outside activities, and personal betterment. Philosophy, physics, fitness, soccer, guitar, mathematics, and computer science have become main components of my life. After starting the STEAM Club, I was able to plan and supervise our engineering projects, and the experience allowed me to realize that my interests could be applied to many branches of life. So in the summer, to get a vivid experience of science exploration and life after high school, I applied and was accepted to a couple programs at different universities. The summer programs allowed me to attain a better understanding of life, about my talents. In a similar context, my goal for the summer after tenth grade, as a result of not being able to fund my acceptance in the Harvard Secondary Summer Program, became to lose weight and change my eating habits. By the beginning of the next year, I lost fifty pounds, and to this day, attaining my best physique has been one of my most significant aspirations. In essence, although school is the path towards success, the sweetness of my life depends on more than school; it depends on my individual needs. In essence, my paper tells the story about a hatchling outgrowing its egg with a font of competitiveness and a sweet taste of cookies. I have written only my first name, for I have an entire sheet to go through, but the writing utensil remains in my hand and on the paper, slowly making its mark in my life. My life is still a blank page.  \"}, {\"index\": 648, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'I haven\\'t eaten yet, but I\\'ll take some fruit to the car.\\'My twelve-year-old self then witnessed a shift in my father\\'s face as his jaw slacked and his light blue eyes snapped to mine. Fear bubbled to my throat when I saw that cold gaze. In one bound, a monster\\'s face was before me, claws tightening beneath my chin, making me see stars as they threatened to wring my head from my shoulders because I didn\\'t wake up early enough to eat at the table. Following a silent drive, I was met with a new nickname from the throng of new faces--the girl with the \\'hickeys\\'. My homeroom teacher wouldn\\'t look me in the eye.I went home miserable but stoic. My father spoke first.\\'How was your first day?\\'\\'Oh, it was good.\\'\\'You made a good impression on your teachers?\\'\\'Of course.\\'\\'Good. You are very mature, Sophia. You have good judgment.\\' My mother gripped her chopsticks as her eyes passed over the three ovals left uncovered by my hair.\\'You\\'re not going to get any calls. And thanks, dad.\\'Later that night, we fought. I couldn\\'t bear the taunts any longer and ran downstairs. My sister snuggled in my bed and when she fell asleep, dried tears crossing her face, I slipped out the window and crossed the street in flannel and flip-flops. A sizable hill sits between the lines of trees, and at the top is the perfect place to soak in starlight. While climbing, I can still hear the occasional curse word, but at the sloped summit it is absolutely silent. After making a pillow out of my hair, I laid back and found the brightest stars in my favorite constellations. From our distant perspective, the points of light are hardly unique. We might recognize one by name, with the help of its parent constellation, but the nature of each individual star\\'s development requires a level of investigation. I know that stars burning too hot too quickly become deserted on all sides, eventually collapsing into shadows as they run out of fuel. On the other hand, some stars are so proximal that they consume and orbit one another, never to become independent. My favorite kind of star, however, begins life with a massive core. She sheds her outer layers, growing as much as her energy supply allows, before leaving in an explosion--a supernova that undulates for eons as its nebulous remains nurture the new stars of the galaxy. Then, that beacon projects its comforting glow 5,300 light years to a little girl looking for the Cygnus constellation. The celestial bodies that kept me company became unlikely examples for my own life. At the time, the struggle of standing in as a fiscally adept individual amidst the chaos was unbearable, but I wanted my inner strength to make an outward appearance. Since I could not change my family, I worked actively to change myself. I shed layers of dejection and the burdens of feeling powerless fell to my feet; no longer defining my character--no longer limiting my abilities. The accomplishments that would mark my growth began to materialize, each one renewing my ardor for achievement.  My mother fought for my place in a piano program where I received a musical gift that I cherish, and I studied for days before taking placement tests in Gifted and Talented programs at the University. I grasped the value of education at a young age and developed the reputation I desired for myself. In concordance with my inquisitive nature, I developed medical aspirations after speaking with a neurosurgeon during my father\\'s stroke recovery. Once I became old enough, I began working on the Neurology floor of Sparrow hospital as a volunteer and trainer. Those around me recognize that I am committed to uncover the best opportunities of my environment, whatever they may be. When a circumstance proves to be unpleasant, I am unafraid to change the scenery myself; if materials are absent, I make my own.I grew up in an area where gunshots riddled the night and it was acceptable for teenagers to run me over with bikes. Yet, I confronted the messages of fear that pervaded my childhood and evolved, embracing visions of the world more massive than the one I knew instead of complying with my surroundings. My accomplishments now remind me of what I have not yet done, and my idealism has molded my perspective of the future: it\\'s not a question of what I want to do in my life, but of what I want to do first. Through dedication in the office, at school, at home and in my future, I\\'m committed to make an impression that can enlighten and inspire the next generation. \"}, {\"index\": 649, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 650, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'Remember, it is okay to lose, just as long as you know why you lost.\\'These were the words that were spoken by my debate coach at my very first debate tournament.  This simple, yet profound phrase rings into my ears every time I enter a debate space or any other challenging environment.  Of course, knowing why you were defeated is the only way to come out victorious, whether in the space of policy debate, sports games, business meetings, or whatever events in life turn out to be a competition.  While these words provide great advice in the case of adversity, there is always that little jarring thought in the back of my head that tells me that I\\'ve \\'screwed up\\', that mental slap-on-the-wrist that I receive in the event of defeat, that drive to win and to be perfect to my finger-tips; this is also known as the perfectionist side of me.I often remember being referred to as a perfectionist during most of grade school.  My end goal would almost always be to receive an \\'A\\', if not greater in my classes.  I often remember my mother saying that \\'I am my own worst critic\\' because of how I would feel if I didn\\'t not do well enough.  At times I even remember coming home crying because I had gotten a \\'A-\\' on my report card, or if my project was not picked to be put on the board as one of \\'the best\\'.  I have used this urge of perfectionism as a personal motivator in my studies.  I was amazed at my capacity to work so hard, yet I was afraid of when I would inevitably fall short of perfection. This side has demanded that my grades are either perfect or unacceptable, that I must prove myself at each step that I take, and that I must not accept any less than the best. While I would often consider myself both my harshest critic and motivator, my parents have been there every step of the way.  I have been taught by my parents that I could achieve anything that I wanted to, as long as I worked hard to achieve my goals.  Because of them, and I have always strived to do the best that I possibly could, almost as a way to prove to others that I can achieve it if I work hard enough.However, along with these words of motivation and praise, I have also received much less encouraging news about my opportunities.  While I have been told that I could accomplish anything that I wanted to if I worked hard, I have also been told that I will face difficulty and discrimination due to my race and my gender, that people will immediately judge me based on these characteristics, rather my skills or attributes.  Like most girls and children of color, this lesson is all too common.  It can become even depressing to learn that there will be fewer opportunities available to you because of traits that you cannot control.  As I grow older and learn more about myself, more uncontrollable obstacles come into my path.  I soon realize that the city that I have learned to love is suffering at the hands of gentrification and is affecting how I shop, live, and even attend school; my peers and I are coming into the realization that college is a lofty and expensive goal that many of us will not obtain easily.  As all of these things are happening at once, as well as the common struggles of being a teenager, it just may be enough to make someone\\'s head spin.  I realize that obtaining perfectionism becomes more difficult as the days go by.While the quote mentioned by my debate coach is good in the debate space, it is not as easy to take in when opportunities are taken from you because of race or gender.  As I realize that I must realize my limitations and understand I am a flawed person, I also must realize that I am just as capable as everyone else, and my value is not determined by the color of my skin.  I plan to become more involved within both communications and social justice advocacy.  While I do want to become a journalist, I also want to spread awareness and advocacy for gender and race equality, because regardless if you are a perfectionist, under-achiever, or something in-between, no one should have to be told that they will receive fewer opportunities because of the way they were born. \"}, {\"index\": 651, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] All my life I\\'ve been stuck right in the middle between fitting in and feeling completely different from everybody else. It wasn\\'t easy making friends as that kid who got dropped off by his \\'abuela\\' every morning at a primarily white elementary school, and then again as the only \\'Americano\\' after my family relocated to Tlaxcala, Mexico. It was a challenge growing up under the microscope-like spectacles of a strict Jehovah Witness mother and maturing into the liberal-minded man that I am today in the conservative state of Texas. At the time, I didn\\'t realize how many of my differences were actually strengths, but the real hindrance about this was that neither did anyone around me.The lunch table had always been a unique spot during my adolescence, growing more and more significant to my life after every year of school. The topics up for discussion were nothing like those of my family dinners, and I often felt like I had nothing valuable or even appropriate to contribute. None of my American friends wanted to hear about my sister\\'s pi\\\\u00f1ata party, and the only reason kids seemed to talk to me in Mexico was to hear how the names of inanimate objects sounded like in English. The subjects I cared about were irrelevant, unless they involved a funny-sounding word that only caused my peers to laugh at me.It wasn\\'t until high school, where I was surrounded by a more diverse group of people, that finally I understood how the differences between myself and others, and the qualities we all present to the world, could have a real impact. Here I wasn\\'t that kid who never had enough money for the movies, or who brought \\'weird\\' Mexican food in a paper bag, or who was \\'boring\\' for not celebrating certain holidays. My stories soon started to become relevant to others and even more so to myself. I fit in without actually fitting in, and that\\'s what made it feel right at last.Even then, however, no different from my earlier years was the time spent at my dinner table, where my traditional-minded mother posed little tolerance for any conversation that didn\\'t correlate with the Bible scriptures framed throughout our home. This was definitely exclusive of stories about the cat I cut open in anatomy class or my gay best friend, though these were the stories I yearned to share. I caught on to the fact that there are limits to what we can say and to whom we can say it, but there are no barriers that restrict what we can learn from it.What I didn\\'t realize until my time in high school, now nearing its end, is that these diverse perspectives are what have allowed me to mold and expand my own. The more comfortable I became with my own background, the better I got at being myself and appreciating the individuality of others too. I know through experience that prejudices and misconceptions can limit conversation, friendship, and even world progress. But by implanting my own words into the discussion of our universe, I hope to make a difference with the unique characteristics I contribute along with everybody else\\'s. \"}, {\"index\": 652, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The blare of the buzzer reverberates throughout my living quarters at 05:00 every morning.Today\\'s uniform: faded red sweater and my favorite pair of knock-off vans. \\'Time to head out,\\' but before I leave, I check to see if my guardian is awake to continue the morning procedure.

God made me special, right? Living with a disability, I sought to convince myself of internal worth at a young age. Nothing truly combatted such worth until I reached high school and listened more closely. Surprisingly, words murmured behind my back dug a lot deeper than inquiries and insults to my face. Whereas before it merely represented a conversational ice-breaker, albinism began to define my identity. No longer did others know me as the theater kid with chamber music on his iPod. Rather, I became a sight to see. \\'I saw a shooting star!\\' \\'I saw an albino!\\' I never had the urge to fit in. With strikingly blonde hair and ghostly pale skin, standing out is a reality, not a choice. Not appearing \\'normal\\' took no emotional toll, but a growing perception that I didn\\'t appear \\'human\\' did. Thus, I resolved in my first month of high school to hide my albinism at all costs. Perhaps then others would see me as another human being instead of an archetype. The consequences of this decision changed my self image forever. In addition to causing extremely white hair and skin, albinism also renders my vision severely impaired, presenting numerous challenges in an academic setting. The high school offered many routes of assistance, all to my silent rejection. Large print textbooks collected dust as I struggled through headaches to decipher the smallest of fonts. Whiteboards remained miles away wherever I sat in class. Using assistive equipment would signify surrender to the disability; thus, my conciliatory efforts continued. Despite a partially successful attempt at masking the extent of my condition, albinism remained a nametag I wore shamefully every day. The once routine process of satisfying others\\' curiosities now caused routine blushing and clammy hands. I gave off an impression exactly opposite of what I sought to create. Instead of allowing my true self to shine through, I sank deeper into a pool of insecurity. Perhaps this aim of indulging an unrealistic personality enflamed my theatrical passion. My first journey in another man\\'s shoes helped reveal a love for drama. I reveled in the opportunity to live as a person without the constraints of albinism, portraying a wide array of interesting personas ranging from angst-filled teens to short, flamboyant kings. Whilst living out my dream of escaping albinism, I realized a striking commonality amongst these characters.  Each has a unique set of characteristics that puts their story into perspective. Idiosyncrasies such as the teen\\'s eccentric twin or the king\\'s daddy-issues help color in between the lines of characters\\' decisions and motivations. Audiences clap for and live through these stories because of their uniquities; would others come to know my story possibly through my albinism? Did I really need to hide the obvious to be myself? This theatrical epiphany profoundly impacted my perception of identity. I could no longer hide my condition, neither a healthy nor beneficial act. I am not necessarily proud of my albinism. Yet it still remains a piece of my soul: as I walk, as I talk, as I act. Truly finding oneself comes through the actualization of all aspects of one\\'s identity, not simply highlights. I now volunteer in the albinism community, sharing my story and helping younger generations overcome their similar insecurities. I openly discuss my condition with anyone who asks. Continuing to hide would prevent me from acting the part I was cast for by nature. I am unique. Not because of albinism. Not because of that chamber music on my iPod. I am unique because I am ready to live each scene of my life to the fullest, positive or negative, technicolor or pale. \"}, {\"index\": 654, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 655, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] When I signed up for Happiness class last winter, I never expected that a course based on such an elusive and intangible ideal could make me so \\\\u2026 happy. Over the course of the trimester, I read Plato\\'s Allegory of the Cave, HH Dalai Lama\\'s The Art of Happiness, and The Four Noble Truths of Buddhism. I also examined the influence of trees on happiness and economic stability and watched hours of TED Talks on the intermingling of environmental health and quality of life. My studies led me to an important realization: No definition of happiness can be derived without a discussion of human ecology and community.This realization was not born from Happiness class alone, however. I was concurrently taking Interdisciplinary Environmental Expeditions (IEE), a field studies class combining literature, ecology, geology, regional history, and wilderness skills. Although I\\'d already been conditioned to find happiness in the fresh mountain air of the Three Sisters Wilderness and the melodic rippling of Wychus Creek, I never felt so at home as when I stood atop Renfrew Glacier with my IEE class, bedecked in crampons and a bright orange climbing helmet. Amid the vast expanse of ice, I remembered my research exploring the effects of nature on the human mind and spirit. And here I was, happy, a guest of the mountains.My partnering of Happiness class and IEE also brought me closer to my community. I spent three days with a small group of students, interns, and adult leaders rafting on the lower Deschutes River. We learned to navigate ferry angles, perform river rescues, and guide the raft through Class Four rapids. However, the most enlightening part of the trip was how my community was involved in the expedition. College students taught us how to rappel down cliffs, biologists showed us how to measure the health of the riparian zone, and local writers led poetry sessions as we perched atop boulders in the new spring heat. It dawned on me that my little town houses a wealth of people with incredible experiences and skills and the willingness to share their knowledge. From their example, I realized that participating in my community is one of the most important things I can do to be happy.In another project, I studied environmental changes in Camp Polk Meadow, about half a mile from my house. Wychus Creek, which used to meander freely through the meadow, was straightened by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1964. The Deschutes River Conservancy restored it to its original meander just a few years ago, and my IEE class set out to measure how this change affected the meadow\\'s vegetation. Through our transects, we verified that there were fewer invasive species as well as higher concentrations of plants, such as willow and alder, that provide a healthy stream bank and high water quality for steelhead. It was rewarding to present our findings at the Deschutes Watershed Summit, a gathering of conservationists, scientists, and students. I found myself highly invested in the fate of the meadow and eager to share its importance with my community. I discovered the sense of place so often celebrated in my Happiness class as the key to contentment.These experiences in nature and within my community, combined with my studies in Happiness, showed me it\\'s possible to have a personally fulfilling and simultaneously sustainable relationship with Earth. This knowledge is the compass that will guide my future. \"}, {\"index\": 656, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Every individual comes from a unique, eclectic world, shaped by memories and dreams, past experiences and future aspirations. The baffling complexity of someone\\'s personality cannot be told in a handful of words, yet an eloquent description of a passion can be an effective tool to communicate the insights of a person\\'s core values. Running is one of my passions, the keystone to the development of my athletic and spiritual life.When I was in the 9th grade, my parents bought a house in Florida and gave me the opportunity to take classes at a middle-school for three months. Without really knowing what to expect, I joined the mileage club and started running every morning before class, twice a week. It quickly became riveting; as I was a complete beginner, my learning curve followed a solid progression and I was elated to get better every time I hit the field. I ran a total of 67.25 miles, almost catching up to the best runners. This awe-inspiring introduction to running gave me a passion. For my senior year, I decided to join a triathlon club to receive specific training on my running skills. It has been a terrific journey, participating in numerous races with school and at local events, meeting wondrous people with whom I share the same passion. The poetry in this sport will never cease to amaze me. I live in the mountains in France, where the slopes are sharp and the air is fresh. As I make my way through the thick fog of the morning, feeling my muscles pulse and my heart filling itself with vigor, the esoteric beauty of the trail unravels itself. The delicate colors of the leaves, the wisdom that sleeps in the majestic rocks of limestone and granite, the breathtaking view when you reach a summit, the soothing sound of glacial water racing down for the lake; this is my secret garden, giving me energy and inspiration. Athletics can be a remarkable source of education, as it has helped me build a strong work ethic. Running long distances is strenuous and requires physical practice as much as mental preparation. When your legs ache and you\\'re breathless, an inner voice tempts you to give up and listening can be frighteningly enticing. However, I have started to recognize this human weakness and find the motivation to raise above it. This sport has been a great gift, guiding me to become someone better. Passions shape our lives, and therefore our world - mine is idiosyncratic and cheerful, diverse and curiously imperfect. It will always evolve as I mature, changing the color of its skin like a reptile, aiming to constantly improve. I learned that the road is full of promises, unspoken dreams and infinite possibilities that hide in plain sight. And deep down, I know that I will always love running just as much as I love life. \"}, {\"index\": 657, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  When most people hear \\'summer\\' they think rolling oceans, suntans, and beautiful warm weather.  It means long, relaxing days on the beach.  To me, however, \\'summer\\' means something completely different.  It means pristine lakes and remote forests.  It means spending all day paddling, portaging, or walking alongside (lining) a gorgeous wood-canvas canoe and camping somewhere new every night for six weeks.  In short, it means Keewaydin, a summer camp for canoe tripping in the Northern Canadian wilderness.  It can be difficult for people to imagine why tripping appeals so much to those of us who spend our summers on the water. We wake up every morning to staff shouting, \\'Up and roll!\\' and within one hour we are expected to have dressed, packed our belongings and tents, eaten breakfast, loaded the canoes, washed dishes, scrubbed pots, and to be ready to paddle away.  We trip in all conditions, no matter wind, rain, fog, or shine.  We trip in the unbearably hot and the unbearably cold and sometimes we even paddle at night.  We battle with thicker swarms of mosquitos and black flies than most people experience in their life, whether we are lining our boats because the rapid in question is too shallow to paddle or we are portaging all our gear around a rapid too big to run or too shallow to line.  And portages are difficult enough without the bugs.   Imagine a 95 pound canoe resting on your head as you walk along a path that is barely wide enough to walk and often barely there at all.  You might take a step and slip on a rock and nearly injure yourself and your very fragile load; you might take a step and fall knee deep in mud that can steal your shoes.  The bugs are bad but you are too tired to move your arms.  All you want is to break down in tears and throw the canoe off your head and collapse, but crying will only make it more painful and you don\\'t have a choice but to finish.  But every portage comes to an end, and as the trees start to thin you realize that you are almost there and when you finally take that boat off your head there is no better feeling.  You look up and all you see is beauty; the sun shines onto glistening water lined with thick evergreens.  Everybody offers sincere congratulations and you couldn\\'t be happier.   Those moments are the reasons I keep coming back.  I don\\'t necessarily enjoy being crouched on my life jacket amidst of a raging thunderstorm or trying to steer the canoe while huge waves beat at me from seemingly all directions except my back, or lining up a strong rapid waist-deep in freezing water knowing that one false step could send me, my boat partner, and my canoe rushing down the rapid, or wearing the same filthy clothes every day for six weeks without washing them.  In fact, I frequently have to ask myself why I choose this camp to occupy my summers when I could get a job or relax somewhere warmer.  But I always come up with this answer: tripping with these people in these places in this manner teaches too many irreplaceable life lessons.  I learn that small things make a difference, like packing backpacks at night rather than scrambling in the morning or getting that knot just right so that the canoe doesn&#39;t float down a rapid.  I learn that it\\'s rewarding to leave my comfort zone.  And most of all I learn that no matter how bad the pain is, the pride always lasts longer and the sense of accomplishment always outweighs it.  I come to much better terms with who I am and what I can do, and that is why Keewaydin is central to my identity. \"}, {\"index\": 658, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\\\u2022 Describe a place or environment where you are perfectly content. What do you do or experiencethere, and why is it meaningful to you?Dear Mr. Lewis, Enclosed are the three \\'Drogins\\' that you asked for.  In addition, I\\'m sending five cards from Vermont, seven cards from bicycle shops, a card with the last name \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Lewis,\\' and four red cards\\\\u2014your specialties.  My specialties are vertical cards, cards from restaurant and jewelers, cards with animal faces, foreign cards, and, of course, Drogins.  I look forward to trading with you again in the future.  Happy collecting!Sincerely, Ellie IBCC #449 Three weeks after I sent this letter to Brownsville, Texas, I found a thick envelope in my mailbox containing twenty business cards to add to my collection.  As a member of the IBCC\\\\u2014a network of International Business Card Collectors\\\\u2014I am part of the not so widely known world of business card collecting, sorting, and trading.    When I was seven years old, I started picking up business cards wherever I went\\\\u2014the tailor, the bookstore, restaurants; my personal favorite was the doctor\\'s office, which contained a display of the cards of all of the doctors in the practice.   I then started asking my friends and family for help.  For my twelfth birthday, I requested that my friends give me twelve business cards in lieu of a gift.  Just when I reached about 3,000 cards, I discovered the IBCC.  This group allowed me to expand my collection because I gained access to a network of people with cards from such far ranging places as Guatemala and Japan.   I quickly caught on to the proper business card etiquette and terminology:  cards with pinholes, paper clip marks, or writing are strictly forbidden for trade, and cards must be placed in 2-by-4 manila envelopes for trades.  A \\'die cut\\' is an oddly shaped card; an \\'aptronym\\' is a card of a person whose name reflects his profession, such as a painter named \\'Art.\\'  Marc Drogin, a British artist, has become famous in the business card world for designing personalized illustrations for cards known as \\'Drogins.\\'  I got my first Drogin from my own orthodontist, Dr. Opin, who had a particularly coveted card: an aptroym-Drogin.  Dr. Opin also gave me Mr. Drogin\\'s contact information and business card.  When I struck up a correspondence with the artist, he happily sent me numerous cards, including some that are no longer in print. My experience in the world of business card collecting has taught me to advocate for myself, to be independent, and to be proactive.  For example, when IBCC #138 tried to convince me to trade away my Drogins, I had to politely yet assertively decline.  I have also become quite resourceful as I can tell my friends where to find a dentist in Tallahassee or a Chinese restaurant in Milan.  Most importantly, the business card world has been the one place where I can merge my myriad interests:  a card from Costa Rica expresses my love for traveling and international affairs, while the card from my school\\'s yearbook publisher reflects my love of writing and serving as editor-in-chief of the yearbook.   Now that I\\'m older, I seek out cards in professional settings\\\\u2014from the parents of the children for whom I babysit, from the judges at Mock Trial tournaments, from the owners of houses that I rebuilt after Hurricane Sandy, and from the physical therapists at the rehabilitation center in Israel where I worked this summer.  Even though I do not have as much time to spend on my collection as I did when I was younger, I cannot resist picking up a vertical card when I see one.  And each time I get a new card, it reminds me that hopefully I\\'ll have a chance to organize those 2,000 cards left in my \\'To Sort\\' box to add to my collection! \"}, {\"index\": 659, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] It was a dark and stormy night \\\\u2014 but actually, it was.A new tradition arose a few years ago at our band camp, the Hunger Games (don\\'t worry, there is absolutely no murder involved); it is an amalgamation of small, seemingly-pointless minute-to-win-it games that pit the different sections of the band against each other, proving who truly has the most spirit. I saw an opportunity in the event this year \\\\u2014 a catalyst for social growth within our group; words cannot describe the passion that we brought into that event. It was beautiful, such a pure representation of the togetherness that we had been lacking for a good time \\\\u2014 it was back. Over our heads, a flag that we had scavenged to craft waved above us, inscribed on the white bed sheet was our rallying point, \\'DRUM LINE.\\'There was a new level of moral within the group \\\\u2014 we had come so far; there was so much progress to be proud of, and those feelings could be seen on every face. Outside, it was the coldest summer night that I can fathom \\\\u2014 chaos had overtaken the sky; sheets of rain fell as thunder and lightning roared through the night. With all forty members of the drumline below me, looking up, I began to ascend the director\\'s scaffolding with the flag, carrying the progress and the dreams of the group with me \\\\u2014 the scaffolding swayed with the wind as I climbed; facing the opposition of the rain, wind, and lightning, I made it to the top. There was a perfect spot for the staff of the flag, and in the most meant-to-be way, I stabbed the flag into the top of the scaffolding. It felt as if I had finally connected the dots of my emotional spectrum, a paroxysmal, year-long reflection. That moment represented the struggle and perseverance needed to make my vision come to life. Through night and day, our flag flew sixty feet above the field in the face of adversity.For the last six years, our band program has been in dismay; we have gone through nine directors \\\\u2014 one change in leadership can leave a scar, let alone nine. For the last half of a century, our percussion program has been a powerhouse, consistently one of the top programs in the state. Seeing the FHC drumline when I was younger is what inspired me to make this activity such a large part of my existence. Seven years ago, I began studying with the man that made our program what it was; a word thirty times stronger than inspiration couldn\\'t come to describe his impact on me \\\\u2014 as so much more than a musician.Percussion makes me who I am; I could never work as hard as I do now without ever having practiced into the night on my flam drags or slaving on the perfect street beat. I felt that it would be an injustice for these young adults in our program to leave our school without feeling the absolute pursuit of excellence; every person deserves to feel the joy and empowerment that can be achieved. I took over the program; working against the rotted culture was, to this day, the hardest thing I have done and still am doing. I run the zero hour class, give private lessons, write the music, and even meet with parents. We\\'re good, too. It has become my life, but what better use of my time is there than inspiring love and education? None.Many take adulthood as purely responsibility, but for me, adulthood is being responsible for inspiring passion and love within our troubled group, leading the ensemble in the face of ever-growing adversity. Nothing has been more empowering than this season \\\\u2014 the feeling of succeeding yourself is fantastic, but being responsible for that same feeling in forty people that you love is incomprehensible. \"}, {\"index\": 660, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] This is it! I am at the top of the world. The entirety of New York is spread out before me, and the headlights of cars inching down grid-patterned streets below are like hypnotized fireflies flying in the semblance of straight lines.Beep, beep, beep!The microwave goes off behind me. I spin around, grab a set of oven mitts off the lab bench and take the agarose gel out of the microwave. The smell of the clear liquid mixes with the heavenly odor of alcohol-infused catfish chunks and awakens my senses. The process of extracting DNA is long and smelly, but I relish every step. My research is one of my many passions, especially since I have the opportunity to complete it at one of my favorite places, the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), a cave of riches for the Ali Baba in me.It all started when I won a raffle at my local library for tickets to AMNH. As I roamed the maze-like halls, I quickly deemed the tickets a better alternative to a golden ticket to tour Willy Wonka\\'s Chocolate Factory. Thanks to school trips and free passes to AMNH, I started to learn that there was something larger about the place than I had imagined. I knew I had to see more.The AMNH website became my friend as I searched for ways to get involved. I discovered a museum that the public does not often see, one with educational and research endeavors. I knew then where I wanted to be: the back rooms.I applied to summer camps and after-school classes at AMNH with two intentions: to see more treasures and to land myself a position in the coveted Science Research Mentoring Program. I was able to do both. I held items from the vast collection, interacted with researchers, and learned what I could not learn in my high school. After classes in genetics and genomics, I conducted my own genetics-based research with a museum ichthyologist on catfish in their labs, through which I learned more than just genetics. I now know how to use technology and various programs for data analysis, as well as lab techniques. AMNH became a secondary school to my primary secondary school.My bond with AMNH strengthened through YouthCaN, an environmental group. I started exploring NYC environments with AMNH educators, and found myself hiking down peaceful winding paths somewhere in the heart of Central Park, learning about glacial striations in its famous boulders, or about how anthropologists are now realizing that there was a town in the middle of where the park now stands. Crazy stuff, but exactly the type that kindled a sense of excitement in me. AMNH brought me to the outdoors by showing me other things that I love.Curating for AMNH Teen SciCafe also brought me into the back. Working with researchers and other people who are passionate about their work was exhilarating, and it gave me a glimpse of what I may want to do in future.The American Museum of Natural History is my sanctuary. A visit to the planetarium makes me feel minuscule, a step into the Butterfly Conservatory re-inflates me, the inexpensive food in the StaffCaf fills me up, and an emotional documentary in the IMAX Theater breaks me down. My ability to recite the \\'museum is closing in fifteen minutes\\' spiel in multiple languages makes me laugh, while honing my skills in French and Telugu under the pretense of helping tourists gives me a thrill. The entire place helps me put my life into perspective. It was here where my dreams became a reality, where my past connected with my potential future. For that, I am eternally grateful. \"}, {\"index\": 661, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 662, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Forms, the basis of Taekwondo, is performing moves as if opponents are attacking from all sides. I wanted to take forms to a competitive level, so I entered into the Colorado State Championship. After earning last place and witnessing smaller boys performing traditional forms flawlessly, I became motivated to learn the standard of my sport, even if it meant driving up an hour to another dojang to learn. After a year of hard, focused training, I competed in the U.S. Open Hanmadang with athletes from across the nation. My team was the last of three well-trained groups. When it was my turn, I approached the center with a fast-paced heart and unsteady legs. With each step, I was thinking through what I had learned but also letting my muscle memory work. I was transported into a world with only me and my teammates. It was only our moving bodies full of grace and power dancing a fierce attack. After our arc hands struck our imaginary opponents\\' necks, we froze and got back to ready position simultaneously. We stood strong waiting with anticipation for the judges to make the final decision. Out of breath and sweating, the score came up on the monitor and revealed that we won first place. There was an initial moment of shock as I became aware that we had won. After the hard work of hour-long practices, back-to-back classes, and after-class training, a medal placed over my head rewarded my hard work. The greatest lessons I have learned in Taekwondo are determination and perseverance. On the blue and red mats, the class turns into a day for practicing forms, again and again. My body gets tired and my arms want to drop. I want to do less than perfect, but I know that if I continue to persevere, I will improve and get stronger. I pay attention to every stance and strike. When class is over, I take a short break and then resume practicing the forms on my own. I correct my mistakes, so I can get it right next time. I leave the building sweating and smiling after an accomplished day. Since Taekwondo helped instill character traits of determination and perseverance, I wanted to share that knowledge with other people. So in the summer of 2014, I went to an orphanage in Haiti where I shared how to overcome obstacles. To represent this idea, each child came up and broke a wooden board in two. One boy slowly came up to the front for his turn. I could see the hesitance in his face as well as the eagerness of his eyes. Behind him, his family, all the children and adults in the orphanage, were cheering for him, beating the narrow wooden tables to create a drumroll. I held the wooden board with two hands and a smile for encouragement. His hands reached for the air and came down striking the board, but it did not break. He tried again, but the board still remained in one. He looked up with disappointment in his eyes; I smiled at him and brought the board closer and held it tighter. I knew he could do it. He just had to have determination and perseverance. I wanted to teach him what I learned through Taekwondo that helped me in my life. So, I asked with my eyes to give it another try. His eyes turned fierce as he reached his hand above the board one last time and overcame the board, breaking it in half. He returned to his seat with a smile, proudly holding his broken board. Through determination and perseverance, people can overcome obstacles to arrive at success. I will continue to use these character traits wherever I go, hoping that I also encourage others to do the same. \"}, {\"index\": 663, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I believe in the power of the hallway.I attend a high school filled with everything from a robotics center to a three-dimensional anatomy table; there exist so many special locations I could label \\'home.\\' And yet, I still find myself happiest when walking through the somewhat stuffy, overwhelmingly overpopulated, yet comfortably carpeted hallways I frequent between classes.  Discussions in my English class feel far-reaching, and cafeteria conversations run rampant with a sugarcoated artificiality I\\'m too exhausted to stomach. Pretension appears everywhere \\\\u2013 except inside the sacrosanct hallways. In these corridors, true connections are formed, whether through exchanges between friends during the sparing moments between classes or by walking from the Mathematics building to the History building. Everything about hallways is interpersonal and interdisciplinary.  I all but teardown the stairs of our atrium after spotting myfriends. The moment my eyes meet theirs, ear-to-ear grins spread across all of our faces; it is only a matter of seconds before we burst into laughter at the mere sight of each other.Our conversation fluctuates between our weekend plans of hiking and the ravioli we plan to cook once we arrive home.However, our collective mood is not always jovial and lighthearted; we are all prone to our stormy skies. Perhaps a tear-stricken one ofusdescribes the catastrophicfight her parents had last night - I take her dejection as my cue to procure a healing stash of gummy bears from my backpack.Maybe I\\'m the grey, cloudy one plagued by miserable Physics problem sets, in which case my arsenal of friends takes it upon itself to bring a toothy smile back to my face via a combination of ridiculous faces and cringe-inducing jokes. In classrooms, we experience well-intentioned rigor and intensity; in the hallways, we rediscover our humanity.I\\'m a student who possesses far too many interests to settle on just one or two, and these all-affixing hallways enable me to make the interdisciplinary connections I\\'m so desperately in search of. The few minutes I spend in the hallways between classes are really the only times I\\'m permitted to reflect during the chaotic school day, and the reflections I find during these sacred moments are amongst those I value most. Maybe while walking from my Research course to my English course, I\\'ll bridge the gap between that novel text-parsing algorithm I just read about and the analysis of existentialism in Albert Camus\\' The Stranger; a stroll from my Statistics class to my Art History class may prompt a revelation about trends in Byzantine art and their subsequent diffusion to other cultures. The fact that these hallways quite literally connect Math classrooms to History classrooms to English classrooms to Journalism classrooms also hasn\\'t passed undetected to me; it\\'s almost as if the walls are entreating me to make those interdisciplinary connections, to diversify my academic experiences, and to equip myself with something that extends far beyond an ordinary school day. I believe in sincerity, I believe in connections, and I believe that the power of the hallway sees fit to encourage both. Never mind the formal pretenses I assume during class, and never mind the seemingly insurmountable distances between various academic disciplines. Being a seeker of connections, as long as I have my precious hallways to assist me in my quests for cohesion, my brain will remain placated. \"}, {\"index\": 664, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] 17th August 2015:As I went through the photographs I had taken as a part of the survey I was conducting in underserved Indian villages (for my solar energy project), I could not help but think of the stark difference between India\\'s urban and its rural areas. Here I was sitting in my air-conditioned room\\'s comfortable couch gazing at photos depicting my fellow countrymen toiling in the farm under the blistering sun, without even the basic amenities like electricity, to make ends meet. My concern for my fellow countrymen and a desire to uplift their lifestyles using my technological skills, continued to chivvy me. I wanted to do more\\\\u2026Rewind to where this interest arose:Today I know that my fascination for engineering began serendipitously, when as a six-year-old I used to slip out of my Professor father\\'s cabin to explore the University. To say that I was enchanted at what I beheld, as I looked through the electrical laboratory\\'s glass doors would be no exaggeration. Seeing students work on intricate circuit-boards using an assortment of tools as their ideas transpired into models of cars or robots, spoke to me. I too wanted to be an engineer. Moreover, many of my foreign-educational trips exposed me to the soaring shells of the Sydney Opera House and I gained cognizance of its complex engineering, as did the scientist at Intel\\'s museum in California who explained how integrated chips had paved the path for the world to enter into a new era of computers. Now, I saw the marvels of technology everywhere and understood its ability to impact our lives, nay transform our lives and I started thinking of ways to do so, as an engineer.As part of the bank\\'s social obligations, my banker-mother frequently made trips to remote villages for community work. I accompanied her on such occasions. This up-close interaction with the rural folks made me realize how technology had benefited those who had harnessed its power. I remember being impressed by the fact that in a small village, Bundi, villagers had replaced unclean burning kerosene lamp with Solar LED lamps to tackle long power-cuts.Inspired to research technology that could help the underprivileged became my biggest passion. I got my first Socio-Scientific Research project on Solar Energy this April at IIT-Bombay and another on Biofuel in May. The former involved maximizing power-output of the solar cells. The study took me into the fascinating world of Power Electronic System, LDRs and Solar Tracking panels. Consequently I researched the applications of solar energy, Biofuel and their effective implementation. Visiting a fishing community in Mumbai and villages near Pune, gave me invaluable insights into what villagers and fisher folks required. Studying about powering fishing boats through cheap biodiesel and designing a plan for effective installation of solar water pump in an actual farm are some milestones of the projects. Through surveys, I undertook feasibility studies for the undertakings, and presented it to the Principal Scientific Advisor, Central Government and to the Rural Development Ministry. That was of the utmost importance to me because I had taken my work to the final authority. While surveying the farmers in remote villages, I could see a ray of hope in people\\'s eyes, as I generated awareness and showed them the videos and photographs of developed villages in India and abroad which had biogas plants and solar lighting system. Clearly technology can change the destiny of many of these remote villages. I want to keep using my skills in such a way that on my next visit to these villages, I feel proud of my contributions to their development. My interest in using technology as an empowering tool has been mounting and my application, rather I as a person would be incomplete without mentioning this undying passion. I know this interest will take me on a journey rife with challenges, which are but opportunities for me. \"}, {\"index\": 665, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The slope of my roof is 66 degrees. Most people feel uncomfortable carrying expensive equipment 25 feet in the air on a 66 degree slope. This is the place where I am most content. My roof is a site of enchantment and awe. This place is my springboard to the majesty of the universe; it is the place where I directly interact with my greatest passion - astrophysics.Everyone who knows me knows that astrophysics is the subject that occupies my mind more than any other. I prefer to define astrophysics with the words of my greatest intellectual idol, Carl Sagan. Astrophysics is the study of the cosmos - \\'all that is, or ever was, or ever will be ... the greatest of mysteries.\\' I hope that I can spend a lifetime exploring that grand mystery, lost in the science of space and time.I am not quite sure what started my ascent into interest in astronomy, but once it began, I rose quickly. My curiosity became tangible when I bought my first telescope with the money I made teaching martial arts. I now regard that purchase as the most significant of my life. I have used my telescope to watch Jupiter and its moons beautifully pirouette on their axes. I have used my telescope to see the Orion Nebula and the Ring Nebula and I have tried and failed to contain my unbridled excitement as my eyes catch light that has traveled for more than 1,000 years to reach my humble position on the roof of my suburban home. I have used my telescope to fall in love with the universe. My time on the peak of my roof has brought me so much knowledge, and in turn, so many questions. I cannot help but want more.My encounters with astronomy have not always been groundbreaking and paradigm shifting. There have been nights of frustration, of failure, of unpredicted cloud cover and unexpectedly high humidity. I have tried dozens of other locations in an effort to maximize my observational effectives, but to no avail. I always seem to end up back on my roof, staring through my eyepiece into the universe. I am perfectly content with that.Astronomy never came as easily to me as many other things in my life. I have never spent hours trying to get a single task done in the martial arts dojo. I have never toiled for weeks over an essay, or a speech, or the opening statement for a trial. Yet, I have faced the same challenge for days upon days willingly and numerous times in astronomy. This is a testament to my passion. For nothing else am I able to endure hours of intricate and tiresome tasks with such good spirits. There is, and always will be, something cerebrally delightful about watching the products of natural law unfolding before my eyes. I cannot shake the feeling that I will always want to come back for more.My rooftop endeavors have dumped me before a daunting mountain of knowledge of which I have barely climbed a foot. Books, lectures, videos, and magazines only briefly alleviate my curiosity. After learning about one thing, I am left with even more questions about others - stars, galaxies, planets, and even space itself. My abundant inquiries about the cosmos are akin to an enormous ocean. In college, I plan to dive in headfirst. One day, maybe after years of swimming through the waves of amazing facts and laws and phenomenon that I am eager to learn, I will land on a new piece of knowledge previously undiscovered.Soon, I will be attacking my curiosity with the voracious ferocity of a college education. I have no plans of slowing down. The investigation of the universe is my chosen journey, and it is made possible by the inspiration I have received by looking adoringly into the sky from my steep, red-shingled roof. \"}, {\"index\": 666, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Over three hundred million cubic miles of wonder\\\\u2026 The ocean holds so much mystery, yet it has always been a place of peace for me. The way she dresses herself in every combination of blue and green as if attempting to communicate her mood mesmerizes me. The way my vast, aquamarine friend leaves me tiny gifts on the seashore each morning leaves me in wonder of her capabilities and the treasures from her heart. Simply sitting on the sand, watching the waves ebb, gives me the same tranquil feeling as playing the piano or painting. With piano, I create art with sounds as my medium. I am the master of my music, just as the ocean is the composer of the rhythmic crashing of the waves.  I made friends with the ocean long before learning to swim. Yearly snorkeling trips to the Florida Keys introduced me to fish of every color, shape, and size. I was acquainted with fish that would nibble at my fingers to say hello and others that peered shyly at me as they camouflaged in the dusty sand. I learned which fish I could (futilely) chase and which coral reefs to avoid. As my father educated me on the unique traits of each creature that fluttered past us, the question continued to cross my mind: was there anything that one could not find in the ocean? As I learned more and more about these captivating inhabitants, I was reminded of the limited amount of knowledge we possess on the ocean. Two-thirds of the sea have yet to be explored. Of the critters that have been discovered, they are as bizarre as creatures concocted from a child\\'s imagination. Those unknown beings that have yet to make their debut to the world above could take the form of anything. Who knows? The ocean could hold a remedy for common diseases or even an answer to the energy crisis. I began to realize that although the ocean is a wondrous home to the Earth\\'s most beautiful creatures, it was the potential it embodies that brings me comfort. The ocean, filled with mystery and possibility, was just an illustration of my comfort environment. When I realize the number of opportunities awaiting me, I am filled with excitement as I envision the paths of my life leading to a plethora of open doors. With the magnificent sea as my role model, the possibilities of what I can create and become are endless. Each year brings waves of new possibilities to me, washing upon the shore of my life like the seashells waiting to be plucked from the pristine sand. Surrounded by opportunities is when I am most content. Yet what good are these positive circumstances if I do not act on them? The tide will whisk away these gifts, sending them back under the ocean\\'s surface if I do not seize them.

I honestly struggled keeping up my motivation in high school. However once I finally found a very steady source, it made life much easier and it kept me going much longer. I lived in Missouri until I moved to New Jersey for my 8th grade year. My high school, while it is admired in New Brunswick for having the motivated students in the city, does differ from the kind of schools I attended the majority of my life. I realized this in the beginning of my freshman year. I began noticing that my peers would copy the homework from each other. Others would completely neglect their homework. I was in shock that someone would disobey the honor code and have so little care for their grades since I was not aware of the lack of motivation that existed in the city. In Missouri, integrity was one of the most important values. Being surrounded by people whose priorities are to do the bare minimum made it difficult for me to stay as ambitious as before. Eventually, it became one of the reasons I was so motivated. I did not want to lower myself to their level of nonchalance towards their future. I kept studying, taking the most difficult classes, and making sure I seeked out any opportunity such as free SAT preparation classes. I kept myself moving and on my toes to keep hitting the ball until I made it through each hit of peer pressure or difficult tests. Another lesson in tennis is that if you lose the point, forget about it and focus on the next point. Sometimes a good hit can come your way. I have learned that life can hit some fastballs that you cannot reach. One of them were when my brother began to have seizures. He had cerebral palsy beforehand and I was already used to taking care of him, but it became much more difficult with his epilepsy. It was beyond my control and made the whole family afraid of what they meant. My family had to take my brother to various specialists and I had to come to help translate since they did not understand English very well. At the time, I haven\\'t put in much thought into what I wanted to become in the future even though my school is specialized for students that want to enter healthcare. While I translated for my brother\\'s neurologist on several occasions, I began to explore the subject of seizures and understand the complexity of the brain. I began to do a bit of research and even requested to focus on neurology when I began to shadow careers at the hospital with my school. I also learned how much a doctor can really do for a patient and what a difference they can really make on a family. While I did not ultimately decide on neurology, the interest in wanting to help others and the anatomy helped me realize that I would enjoy becoming a physician. The first ball was out of my control, but I learned something from it and it helped me move on to the next point. One rule of tennis that is important when playing doubles is that you have a partner for a reason. If you need help, you need to ask. My family is extremely humble and if we need help, we will ask. That is one of the main reasons I want to become someone who helps others such as a policymaker or a doctor. I want to give back for all the times someone has helped me. Before Christmas of my junior year, my mother received a call from the school. The secretary told her that each year they choose a family that is in need to donate gifts for Christmas and that we were chosen. We were afraid at the time, since my father was recently incarcerated again, that we might not be able to celebrate because of the cost to hire a lawyer. The anticipation from my brothers from opening the packages of candy, gift cards, and clothing and my mother\\'s happiness to not worry about finding money for gifts demonstrated why sometimes receiving help is the best thing to do. This small gesture from the school really made a difference in my life and somehow I want to repay all the small gestures that were ever done for my family. After applying all these tennis lessons together, the result will be a great tennis match.  \"}, {\"index\": 668, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] During the summer, the rotten carpet and the smell of spit permeates the room. Here I am \\'Melery\\' because my first hack at the marimba was not at all as melodic as my name would suggest. Within the confines of the band room, every facet of my world comes together in perfect harmony. I rock hard on the clunkiest instrument I can find and let the musical trance hypnotize me into a state of euphoria. Looking back, I realize my high school life has been defined and shaped by this reeking room, and I would not have it any other way.The minute I enter, I am not welcomed by cheerful greetings. Instead, my bandmates look at me with scorned eyes and turned shoulders, only to give up the pretence and burst into laughter moments later. A strange sense of humor spreads throughout the room, an eccentricity that immediately drew me to this band of geeks. Here, we are all initiated to a society of Doctor Who fanatics, Korean BBQ addicts, and marimba maniacs. These \\'weirdos\\' are my family; when the cultural stigma from my homogenous mother country urges me to withhold my inner idiosyncrasies, my mates encourage me to unleash my inner Hulk, with a voice loud as a banshee and \\'dance moves\\' like the Tasmanian Devil. So, long after school is over, I pitch my tent in the band room and buckle down for hours of practice, impromptu jam sessions, and meaningful conversations about music and life in general.Although the environment provides a haven, that was not always the case. When I first entered, I was terrified by the reputation that preceded the band director. Quiet and reserved, I had a hard time meeting his forehead, let alone his eyes. The rumors abounded of his fiery aura and predilection for yelling. He took one look at me and proclaimed, \\'Marimba!\\' I had no idea what I had gotten myself into. I looked at the Frankenstein of an instrument consisting of a xylophone and wind chimes. With a strike, discordant yet harmonic melody resonated through the bars and I was immediately addicted.The director incessantly yelled at me, trying to help me master the marimba. The rumors were right; his yelling was unmatched by any howling monkey or a Halloween fright-fest. Yet, each yell pushed me harder to groove, to sway to the rhythms and nod to the music. A marimba player\\'s technique and skill only displays half the talent. The other half lies in the way we move with our instrument, and my dancing skills are unparalleled in their ability to clear a room and throw everyone into a hysteria of laughter. When I first walked into those doors, I entered as the super shy girl who walked with lowered eyes. Under the guidance of my director and the fellowship of \\'bandos,\\' I grooved to my marimba as awkwardly as possible, hands still raw and fresh, begging for blisters to appear. Now I walk into the room with an aura of confidence, excited to wrap my bruised and calloused hands around the mallets. With each sway and bob, I am one with my instrument and my passion flows through my arms and pours over the marimba\\'s keys. On the marching field, I clumsily fumble over the cart that carries my instrument. In the band room, I am stationary and allowed to exude the full force of my musicality.After four years, we endure through the moldy carpet, the manual labor, and the director\\'s now ever encouraging yelling. Here, our season begins with pep talks, progresses through rehearsals, and ends with a solemn goodbye to the seniors. I have watched my fellow geeks, fanatics, and weirdos come and go, and thanked them, for each has shaped me in their own unique way. Here there is no judgment-only music and hilarity persevere. Here, I am \\'Melery\\' the \\'Marimba Maniac\\'. \"}, {\"index\": 669, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Up until three weeks ago, I believed that adulthood could be designated in a 3.37 by 2.125 polycarbonate rectangle. I know it sounds silly, but growing up I labored under the same misapprehension; adults had driver\\'s licenses, while children did not. They had the independence, ability, and responsibility that children could not grasp until their 16th or 17th birthday; in my case, it was three roads tests in the five months after my birthday until I finally acquired my rightfully earned driver\\'s license.After that wait, which I referred to as an injustice, I had lost all or any appreciation I once had for a license. My celebratory \\'first-drive\\' was to McDonalds; in the unusual amount of time I spent waiting for order 343 to be called, I thought I\\'d finally take out my long-sought license and get a good look at the card that at least made me feel like an adult.\\'That must be the best feeling on Earth,\\' the man next to me, who I later found out was named Jos\\\\u00e9, said as he saw what I was holding in my hand. I looked confused, which prompted him to continue: \\'Or at least it was for me. I can finally drive my kids to school, get a job, or go to places that want a government-issued ID. That license, finally, made me an American.\\' My introverted-teenage mindset was shattered; prior to that conversation, I believed that having a license was a right rather than a privilege. It was for me what it was for any 17-year-old: an elevation of status, an opportunity for a car, or simply what I, a solid driver, deserved. Initially, that\\'s what stimulated my frustration with having to take three road tests. I felt entitled to a license after every one, which left me even more disappointed after I\\'d fail. It was hard not to want something that all my friends had, especially when it was substituted with months more of supervised driving and hitched rides. It was only after speaking to Jos\\\\u00e9 that I cultivated an unwitnessed appreciation for my circumstance. I love that this seemingly easily-attainable license, which people so often take for granted, I get the opportunity to treasure. I now have a constant reminder that although I may not get things on the first try, \\'failure,\\' per se, does not have to exist in my perception of reality. Perhaps it can be \\'three times a charm,\\' or \\'if not this time, the next.\\' Although they were uninvited, the five months showed me the that there is an unseen merit in waiting. Unlike immediacy, waiting affords a change of perspective that invites patience, reflection, and appreciation for things that otherwise wouldn\\'t have been given a second thought. I can honestly say that the months I spent further practicing have unarguably made me a better driver. Moreover, I\\'ve had the pleasure of meeting some amazing people in the the past few months; from instructors, to examiners, to fellow students, these people are a wonderful aftereffect of my failures.I still don\\'t know why my McDonald\\'s order took nearly twenty minutes, but I am indebted to the fact that it did. As a teenager, I am often principally concerned with my own affairs and perceive situations through my own narrow lens. Jos\\\\u00e9\\'s circumstance offered me a different one; a much-needed, broader lens. The unexpected change of perspective helped me make the transformation from my little self to the larger world.  In a certain way, I believe that\\'s exactly what adulthood entails\\\\u2014 keeping things in perspective and remembering the larger world in light of such trifling problems. Positivity and patience are a sign of maturity; an advanced individual can always be perceptive and make the best of undesired situations. I don\\'t know if would\\'ve came to these realizations if it wasn\\'t for the once-displeasing chronicle of my license; for that reason, it will always be more than a mere 3.37 by 2.125 inched polycarbonate rectangle.  \"}, {\"index\": 670, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 671, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Paradise of the Insane\\'Can I please get your autographs?\\'Adam Matthews and Dean Jens stare blankly at me as I hold out my nametag for them to sign. After a chuckle, Dr. Matthews scribbles an illegible signature; Mr. Jens follows suit. And so, I receive the signatures of the greatest celebrities never known.Adam Matthews and Dean Jens are Science Bowl alumni who moderate and read questions during the final round of the National Science Bowl every year. As a player of the Quiz Bowl-esque science and math competition, my involvement with their fandom began in freshman year, when I first watched the then A-team compete via live stream. Since then, I have had the privilege of twice occupying that coveted position on the finals stage and compete while listening to them read questions. To most people, Dr. Matthews and Mr. Jens are no more interesting than John Doe. To me, they are the superstars of Science Bowl.  My classmates exhibit a profound lack of excitement when I proudly display my keepsake to them the following week.As a freshman, I was initially intimidated by the intense drive to succeed which pervaded Mira Loma Science Bowl. How could I possibly find the time to write fifty practice questions a week, understand organic chemistry, or reach the level of ability exhibited by A-team seniors? But as I delved deeper I found a community centered not around work, but around camaraderie and challenging one\\'s limits. Before Science Bowl, I had never understood what being part of a team truly meant. I had never genuinely known the feeling of building the unconditional trust and interdependence that transforms a group of people into a coherent, functioning team. There were days when I absolutely did not want to open my textbooks or to write questions; there were those when I was overrun with schoolwork and contemplated putting Science Bowl off to tomorrow. Becoming captain last year placed even greater responsibility on my shoulders - I was now not only expected to coordinate practices and motivate my peers on top of studying and question-writing, but to also help our coach pick new members of the team. Amidst the difficulties of juggling my various commitments to school with my dedication to Science Bowl,  what kept me functioning was the idea that I was part of something larger than myself, an organism which had the capability to be something more than the sum of its parts; I was driven by my obligation to my teammates and knew that they too felt the same way as I did about the situation. For three years, I spent Wednesday and Sunday afternoons with nine other students, each with a buzzer in one hand and a pen in the other. Debates about the \\'purest\\' scientific subject, discussions regarding the correct pronunciation of the phylum \\'Arthropoda\\' (arth-rahp-ah-da or arth-rah-pode-ah?), and squabbles over who would occupy the coveted position of reading practice questions are all par for Mira Loma\\'s Science Bowl practices. I pored over textbooks, challenging myself to understand all the concepts contained within. Despite the torturous hours spent studying and writing questions, I nevertheless looked forward to Science Bowl; it is a home where I can not only express my fanaticism for learning and satisfy my desire for competition but also a place where I can find other individuals who felt the same way. It is a place where I have discovered how to trust my peers, listen to those wiser than me, and guide those who need help. Back at nationals, after receiving the autographs I rush back and display the signatures to my teammates/fellow Science Bowl fans. They scramble over to where Dr. Matthews and Mr. Jens are standing to receive their own inscriptions, and I smile, for I have found a place where I am not alone in my insanity. \"}, {\"index\": 672, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I get lost.Ninth grade geometry began my fascination of the world and its principles. The unified and coherent system of geometry built around simple concepts--lines, circles, and polygons--captured my interest, as the idea of a system with so much clear depth seemed so unreal. How can an individual such as Euclid build such a strong base of conclusions? Soon after this class, I became lost in a world tied into my reality--a world which spurred an intellectual curiosity and greater understanding of the world that had to be built upon.This happens to be the world of mathematics. The world of math is surrounded by treasures meant to be discovered. In a sea of unknowns, I find the answer with only a few scribbles, only a few careful deductions. With just a few observations, I can make predictions of the future--I become the psychic with symbols. In examining graphs, with their  paths dispersed in all directions, I can discover where these paths travel. I can see, and prove, where these graphs halt, fall into infinity, or split in their direction. Even with one\\'s velocity, I can discover their future destination. I can even discover the volume of shapes as contorted as the Walt Disney Concert Hall. This world is all fabricated. With just a few simple ideas, I build my understanding and explore this world further, and use what I know from this world and apply its ideas to what is reality. In this new world known as math, I am its explorer. It is these very explorations that have shaped my life and the direction I intend to go with it. My abilities to discover new forms of learning within math has served as both an escape and an aid. My work at Kumon Learning Center and my many tutoring ventures have intertwined with my love for service to allow me to not only discover new concepts and how others view them, but how I can shape them into different forms of problem solving. Even outside of work or volunteering, math is a leisure through the lectures I find on Coursera or MIT Courseware. In my future, I will find new direction in my explorations by seeking the seemingly endless quantities of mathematical knowledge at the university level. My goal is to breakdown the world of analysis--to discover the theorems and headaches of understanding infinity--and to apply this knowledge to other fields such as economics. With this appreciation I hold for math and its energetic depth, I will harness its energy and transfer my explorations onto others as a teacher or professor. But that is not to say that all the learning from math has been purely mathematical. Existing within an unexplored world allowed my mind to seek out all possible solutions to problems--ones that exist within math and ones within reality, as well. Immersing into the math world has revealed the multifacetedness of life; I have discovered that reality is more than a single perspective, and that every step within life lays new perspectives. The conflicts of today do not bound me by the consequences present in my life: the solutions and many perspectives I seek in problems within reality always exist, if given enough insight. My world is not meant to be bounded by unforeseen consequences or opinions; it is the world I shape on my own through my own explorations, and college will be yet another medium meant to be explored. \"}, {\"index\": 673, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Its great to be great, but its greater to be human.-- Will RodgersMy story starts like the story of many other Latino Americans, in that I grew up in a bilingual family, none of my family had ever been to college, we had to struggle just to keep food on our plates and clothes on our backs, and faced discrimination by others almost daily. We had to strive to great lengths just to keep what we had while it seemed like the rest of the world was trying to keep us down. Struggling is part of the human condition, but it is not what makes me different than others. I do not let the hardships I have faced define who I am, because I am more than just a sad story, i am me.To say that I went through these challenges untouched by the hardships around me would be untrue, many times i was greatly affected by the obstacles we endured. The most vivid memory I have of this is when we were buying our monthly groceries at Walmart; our EBT was not accepted and we were forced to put all of our food back. I was too young to fully understand what happened, but from the pain I saw in my mothers face, and the disgust I saw from others, I then learned what it meant to be poor.Through hunger I have learned the meaning of hard work; through discrimination I have learned to love unconditionally; through pain and loss I have learned to appreciate what I have; through helping others I have found compassion; through family moral I have found virtue; and through life I have found what it means to be human. The fires of my ambition were not extinguished by any challenge I faced, nor was I ever overly daunted by any task that I would have to ascertain. To live is to challenge one\\'s self to strive further, or to be more understanding, or kinder, with the ideal that every challenge brings new obstacles, and very obstacle only makes us stronger.I do not ask pity for what has transpired in my life, but i do ask for an understanding; I ask that my existence not merely be based on the hurdles I have faced. In short I am me not because of what I overcame, but because I learned to overcome. \"}, {\"index\": 674, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  Last summer, my grandfather and I sat down to begin typing his life story. I initiated the page with \\'The Life of Lewis Miner\\' and was ready to continue but my grandfather would not start reading. He asked me for the computer. A few rather painful minutes later, the screen read \\'A Serendipitous Life\\' and he was ready to commence his story. I am indebted to his example of simplistic gratitude and appreciation of the smallest moments. My name is Catherine Miner, I am 18, I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, and my life is not comprised of drastic change and great discovery. My life was built upon admiration for the knowledge that every day is a new opportunity to change my own life and hopefully help others along my way.     Delving into social science has allowed me to recognize that our world and all of its systems revolve around an individual\\'s efforts to improve what they interact with and to magnify the positivity in every situation. As I live principles of progress which allow change for the better and strive to celebrate the humanity that surrounds me, I find that even the smallest moment can make a huge impression. In 2014, I participated in Utah Business Week where I was chosen to be CEO the first day. I thought I was doing a marvelous job as our company won many awards and everyone expressed their marvel at how their week had gone, until the last day when a peer in my company pointed out that while I had helped organize our company to greatness, I had failed to attempt to sit with her at lunch. Her words struck me. By ignoring the great opportunity I had to learn from a marvelous peer, I had robbed our company as well as myself of an opportunity for growth and development. That week I learned a lesson I have not forgotten-- people are always the most valuable asset available.      Since that opportunity, I have been provided with innumerable chances to view and learn from a variety of individual\\'s impacts on their situations. Principles of social science have been demonstrated to me in the best possible way, through my development of relationships and one-on-one communication with not only teachers, but senators, the elderly woman who lives next door, and the miraculous people I have met on trips to Europe.      If I were to title my life history, I would call it \\'A Serendipitous Life\\'. I have been fortunate enough to understand the value of hard work, determination, and allowing my passion for learning and improvement to guide my every decision. I am in control of who I become and I am choosing to be my best. What could be more serendipitous than that? \"}, {\"index\": 675, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'This is one thing you\\'re not gonna get. You don\\'t deserve it.\\' These were the last words I wanted to hear three years ago, and they have been turning over in my mind, propelling me forward ever since. Unsuccessfully holding back tears, I thought to myself, \\'Who is he to criticize me?\\' A child\\'s entitled views are rarely accurate, and looking back, it\\'s hard not to laugh. In Judaism, the Bar Mitzvah signifies a child becoming responsible for his actions. In Hinduism, the Upanayanam celebrates the transfer of spiritual knowledge to a child, indicating maturity. My road to adulthood, however, was not marked by formality or ritual or heritage, but by the difficult realization that the person I had become wasn\\'t the person I wanted to be.I started playing golf when I was six years old and the Arcadia Par 3 driving range immediately became my second home. By the time I entered high school, I was certain I would make the varsity team as a freshman. Unfortunately, my attitude wasn\\'t up to par. I acted arrogant and bragged that I would have no problem making the team. My very first shot at tryouts set the tone for the rest of my round: I hit the ball 30 yards right of the fairway. Then, shocked by my mistake, overwhelmed by sudden insecurity, I panicked, and without thinking or collecting myself, shanked it again. My entire sense of self-worth and the illusion of perfection I had built were shattered by this single mistake. Embarrassed, I turned in my scorecard and simply left the tryout after my round, not realizing that these actions were far more telling than my bad performance. Two weeks later, the coach called me to his office and said I would never be on his team unless I changed\\\\u2014that being disappointed was one thing, but giving up in the face of adversity was unacceptable. If I didn\\'t become less self-absorbed, I would have trouble not simply with golf, but in my personal relationships and even finding a job. I tried to dismiss his words as the complaints of a grumpy old man, but they lingered and forced me to see myself as a na\\\\u00efve, egotistical child for the first time.    I realized that I wanted to change. I was reminded of a lesson from my childhood, the Hogwarts philosophy: \\'Help will always be given to those who ask for it.\\' I let go of the notion that I had to be better than everyone at everything, and flawed expectations of infallibility changed into a more mature understanding of myself. My desire to become a compassionate, confident friend allowed me to break free from the grasp of my pride and see my environment in a whole new way. When someone offered me help or advice, I graciously took it in the pursuit of becoming a better, but not necessarily perfect, person. I came to realize that there is great strength in vulnerability, that my imperfections were not weaknesses, but fundamental parts of my human nature.One year later at tryouts, my first shot again sailed right of the fairway and into familiar trouble. I took a deep breath, collected myself, and strode to my ball, thinking about how I could handle the damage and get out of the rough. My cockiness had thankfully vanished, replaced by a quiet confidence. I did not try to impress others, and I was much more comfortable with myself, both on and off the golf course. As I continue to grow, I see the person I want to become\\\\u2014a thoughtful, ambitious adult\\\\u2014as an attainable goal. Like golf, life is full of unexpected traps and hazards, but by reminding myself of the value of humility and perseverance, I feel more prepared for these inevitable yet certainly surmountable challenges. \"}, {\"index\": 676, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I look up. It\\'s one hundred and ten feet to the top, the best place to view the whole ship. With a harness across my chest and prussic attached, I stand on the rails, put my hands on the metal, and begin to climb. It is my first summer on the tall ship SSV Tole Mour, and I feel just like Jack Sparrow, dreadlocks and all. I don\\'t dare look down, my legs shaking as I step higher and higher up the wooden rungs to the top of the mainmast. I reach the top, climb through the opening and sit down, swinging my legs over the edge. Although my steps to the top are uncertain, I calm my breathing and look over the horizon. If I feared a life of absurdity, like that of Sisyphus, here, I feel endless possibilities. The sea calls to a certain few. Those who hear the call will be bound to the pulse of the ocean forever. I have heard the call, and I am here to answer it.I climb down the mainmast and stand on the sturdy teak deck. I look around. It is time to set the sails. Reaching and pulling on the lines, heaving and bending, the music begins to take form as the sails start to move. Like my hands straining against the weight of the lines, my bow moves in sync with the rest of the first violins, the seconds and cellos following in step; Dvorak comes alive. The harmony of sound and motion when setting the sails comes together in a symphonic sense of triumph. There is an unspoken feeling of satisfaction shared amongst us when setting seven, two thousand-pound sails, like playing the booming excerpts of Dvorak\\'s New World Symphony. Eighteen bodies work in complete unison as seven sails are hauled up; it is sheer artistic beauty.   I was once asked in an interview, if I were to have any superpower, which would I choose? The answer was obvious- to fly. Although wanting to fly seems like a childish wish, on the Tole Mour, I am encouraged to soar. I am free of social constraints, allowing me to discover and learn without being bound by judgment. I observe microorganisms under a microscope; I brave the nighttime waters of the Pacific to view bioluminescence in all its glory; I sail at night by the stars. The grandeur of the Tole Mour is overwhelming; she fosters a spirit of adventure in the crew that mans her. I step onto the bow and allow the crisp air to nip at my cheeks. I look down at the sea and welcome my rite of passage. The choppy, cresting waves of the Pacific lie twenty-five feet below. Above me is nothing but the blue of the sky, the white of the clouds. My arms are convulsing, squirming, uncertain; there is nothing to hold on to. The only way down is to jump, the free fall gifting me with five beautiful seconds of bliss, five seconds of understanding. I close my eyes and wait. This moment, the moment before I allow myself to step away from the edge, before I take a leap of faith, is when realization sets in. For five seconds I am one with nature. I am surrounded by purity. It is this simple realization that connects me to a world of Thoreau, Stravinsky, the Smiths, and Andre Agassi. Seconds before I splash into the ocean is when I am a violinist, a composer, a tennis player, an environmentalist with solutions, and a dreamer. I open my eyes and I am content and confident.

That\\'s right: leash babies.I was a leash baby.  Despite the early-years leash, my parents gave me a lot of breathing room growing up.  They entrusted me with the authority to choose my own boundaries.  They entrusted me with the responsibility of making my own mistakes and learning from them.  One of the biggest struggles: time.  I struggled with managing my time.  I, ultimately, was the one who had to decide whether I should do homework or hang out with my friends.  It was difficult...impossible even to pick between the two.  So I did both. 5:30. Snooze. 5:35. Snooze. 5:40. Awake! 6:30. School. 2:30. Gym. 4:30. Socialize. 6:00. Eat. 6:30. Homework. 12:00.

I felt an obligation to be perfect in order to be worthy of my parents\\' trust.  I needed to be perfect...or at least as perfect as my sleep-deprived body would allow.  My desire to reach these expectations of myself motivated me to push boundaries to the extremes, academically and socially.  I took every honors and AP class that my counselors would allow.  I wanted everyone to know my name and know that I was approachable regardless of who they were. My desires devoured each other.  Time I spent hanging out with friends was time I regretted as a lost opportunity to study. Time I spent at home was time that my friends were hanging out without me.  The ideal me was happy -- an impossible kind of happy.I needed a yank of a leash.Why was I doing all this?  Who was it for?  What did my parents hope to teach me by giving me all this freedom?  The answer was a question itself: what made me happy?  Being the most popular or smartest in the  class...these were things I thought would make my parents happy.

On a warm August morning I sat shivering and shaking in the waiting room to my doctor\\'s office. I had my mother make the appointment but didn\\'t give her the reason; I\\'m not even sure I really knew the reason. I just knew something was wrong. The past five years had been all uphill - outwardly, at least. I was doing increasingly well in school, growing more independent, and had greater opportunities at my feet. Inwardly, however, was an entirely different story. Those five years felt like an upbeat movie I was watching while in my own personal prison. I was happy for the characters, even excited for their accomplishments. The problem was that my outward self was a character entirely distinct from the internal me. Despite each great achievement and happy occasion, I felt nothing positive from them. It became hard to do even the things I used to love because it seemed that I gained nothing from them now. My family and friends began to notice some idiosyncrasies in my behavior, but I blew them off out of shame for my lack of ability to feel normally as they did. I came to consider the possibility that I was clinically depressed, but quickly dismissed it because it seemed I had no reason to be that way. Depression is a weird thing. It\\'s like an enemy whose tactic is to convince you that it is not really your enemy. You spend your time wallowing in self pity, berating yourself for said pity, then pitying yourself for the berating. It really is a vicious cycle that drags you lower and lower, all the while preventing you from seeking help out of fear of becoming more of a burden than you already are. Sometimes, it gets so bad that your only options are to break the cycle or to let it kill you. I chose to break the cycle.  I broke down crying in the middle of the waiting room only to be red with embarrassment by the time my doctor called me in. But the experience, no matter how negative it felt at the time, marked a great step in my journey to recovery, happiness, and maturity. It seems ironic that my increased reliance on others - medications, doctors, counselors - that came from that appointment marked my transition into adulthood, but for me, maturity was less about becoming independent and more about recognizing when I needed help. Realizing my condition was a leap in my self awareness, and making that appointment meant I was taking steps to better myself. I\\'m still on the road to recovery, but I know that my newfound maturity will allow me to seek help on the way. \"}, {\"index\": 679, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] When I was in middle school, I was asked to help my friend make a music video. I had no idea this video would end up getting over two hundred million views. I only appeared in the backseat of a car for 11 seconds of the 3-minute video, but when this video spread online like wildfire I became the target of millions of strangers\\' comments. Before I knew it, people from around the world were calling me names like \\'awkward\\', \\'stupid\\', \\'ugly\\', and worse. Every word stung. They told me I should kill myself because I would never recover from being in the \\'world\\'s worst music video ever.\\' The saddest part was that I felt that no one could help me. My parents had never gone through or even seen anything like it. My friends had no idea how to handle it. I was drowning, and no one could save me.  Until my mom threw me a life jacket. My mother, the brilliant woman that she is, found the perfect way to help me realize that this fiasco was temporary. \\'Does what they say change who you are?\\' she asked. \\'If they told you that you were a boy, would you believe them?\\' I told her of course not. She asked me then why did I believe anything else they said? That was my life raft. When I learned to respond to negativity with humor and poise, the tables turned, and I knew I would be okay. In fact, it would be more than okay. I became a leader. When kids across the globe saw me respond to bullying with confidence, they asked me how I did it. That\\'s when I realized that online bullying was actually an epidemic.  And some of these victims saw inspiration in me.  So I set out to help them. In 2012, I started a non-profit organization called That Girl in Pink (one of the monikers given to me), dedicated to the prevention of teenage suicide. Through the foundation, I speak to middle and high schools as well as boys and girls clubs across the nation. My presentations focus on bullying and how to give help to those in need. I have received a heartfelt \\'thank you\\' from every principal and club leader. Because of my presentations, more kids have been finding help with their problems. I receive emails from kids telling me that because of my presentations, they stand up for others they know are getting bullied. These were the exact results I wanted to hear. I didn\\'t want to save every kid myself. I wanted the kids to stand up for themselves, or learn how to stand up for others. In this way, I taught them to swim.My foundation also raises money for charities that help kids, like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. That Girl in Pink\\'s team for a CFF walk spread to 13 countries, including Spain, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, the Philippines, and Australia. Together, the teams created a video showing every corner of the globe coming together to do good. The online world is an unpredictable one. You never know what will be posted, what will go viral, or what people will say. I learned that none of that matters. What matters is how one handles it. This world helped me change from an ordinary 14-year-old girl to a leader and a lifesaver. I plan to continue my campaign against bullying. I dream of expanding my foundation and educating more young people now, so that no one is left without a life jacket.  \"}, {\"index\": 680, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 681, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  It was closing night with more than a thousand people in the audience; I was anxious. Ironically, it was not because of stage fright but \\'The Circle,\\' our drama department\\'s tradition. The entire cast was to link arms and exchange words of gratitude and encouragement before the curtain rises. However, this would be the last circle of the show with these specific people; emotions would be running high\\\\u2014including mine. I have and always will hate crying in front of people. I was anxious because I knew that when it was my turn, I would not be able to stop my tears from falling. But why?            In sixth grade, I was diagnosed with anemia and ITP, a condition where the immune system destroys its own body\\'s platelets, making it hard for blood to clot when needed. Due to ITP, I bruised extremely easily and any physical activity became difficult. In order to suppress my immune system, I took high doses of Prednisone, a steroid with side effects of rapid weight gain and muscle loss. The outcome: A four-foot-seven, eleven-year-old that was almost 20 pounds overweight.                    I was self-conscious of people constantly staring at my bruises and expanding waistline. My classmates intensified my paranoia by making fun of how I no longer looked the same way I did in pictures. As a result I became more reclusive and reluctant to be placed in situations where I would draw attention to myself.Three years later, things finally started to change when my middle school was invited by our high school\\'s Advanced Drama to go watch a preview of their play. I walked out of the auditorium that day knowing that the people I saw on stage were the people I aspired to be like - confident, fearless, and ambitious.By being a part of the spring musical, I was able to perform alongside the same people I admired for doing what I felt I could never do. The people who inspired my sense of security and love for performing were now the friends I shared inside jokes with. How could I possibly express in a few simple words all they have done for me? Furthermore, how do I say it without bursting into tears? To answer the latter, I did not. I cried like a baby.My experience in Theatre is how I became more comfortable in my own skin. I went from being the girl who could not even introduce herself in class to performing in front of hundreds of people. Theatre has shaped me into a person who is not afraid to stand out and be heard. I took those lessons I learned and went on to compete for the Speech and Debate and Mock Trial Teams, putting myself in the same situations I dreaded in the past. Even though I stopped doing Theater to focus on academics, I did not forget to give back to what had finally made me content with myself. I am ecstatic to know that as the ASB Performing Arts Commissioner, I play a part in making sure that each of the eight performing arts groups on campus function to the best of their abilities so that they can continue to inspire people like me; to inspire people to step outside their comfort zone; to inspire people to become who they want to be. \"}, {\"index\": 682, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]         He appears out of the corner of my eye, running at me as fast as he physically can. He\\'s one of the biggest linemen on the field, so I get nervous, but only for a moment. The mind doesn\\'t play the game; the body does, and training takes control. The massive lineman drops his shoulder ready to level me, but a quick move of my hands and some footwork result in him flying past me while I come through the line relatively unscathed. I\\'m now in the hole, and the quarterback, seeing the path for his running back blocked, keeps the ball and flees in the opposite direction. The quarterback is then crushed by my teammate, and thrown into the air like a ragdoll. The sideline erupts into cheers.It\\'s Spring Ball, we\\'re in Fresno, and it\\'s about ninety degrees out with ninety percent humidity. In full pads and sweating more than I thought was possible to sweat, we have just completed the second practice of the day. As I walk back to our dorms I think about how wet, cold, and clammy my gear is going to be when I put it back on in a few hours for practice number three. After a week we return to Las Vegas. Upon arrival, the acrid smell of molten plastic fills the air, singeing my nostrils. My feet burn on the black turf as the ball is snapped. Enormous men are sprinting towards me. Once again, training takes over and I take one step to the left and run down at the linemen, make my move, attempting to slip through the line. This time I\\'m less successful, and I literally get manhandled: picked up and thrown out of the running back\\'s way. After two hours on the field we head into the weight room where we lift for an additional two hours. I benchpress my own weight five or six times as my spotter\\'s sweat drips off his nose onto my face.     I loved the game, the training, the sweat and work. At my high school, Bishop Gorman, athletics are king: they are the way of life and I immersed myself in that life fully. Our football team is ranked number one in the nation with good reason-- we worked hard. The field is where we, as a school, live, and many of my greatest memories have been made there. Yet, my junior year something changed for me. It was one late summer day after a long practice that the realization hit me, much like a lineman at full force: football was no longer for me. After three years of complete devotion, I finished the season and moved on from football. I no longer felt identified with being a beast on the field; rather, I felt more associated with a mad scientist. I\\'ve blown up my yard more times that I\\'d like to admit. On the first day of spring break I hooked a nine-volt battery up to a solo cup with water and table salt to see if I could produce chlorine gas. I made an attempt at producing a battery out of solo cups, hydrogen peroxide, muriatic acid, copper wire, a magnesium fire starter, and a paper towel soaked in a table salt solution. These were my true passions now and I took action. I created a class that covered material for the Physics 2 AP test because our school didn\\'t offer it.  Where I was once driven by the field, I am now driven by a desire to explore natural laws. Yet, I take the lessons I learned from football, hard work, dedication, and drive into my new home--the chemistry lab. This is the path I want to continue on. This path of discovery, experimentation, and excitement is mine. \"}, {\"index\": 683, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I don\\'t remember ordering or eating fries dipped in oreo McFlurry but the nausea, dizziness, and headache that followed are impossible to forget. It was late July, I was concussed, and I was in the middle of the most blissful three weeks of my life. It was euphoric to return as a counselor to the lakeside YMCA camp where I spent my summers for six years as I was growing up. Camp guided my childhood character development in the same way that an inspiring elderly neighbor might; camp surrounded me with positive role models, forgave my mistakes, and asked me to be happy about cleaning. Camp grew me from a mostly-mute nine-year-old to a fourteen-year-old who recited a love poem to the weather in front of the entire camp while wearing a gorilla suit and a tiara. As a counselor, I wanted to do for the next cohort of middle school aged kids what my counselors had done for prepubescent me.I thrived in the cabin, where I was the junior of two full-time substitute parents for eight lively eleven-year-olds, loving everything from bedtime stories to cabin cleanup. Once I took my campers to \\'raid\\' the ice cream supply in the off-limits-to-campers storage section of the freezer. The homemade bandit masks and a pre-arranged close call with the head cook made the successfully-procured desserts even sweeter.When it was my turn for the dishroom, I came prepared with an upbeat playlist, no idea how to operate the industrial dishwasher, and an unhealthy lack of fear of the giant oatmeal pots. The amount of metal needed to hold 200 stomachs\\' worth of porridge is not insignificant. One afternoon as I was elbows-deep in suds, scrubbing burned cheese from spatulas and lasagna pans, my co-worker reached to put one such pot up to dry and dropped it onto the back of my head. Later that night, after visiting the ER and getting a concussion diagnosis, I felt mentally incompetent to make decisions but was nevertheless allowed to choose the fast food stop. I don\\'t remember choosing McDonalds nor whether the ride there was blurry because of my head or because the co-worker who drove me was speeding. Back at camp, I struggled with the conflict between my pounding head and my urge to be active but finished the week with an even stronger love of camp and a deeper understanding of my own physical limitations. A few weeks ago, I found myself halfway through a four-hour road trip stopping at a McDonald\\'s. I got an oreo McFlurry and ate it with fries dipped in the too-sweet, aggressively chilled ice-milk. It tasted like camp: tears and bliss. \"}, {\"index\": 684, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Several times a week, I find myself contained in a space where cacophonies of sound rise to deafening levels: Clap, Whump, Wap, Thump, KIAI, and yet, this is where I go to seek peace.  I go to this Dojo to practice the Kempo Karate style of martial arts. Kempo is a combination of the essential stances and strikes of Japanese Karate, and the advanced hand techniques of Shaolin Martial Arts.In the Dojo, class begins with five minutes of meditation which serves to release our stress and to build the concentration necessary to the practice of Kata: the choreographed sets of footwork and strikes that teach us to master the techniques of our style in a natural, fluid manner. After Kata, we practice combinations of strikes and kicks with partners, before sparring in intensive bouts. A final meditation fixes lessons learned in the brain.The ancient Shaolin masters observed animal behaviors in combat, many of the moves we practice originated in these observations. Because our style is modernized, our fighting stances are similar to those of boxing, but the animals are still visible in our form. In aggressive, linear attacks I feel a tiger racing for the kill. By entangling limbs and slithering arms into chokeholds, a snake traps its prey. The coiling of energy within my limbs is a crane\\'s fa\\\\u00e7ade of passive stillness before an explosive blow. Despite the confined setting of the dojo, I feel a strong connection with nature.Kempo Karate has taught me to understand the workings of the human body. The correct application of weight can make single strikes devastatingly powerful. Joint locks maneuver the orientation of bones into submission positions. Triangle chokes take advantage of the carotid arteries to suffocate the brain. Leg reaps manipulate balance for takedowns. Conspicuously unguarded regions lure punches and kicks into waiting traps. Because I started at thirteen, no longer a child, I appreciated the philosophy beneath the art.  My instructor often says \\'The circle overcomes the line and the line overcomes the circle.\\' Literally, this is a tip to counter straight strikes with hooks, and counter hooks with straight strikes but figuratively, the saying offers a concise example of the dynamics of martial arts. There is no singular style that will guarantee victory. Constant observation and adaptation are needed to stay on top.I ritualistically follow the maxim \\'See nothing and thus see everything.\\' It seems paradoxical, but I use this rule when sparring: I do not focus on an opponent\\'s fists, feet or eyes; instead, I view an opponent as a whole. I concentrate on changes in the big picture to limit my susceptibility to misdirection and surprise attacks. The \\'See Everything\\' rule is also the basis of my training. I practice a series of choreographed combinations until I\\'ve built sufficient muscle memory to meet any situation.  My mastery of the moves eliminates the need for conscious thought during a rigorous bout \\\\u2013 I reflexively flow into the best move for the situation. Ironically, in the midst of trading blows, I\\'m in a deep mediation \\\\u2013 not thinking, but rather doing what has become natural to me.  \"}, {\"index\": 685, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] 65,700,000.

This is the question that plagues us from early childhood. We are expected even as first graders to have high aspirations, to have a ready-made, prepared answer to this question. I only knew that I wanted to be someone special, someone different. In an immigrant household that stressed practicality above all else, I dreamt of being plucked out of my suburban life and into my fantasy books that featured magical protagonists and daring heroes. I fantasized about jobs that didn\\'t exist\\\\u2014jobs and lives that I could create with my own hands and on my own terms.One day, my second grade teacher sat us all down for our daily reading of a picture book\\\\u2014everyone\\'s favorite time of the day\\\\u2014and we listened, enraptured, as she made the story come alive, a world where animals could talk and the kid always wins. After she finished, I listened, wide-eyed, as she told us this was a career\\\\u2014being a writer. Being a storyteller. People could sell stories for a living.This became my fixation. No matter how impractical or foolish it was, I had found my answer to that nagging question, and I loved it. I collected old notebooks and filled their pages with half-finished stories about heroines who were nothing like me\\\\u2014brave girls with long blonde hair, beautiful and fearless. I lived vicariously through them and somehow, through my fictional worlds, found the courage to be the girl I wanted to be\\\\u2014a girl who spoke her mind, a girl who raised her hand in class, a girl who climbed to the top of the jungle gym. Writing gave me the identity I so craved\\\\u2014a creator of worlds, of meaning, of life.As I grew older, writing, though at first driven by my ever-constant hunger for identity and separation, became the vehicle through which I instead questioned stereotypes and limitations that drove that hunger. From my own experiences as the child of immigrants to the internalized racism that surrounds our past and present, writing became my outlet and voice. Hungrily, I searched for the minority voices outside of my English classes, devoured Junot D\\\\u00edaz and Ocean Vuong, watched them defy generalizations. Fantasy stories with beautiful heroines were not enough; I wanted revolution. I wanted change.

I can easily say my life is the exact opposite. Growing up with a single mom in a large metropolitan city had me facing a great deal of hardships that I had to deal with on my own, which was a struggle, but definitely worth it. All the problems I have faced in my life have brought me to a point where I am able to value my community, as well as the people around me. My position as an individual in society has been blooming into a flower of confidence. The struggles I have faced in my life do not define me, but they have shaped me into becoming the loving, passionate, and fearless person I am today. I grew up as a Russia/Indian child. These two races, being completely different in every aspect, found their unity inside of me. Being raised in such a unique family, I became exposed to many different cultures and ways of living. This gave me the motive to care for the people around me, and, most of all, care for my loved ones. It also taught me that being compassionate and caring towards others will definitely motion them to return the favor. Most of my love is aimed towards my family, who want to see me do spectacular things in life, and my friends, who support and encourage me to take risky paths in order to reach my goal.Most of the time, people do not realize what they feel passionate about, until they actually experience it. My passion for science did not start off on the right foot in the long run. By the third grade, I was sure I would never be able to make it into high school, or even get a good career in biology. However, as the years went on, I realized that making mistakes is part of the learning experience, and I have to believe in myself as well as my ability to excel, in order to achieve. After my awakening, everything was pieced together, and my life started to flow smoothly. Since that time, my passion for science and biology has expanded greatly beyond measure, and I rely on my mistakes to help me grow.Another mistake was made on the day my father left for his homeland in India. This was a very tough day not only for me, but for the loved ones around me as well. For my brother and me, each day after that one grew harder without having him by our side as a father, teacher, or caretaker. I dreamed about the memories we shared on road trips, and dances he taught me to Punjabi music. I began to dread the world, and believed life would never be the same again. However, a year later, I began to realize something very eye opening. All people have troubles in their lives at one time or another, but they learn to find a way to cope with their problems, not hide behind them. This proved to be a very insightful lesson, teaching me to be brave and strong; to shine through in whatever obstacles that get thrown my way. My role as an individual in society has been blooming into a flower of confidence. The struggles I face in my life do not define who I am, but they shape me into being the loving, passionate, and fearless person I am today. Growing up without a father in a populous city had me facing hardships, which at first I believed were impossible to fulfill. Nevertheless, as I faced these hardships, I began to value my community, as well as my loved ones. Many people would be able to say that their lives are, for the most part, basic. I would say mine is extremely extraordinary.  \"}, {\"index\": 687, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'Stephanie? What\\'s the answer?\\' \\'Um\\\\u2026thirty-seven.\\' A familiar flush crept throughout my face. Incredibly, the warmth even spread to my eyes, filling them with inexplicable tears.\\'Great job.\\' The teacher moved on to the next question, blind to my silent dissolution.Throughout my childhood, I was petrified of public speaking; tears pulsed into my eyes whenever I spoke before classes, adults, or crowds. Mortified, I quickly acknowledged public speaking as something at which I could never excel.News came the summer before my freshman year: I had won the International Lu Xun Youth Literature Prize essay contest, and I had been chosen as a speaker to represent all international winners at the awards ceremony in Shanghai. Terrified, I rejoiced. On speech day, I took to the stage, palms sweaty against my skirt, aware of rows of faces arcing above. My hands shook, as did my voice. Sometime during the speech, however, I relaxed infinitesimally; I liked my essay, and it deserved to be read well. When the speech ended, I found my face familiarly flushed but miraculously tear-free. My speech in Shanghai helped me realize that I had hope. Buried beneath layers of self-conscious palm sweat and adrenaline, a public speaker lay within me waiting to be liberated. I recognized my weakness as an opportunity rather than an obstacle; here was a chance to improve myself, to conquer something I once thought impossible.I began seizing chances to push myself out of my comfort zone. At the Governor\\'s Honors Program, I took a class in stand-up comedy, a self-deprecating art that leaves even the confident exposed. Terrified but resolute, I surprised myself by earning a reputation as a deadpan maven who could do a great bit about American cheese. In class, my hand was in the air more often, and I even got excited over in-class speeches. I joined the Lincoln-Douglas debate team and was shocked to win a speaker award at my second tournament. The nerves didn\\'t just dissipate; more often than not, my words were accompanied by a shot of adrenaline straight to the face. However, I found it exhilarating to conquer my fears one answer, one joke, one speech at a time. Through an unlikely marriage of STEM and communication, my leadership roles in FIRST robotics played a pivotal role in the gradual conquering of my greatest fear. I found myself not only designing and programming 120-lb machines, but also networking with executives at events hosted by General Electric and Women in Technology, where I realized that intriguing, passionate people live underneath those suit jackets. Every year, I helped create and deliver the closely-judged presentation for the Chairman\\'s Award, which directly brought our team to World Championships for three consecutive seasons. As the Executive Director, I represented the face of the team; my role entailed televised interviews on Georgia Public Broadcasting and CBS and presentations in front of hundreds of principals to promote STEM programs, something my eight-year-old self would have balked (or maybe bawled) at. I learned to communicate boldly both aloud and on paper, writing articles for the technology column of a local magazine and fusing my passions for software and poetry by publishing a blog. Each reader comment, each principal who decided to fund a new robotics team as a result of my presentation showed me the potency of confident communication. The robotics Executive Director has the honor of giving the last speech at our end-of-year banquet. As I poured my heart out to 100+ parents and students, I noticed one of our mentors dabbing her eyes. She later told me, \\'You\\'re incredibly well-spoken; that speech made me cry.\\' I realized then that the teary-eyed eight-year-old who could not look an adult in the eyes had finally come full circle. Public speaking was no longer my handicap; it had become a tool with which I could evoke tears and laughter, express ideas, and inspire minds. \"}, {\"index\": 688, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Crafting Through Trial and Error     With the red, blue, yellow, and green paper lined up perfectly in symmetrical order, I was finally ready to begin.      My hands were steady as I meticulously aligned the colorful card stock along the cutting board with immaculate precision. Upon cutting the paper, I carefully reached for the hot glue gun, which I would use to attach the pre-cut letters in order. Twenty minutes later, one card was done. I had high standards for the handcrafted cards that I made; every card had to have smooth-cut edges, if it was to be worthy to be sold. Thus, to err was not in my vocabulary.      In my eyes at the age of ten, starting my own small business was my way of proving that I could join my parents in their financial conversations, even if I did lack credibility. What inspired my curiosity was my own family. Growing up, I have always been surrounded by relatives and family members who started their own businesses: my maternal grandfather owned an electronic store; my maternal uncle, a motorcycle shop; my mother, her own travel agency; and my father, his own importing business. In this way, I was exposed to the world of business through my family, who introduced me to a field that piqued my interest.      Selling cards was just one of my many experiences in which I have learned through my hands. Growing up, my mom instilled in me the notion that the only way to learn is through your own hands, and that, \\'You can\\'t be successful unless you have tried and failed.\\' Because of this, my mom allowed me to experiment. At an early age, my parents encouraged me to learn, using a different approach than what most other parents used. Some mothers might disapprove of their children using a hot glue gun at a young age. Not mine. Of course, I did so under close supervision. To my mom, allowing me to embark on my own experience allowed me to inquire about real-life situations that occur: successes and failures. And if I had a question, my mom always had the same answer: \\'You must think about it yourself first.\\' As a child, I resented hearing the same seven words; it was frustrating to say the least. But I soon realized the importance behind my mother\\'s statement. She reiterated this statement so I could critically analyze and apply this same mindset in all aspects of my life, and it is especially applicable to my academics today.          While my card-making business was short lived, from it I have learned to explore the world through trial and error, to adapt myself in situations that present themselves, and to refuse to accept the obvious explanations. I now look back at my experience, with gratitude, for it is the lessons that I have learned from my parents that I build my success. And although my journey into the field of business has just begun, it is a journey that has brought me insatiable curiosity. \"}, {\"index\": 689, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'It\\'s a farewell poem.\\' My Latin teacher says. \\'A propemptikon wishes for a safe and prosperous journey.

I hold back a sigh as I scrawl down the funny little word, propemptikon. Safe journey. Bon-voyage.Something clicks in the back of my mind. I am no stranger to farewell poems. \\'The wind sighs and howls, alas, the Yi river chills.\\' How odd, after so long, when my entire childhood has become blurry snapshots. \\'The hero goes west, never to return.\\' The same meaning, the same short poem, but not the same elegant words.

The characters look much more intimidating than the ones we\\'d been reading in my first-grade class, with so many crisscrossing strokes they resemble ink-splattered pictures. I squint my eyes, but the characters remain frozen, refusing to divulge their secret meaning.

And I think it\\'s time we said good-night.\\'Years later, I would learn about Qin Shi Huang from a World Cultures textbook in an American classroom. I would find a Wikipedia page on Jing Ke. A strange mingling of pride and sadness would overwhelm me when I read the foreign words from a cold computer screen, mere echoes of the story I begged my mother to read night after night, just so I could hear the same two lines of that cryptic poem, before I learned enough characters to read on my own, before I declared Chinese history boring and useless, before I understood the inevitability of journeys.There are no farewell poems when I\\'m nine and watching my mother wave goodbye at the airport terminal, boarding her flight to America, when the lights of Beijing shrink to a bright spot beneath my ascending airplane, six months later. There is no great sense of duty when I close the door of our first home in America to take my mother\\'s hand, our things all packed up in the back of a U-Haul truck. There are no hymns wishing for a safe journey when I leave my second middle school that year; when my father leaves us after another brief visit, to go back home.There is nothing heroic about my journeys across oceans, across states, across a few city blocks to a better neighborhood. I am no great warrior setting out on a doomed mission, but if there\\'s anything I\\'ve learned about journeys, it\\'s not about well wishes and bright hopes but the past I\\'ve left behind. There is nothing poetic about my life as a student, an immigrant, a clich\\\\u00e9d cut-out of the American Dream. I am bound to no one nation, but even as I leave the present to seek a better future, something draws me back to my earliest bedtime stories filled with golden dragons and jade thrones, my ancient heritage brought to life.Now, as I set out on another journey, I begin to write, in a language unfamiliar but beautiful, my very own propemptikon: my farewell poem tracing back over a decade, over entire centuries, to the faded past of my people, leaving nothing behind. \"}, {\"index\": 690, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I was surrounded by the incessant sounds of cars and bikes speeding by, mixing with the equally fast Spanish being spoken behind me. They whirled and swirled in the warm eddies of the wind, picking up other sounds. The cacophony entered my ear and banged on it, demanding to be heard. It was a warm day, one of those days so hot you can smell the heat, the smell I now know to be of metal, rubber, concrete, litter, all burning under the blazing sun. The day was a blur, but I clearly remember the wide streets, tall buildings, everything scaled larger than what I was used to.I was born and have always lived in New York .The earlier part of my childhood was spent in Maspeth, a small neighborhood in Queens. It was an Irish community, full of pubs and inns and Irish delis serving huge delicious breakfasts. My family lived in the only apartment building in the middle of rows of brick houses. An old man used to always boast that the neighborhood was on a plateau, an area that he said only the rich inhabited in the olden times. It was a nice, residential neighborhood, somewhere families like to live in well kept houses and send their children to good public schools and flock to beautiful parks with their families and commute to work. A few years ago, though, I moved to Harlem. Delis were abundant. One could find one on almost every block, each offering the standard fare; cold cuts, hot sandwiches, groceries, beer, ATMs. They ranged from Adalgisa Deli, with its graffiti signage, to Dave\\'s Deli, its neon sign bursting in color and light, its reds and blues and pinks and greens, all emanating light and heat. Someone I remember particularly is a Jamaican man who would sit outside the 125th street subway station, beating his drum and repeatedly chanting \\'Drums over guns\\'. He stood out amidst the streak of homeless sleepers around him and the backdrop of the Duane Reade, an inspired artist among the swarms of commuters. I strolled by him countless times. The first time, he gave me a momentary stare, lasting only a second but definitely a stare, a deep look, to take in an anomaly from the norm, that was repeated by many others. But I soon became one of the many pedestrians he saw every day. The distance I felt when I first came to Harlem eroded, as I slowly understood the neighborhood and became accustomed to many things. The warm sweet smell of toasting bolillos would greet me every time I exited the heavy air of the subway. I would often buy one, savoring every sweet bite of the twisted bread.The melody of Puerto Rican tunes blasting from radios attached to bikes rang in my ears as I slowly took the ten minute walk home.Today, I walk past the mural on 103rd street. The bright spray paint, holding out against the encroaching vines and blackening bricks, still gives advice to young people. I pass Jefferson Houses. Some soul thought of naming the projects after the presidents, as if the decaying buildings would be lifted up with their esteemed names. A man is talking to himself, another has brought a TV outside, the wire delicately dangling through his window. Two kids are holding a dog, trying to re-attach the leash that came off when he ran after the car that was too fast for him.I walk down the hill on 100th street, remembering the hills of Maspeth. Only these are different. These are the hills of Harlem, the hills of my adolescence. \"}, {\"index\": 691, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?My hand scrambled across the page of my linear algebra test as I struggled to finish.15 minutes left until the test is over.How do I find the orthogonal projection of a vector onto a plane?10 minutes left.I need to find the vector normal to the plane!5 minutes left.How do I get the normal vector?3 minutes left.I can\\'t find the normal vector!2 minutes.Okay, forget that problem. I need to move on. Problem 4, part e.1 minute.I still haven\\'t answered half of this test! What do I do?My teacher started to collect the test on the side of the room opposite to me. As he walked around the classroom, Ithrew random vectors and matrices onto the paper. When the teacher came to my desk, I scribbled my name onthe test and handed it in.I just failed that test.As my body made its way to the next class, APUSH, my mind refused to budge from linear algebra.Why didn\\'t I work faster? What\\'s wrong with me?Come on, salutary neglect. That was the British policy of governing the colonists.I\\'m a lazy slob.After the British abandoned salutary neglect, the colonists got angry.I hate myself.When APUSH ended, I dragged my feet out the door and toward the residence halls. I could spend my free periodhidden in my dorm, crying alone. The moment I stepped through my door, tears erupted from my eyes.You\\'re a worthless piece of meat.You failed that test.You brought this on yourself.Stop crying.You\\'re pathetic.After what seemed like an eternity, I composed myself enough to go to English. When that class ended, myEnglish teacher asked me what was wrong, and I explained what had happened. He said, \\'Selen, one action doesnot define you as a person. You\\'re a thoughtful, intelligent person. And the sooner you recognize that, the better.\\'Though I didn\\'t want to admit it to myself right then, I eventually realized that I needed to calm down and take astep back from the situation.It turned out that I wasn\\'t the only person who performed badly on that test\\\\u2014everyone in the class did. My linearalgebra teacher decided to give everyone an additional twenty minutes to work on the test. He let us see ouroriginal grades\\\\u2014I had scored a 44/100\\\\u2014and he gave us two days to study for our second chance. I learned theconcepts that I had struggled with on my first try. And after my second go at the test, I earned a 96.I learned that my true failure that day wasn\\'t how I answered problems on a sheet of paper. That day, I failed torecognize my own worth. In the heat of the moment, I forgot every positive thing about myself and saw only thenegatives. Over time, I learned to accept bad grades on tests. Though I did well on my second try on that lineartest, I had plenty of opportunities to learn to accept worse than expected performance in my other classes. Eachtime I didn\\'t do as well as I had hoped, I tried to take a look at the bigger picture, and I tried to think about howmuch that grade would matter in the overall scheme of things. I\\'d accept that I probably didn\\'t know the material aswell as I should have, and I\\'d look over my notes again. But after reviewing, I would let it go, knowing that the badgrades didn\\'t define me. I struggled to do this at first, but over time, it became much easier to let it go. At the endof my junior year, I managed to do what would have been impossible for me at the beginning, accept a B+ (Gasp!)as a final grade in English. \"}, {\"index\": 692, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  Blump. That\\'s the sound of a lethargic dive. First comes the immersion then comes the shock. The frigid water serves as a defibrillator shocking me to life. I inhale only to be reminded of Colorado mornings: the piercing 40 degree air. Only then am I awake enough to decipher the all too familiar surroundings. The sun still sleeps as my alarm blasts the lyrics to an old Taylor Swift song. I squint at the neon-green numbers flashing 4:55 AM. I give myself five minutes to groan and grovel before I get up to feed my inexplicable addiction. I toss my worn out duffel bag into the car and make the desolate drive to morning practice. I, among the seven other swimmers, change into our still-damp speedos and sprint into our makeshift glacial lake. My childhood and the water were inseparable. I spent my summers with my grandparents on the beach. They would watch as I ran into the waves with my oversized orange life jacket. Sometimes I would drift with the ocean; other times I would desperately swim against the waves. My love for the water only grew with each summer. So, naturally I joined my high school swim team.  But I never envisioned myself as just an athlete. I love swimming not for the aerodynamic dive or the rush of adrenaline or the split second turns, but the time to think. Even though I\\'m in the heart of a two hour practice, this is my time away from the multivariable linear algebra test I took that morning or the Physics lab due the next day. This is my sanctuary, my oasis of serenity away from regular life; this is the time to let my mind drift with the waves. Only then do I realize there are two whale emojis on the iPhone for a reason, and only then do I realize LA Times might not have the best traveling advice. Only then do I realize what I can do to change the world. Swimming is the next stroke, the next kick, the 25 yards that lie ahead. Swimming is the desire to compete, the thirst to win; it is the unwavering will to crash against the waves.  Swimming is embracing the pain and discovering new strengths in myself. Swimming is the understanding that a single stroke could mean the difference between victory and defeat, greatness and mediocrity. Now, a mere three years later, I understand that the triple practice days and sleep deprivation is no longer the exception but the expectation. I understand that swimming is pushing beyond the limit. I understand that the years of training all prepared me for that one dive, one turn, one race. And I understand that swimming is preparing me for the next stroke of life.  And as of now, before the sun comes up, I\\'d like to take advantage of the many laps that lie ahead. \"}, {\"index\": 693, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  It seems like I have spent most of my free time trying to fly away from home. And that\\'s because, well, I have. I caught the travel bug long ago, compelling me to explore. Since the age of six, when I stuck my face into a tidepool to say hello to my new friend, an octopus, on a black-sand beach in New Zealand, I haven\\'t stopped seeking adventures in far-away places.There was always something disquieting about the unquestionable fact that ten months a year I lived in Upper Dublin, suburban Philadelphia\\\\u2014a town more acquainted with Whole Foods than entertaining the idea of what wholesome food means. If I had to spend another year getting asked, \\'What grade did you get on our Biology quiz?\\' I thought I would go insane.So, the fall semester of sophomore year I left the homogeneity of suburban life behind and ventured to Idaho to attend the Alzar School. There, I met nine students with whom I would share icy river crossings, pre-dawn trail breakfasts, and spontaneous soccer matches. Traversing Pacific Northwest mountains and Patagonian plains, we relied on each other not only for food and firewood, but also for coaching on harrowing ascents, songs for that last grueling mile, and companionship each night in our tents. I embraced the calamity of wild thunderstorms and soggy sleeping bags. I shrieked with joy when, despite complete trepidation as a beginner kayaker, I attempted an ominous class IV rapid, flipped over and swam through thrashing waves to emerge alive. With the backcountry as our classroom, we wore our shoulder and hip bruises like glory battle scars, indicators of our tenacity and ability, not weakness. I asked myself why I would eagerly rise at dawn to rig 18 kayaks to the back of a truck\\\\u2014and found my answer: this was one way I could contribute to my community.I tasked my ears with listening to the world\\'s voices, teetering through the challenges of language barriers and differing opinions. I questioned the most fundamental parts of my views about education, community, and nature. And most important, I realized that exploration is not an experience where I escape my life; exploration is a mindset that I must embrace in order to fully live within my communities, making active decisions that are in accord with my beliefs.To me, living with intention means moving forward consciously. Despite my previously sworn hatred of the suburban bubble, I have come to love my life in this place, Upper Dublin. Seeking out opportunities to engage my interests, I build community in my little suburb. I take my friends over to our CSA farm, we pick vegetables and cook up some fine vegan cuisine, while debating the value of locally-sourced food. I plan camping trips for a Girl Scout troop, sharing my enthusiasm for the outdoors and sustainable environmental practices. Through Catalyst for Success, we partner with Title-I schools for hands-on science demonstrations to spark kids\\' curiosity for STEM. Piece-by-piece we build a community where everyone can learn and grow. I found my place in the last place I ever expected. It didn\\'t change, but my approach towards it did.My suburban town certainly doesn\\'t offer the Rio Claro\\'s crystal clear waters, or the opportunity to hear a Quechuan talk about the impact of dam construction in Chile. Here, I\\'m unlikely to learn how to make origami kimonos from a kindly Japanese lady with creased hands and a toothy smile. I can\\'t savor, straight off the tree, the most scrumptious plantains, or witness a bear cub being chased around our Alaska campground by a hatchet-wielding lunatic in SpongeBob boxers. But these things don\\'t end in my hometown. Instead, I realize, they\\'re manifest in this wondrous thing called life. So whether life takes me around the world or around the block, I\\'m determined to explore every aspect of it.  \"}, {\"index\": 694, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] From the 1970s to 1980s, it was more important for two children to help their family make at least $2 a day than to learn how to find the derivative of a function or study evolution. The focus, at the time, was to be able to live each day with enough money to feed a family of fifteen and six. The Khmer Rouge caused my mother to be born into a broken environment without the proper food and nutrients a baby needs. It caused my father to lose his two eldest brothers and escape to a temporarily-adopted family in Thailand that made him work to live. Both of my parents have worked since the age of eight without thinking of needing an education. They continue to work now in hopes that their children wouldn\\'t have to worry and suffer like they did. My mother barely received an education in Cambodia until she came to America at the age of 22 to learn English. My father had only received an elementary-leveled education in Cambodia and had to start sophomore year in America without knowing English and any prerequisites. Throughout high school, he had difficulties studying due to dyslexia and had trouble retaining the information. With some frustrations, he was able to earn his high school diploma.\\'Study hard to get good education.\\'\\'We work hard so you don\\'t have to.\\' \\'You have opportunity to get education.\\'I come from a family that stresses the importance of education because they didn\\'t get the same luxury. Throughout my life, I heard the same phrases over and over again, said in broken English. But that was all the support I received. They didn\\'t have the ability to help me with homework past third grade. Once I got home from school, I was on my own. There wasn\\'t anybody that I could ask for clarification on homework or to explain a problem when I was home. I had to practice and study the new material by myself with constant reminders from my parents about how lucky I was to receive some formal education and how gruesome their lives were in Cambodia and Thailand. Those reminders were all I needed for me to strive to be my best. Like any other child, I aimed to make my parents proud. I wanted to show them that all their hard work wasn\\'t for nothing. Even as I\\'m in my final year of high school, they still reiterate for me to complete my homework and to get A\\'s. Throughout elementary and middle school, I aimed to get straight A\\'s every year and to be successful in my parents\\' eyes. When I entered high school, my educational goal shifted from getting straight A\\'s to becoming valedictorian. As my goal slowly approaches, I still remember the stories of the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia, and my parents. I remind myself how fortunate I am to go to a career and technical academy and obtain an extensive education while I work my way to be valedictorian. \"}, {\"index\": 695, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 696, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 697, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Allow me to preface this by explaining that I have grown up in the theater. I have been hit with pangs of tragicreality and swept away by fantastical tales in black boxes more times than I can count. I love stepping out of myown mind for a short hour and a half or so to be immersed in the complex stories of other personalities andperspectives to work out my own inquiries about the human experience. When I encountered a musical workcalled Next to Normal about a family much like my own, I had to face a character I thought I\\'d never encounter onthe Great White Way: myself.My situation is frighteningly similar to that portrayed in Next to Normal, where a teenage girl, Natalie, must contendwith her mother\\'s psychological breakdown over her brother, Gabriel\\'s, death \\\\u2013 a tragedy that preceded her birth.Much in the same way, I am an only child, but not by design. My brother, Christopher Steven Owings, was born onDecember 17, 1996. Like Gabriel, his name was specifically chosen for its connection to a holy figure \\\\u2013 SaintChristopher, a Christian martyr killed in third century Rome. This beautiful little baby boy with thick black hairbrought nothing but joy to my parents, but his diagnosis with tuberous sclerosis, a disease that causes usuallybenign tumors to form in the body, brought this happiness to a grinding halt. While this disorder is not usually fatal,it unexpectedly took my big brother\\'s life six months later on July 7, 1997.I grew up loved, adored, and initially unaware of the toll that my brother\\'s loss took on my parents. But I couldalways sense it \\\\u2013 his birthday and death anniversary let gloom prevail in our household, and my mother wasinconsolable whenever she encountered a baby boy with dark hair just like Christopher\\'s. He was always presentin my life. When I was in preschool, I would tell my parents that Christopher sat on my bed at night as my guardianangel. However, as I grew up, my feelings towards his memory morphed into resentment for bringing perpetualsadness to our family. I\\'d find my mother in tears early in the morning, overwhelmed by a sudden storm of despairrelated to his passing. I figured I could soften this pain by developing an ambitious spirit at an early age. I alsoreasoned that if I could achieve a substantial amount of accolades, I could rise above all of this pain instead ofdealing with my own grief, or at least that was my intention. In the words of Natalie, metaphorically, I vowed to\\'play \\'til the strings or my fingernails break.\\' Through musical theater, I could assign meaning to my unsettledemotions while temporarily blinding myself to the pain through the cacophony of praise for my heartfeltperformances.I was instantly mesmerized by Next to Normal. However, the full extent of the show\\'s message didn\\'t strike a chordin me until the last night of the performance, which was the first time I confronted my own grief as the powerfulscore broke through my usually imperturbable composure. As a woeful sob welled up within me, I finally tappedinto my personal heartache over my big brother\\'s death and felt it wash over me like a torrential rain. Even thoughI can only imagine my mother\\'s pain in all its entirety, I got a better insight into the hell through which she livesevery day and more respect for her sanity in the face of tragedy, a deviation from the musical\\'s plot. The best artteaches us what we already know, which makes it all the more powerful. Next to Normal was a light unto my feet,not a grief-ridden setback, on the path towards my own self-discovery, strengthening my love for my family.After all, amidst the darkness, there will be light. \"}, {\"index\": 698, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] This past summer, I saw my grandmother for the first time in six years. She hugged me, looked me straight in the eye and said cheerfully, \\'My husband says that you are his friend, so now we are friends too, nice to meet you!\\'My mind blanked and all I wanted to do was run away and cry.But looking past my grandmother\\'s shoulder, I saw the red rimmed eyes of my grandfather begging me to play along. So I let out a hoarse laugh while tipping my head back and forced the tears back down.A large majority of my childhood memories include my grandmother, and I looked up to her optimistically powerful nature. I wanted to grow up and be just like her.So when she broke out into an uncontrollable violent outburst six summers ago on a humid afternoon in Taiwan, I was shocked and miserable.I was in the kitchen when I heard screaming and furniture falling. Running into the living room, I saw my grandfather standing statue-still in a t-shirt damp with sweat. My grandmother was slapping his face, screaming. I cried and begged her to stop. She turned and glared at me with eyes of fiery hatred. The only other thing I remember from that day was that for the first time in my life, I could not tell my tears apart from water in the shower.I did not want to know my grandmother\\'s problems unless they could be fixed, so I told my parents that I didn\\'t care. Years went by without a word of her. The only thing I knew was that she was not dead.The thought of my grandmother became my greatest fear that I forced myself to avoid because I could not bear the helplessness and confusion that came with the thought of her.I lived in oblivion until one day in sophomore year when I walked in on a call between my father and grandfather. It lasted for ten seconds, but I left the room choking back tears. My grandmother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\\'s and no longer remembered me. She was alive and physically healthy, but I had lost her.It took me a year and a half to process this, and to this day, I am still unable to confidently say that I have come to terms with this reality. The overwhelming feelings I felt in the shower six years ago still exist, just with a spark of hope that comes with researching about Alzheimer\\'s.In February of junior year, I was accepted into a summer program in Taiwan. My grandfather responded happily, but also asked for the address of where I would be staying so he could visit with my grandmother. For the next four months, I mentally prepared myself for this visit.By facing the truth and making myself think about the uncomfortable distance I had created by not reaching out to my grandmother, I realized that it was not too late to face her.Two days after my program ended, I went to dinner at my grandparents\\'. The walls were lined with my baby pictures, but my grandmother did not seem to make the connection that that little girl was standing right in front of her.Even though it was difficult, that was the most memorable meal of my trip; I had confronted the greatest fear I was avoiding in my life.I can no longer connect with my grandmother emotionally, but I have rediscovered the incredibly respectable attitude that my grandfather has through the way he approaches the deterioration of my grandmother\\'s memory. He inspires me, allowing me to understand the importance of accepting the truth that irresolvable problems do exist. He has taught me to stop being afraid to show that I care and to take action so I never again have to end up crying alone in the dark. \"}, {\"index\": 699, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Growing up in the city, perhaps The City, I have always been surrounded by technology. Everywhere I turn, I see people with their heads buried in their phones, anxiously awaiting their next text or frantically typing out a response to the one they just received. As unfortunate as it is, often I am one of those people, bustling down the street with barely a clue about what is going on mere feet from me. Perhaps that\\'s why my first hike, a four-day trek through the Catskills on a trail aptly named Devil\\'s Path, made such an impact on me. For the first time in my life, I was completely isolated from technology. I may have only been three hours away from my New York City home, less than one hour away from the campgrounds at which I was spending the summer, but without the comfort of my cell phone, or even a streetlight illuminating the path ahead of me, I might as well have been on another planet. \\'I can\\'t go on any further,\\' panted one of my hiking companions, another boy who had never been in an environment remotely similar to the forests of the Catskill Mountains, barring a Bronx Zoo exhibit. We had only been hiking for an hour, but he was exhausted. The thirty pounds on his back had taken their toll, physically and emotionally, prompting him to collapse onto the nearest boulder, struggling for breath. Witnessing our comrade\\'s pain, the rest of us crowded around him, slightly annoyed but eager to help, despite feeling the beginnings of fatigue ourselves. When it became clear that he could not continue without support, another camper and I propped ourselves underneath his shoulders and, until his strength returned, lent our bodies to him to use as crutches. Thus began our journey over seven mountains and across thirty miles of the least welcoming terrain I have ever encountered. The physical stress of the walk, however, paled in comparison to the preparation we had to put in once we would arrive at our destination for the night. The sun would only grace us with its rays for so long before disappearing over the edge of the nearest peak, the flashlights we had brought did more to attract mosquitoes than they did to guide us in the darkness that followed, and the nightly downpour made us yearn for the day\\'s sweltering heat. Thus, we had minimal time to set up our shelters, filter the river water with which to refill our twenty-four-ounce metallic canisters, and gather wood for the fire that would play the role of the microwave when it came time to heat our dinner. Working independently to complete the tasks by nightfall would have been infeasible, but by dividing the labor and collaborating, we were able to erect our tents and serve a meal with just enough time to enjoy the stunning sunset. Although that hike will forever have a place in my heart, the Catskill Mountains are far from my ideal surroundings. All of us depend on technology, and we must harness its full potential to consistently push the boundaries of progress. But nor is the modern city, where technology has gone from a tool to an addiction, its pervasive influence causing people to ignore those around them, the type of environment where I will best thrive.  Cooperation is the key factor in determining my perfect place. The sense of camaraderie on the hike was unlike any I have encountered in everyday life. City people are so engrossed in technology, so captivated by the ability it grants us to work individually, that we tend to forget how to interact with fellow humans, a skill essential for progress. If we can regain that ability, hone those communication skills, and put technology back in its place as a tool for human progress, we will have the ideal conditions for societal advancement. \"}, {\"index\": 700, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] At a restaurant in the middle of Manhattan, my phone buzzes with an impending FaceTime call from my sister. Disobeying a typical dinner table courtesy, I slide my finger across the screen at the approval of my parents. \\'Hi, sissy-ka-doo,\\' I say to the face that is a bit too close to the camera. \\'Hi sissy-poo,\\' my 20-year-old sister replies. Our untraditional nicknames stem from a very imaginative past, full of games in which we would pretend to be fairies, mermaids, or international super spies. The peculiar aspect of my relationship with my \\'sissy-ka-doo\\' is that it has not matured with time in a conventional way. When my sister turned 10, she stopped aging cognitively. I, however, did not.Nicole does not appear to be my older sister.  She stands a foot shorter than me, still retains baby fat in her face, and manifests the mental capabilities of a child half her age. When we were young girls, Nicole was like any other kid to me. Around the fifth grade, I finally understood the meaning of the medical phrase my mom tossed around; Down\\'s Syndrome made my sister different. Slowly, I shifted into the role of the older sister, despite being three years younger, feeling the need to mature at an accelerated pace. In high school, I have taken on more adult responsibilities such as supervising her bedtime routines, assisting her in preparing her meals, and driving her to her obligations.Nicole has contributed to my psychological makeup in subtle ways. I have become Nicole\\'s helper, mentor, and advocate, and she admires and emulates me. I adore Nicole, but, compounded by her stubborn streak, experiences with her have been a struggle at times. However, they have also contributed to my becoming an empathetic person with exceptional levels of patience. This quality is most evident in my efforts to tutor her in math, a subject she fails to understand without continuous assistance. The skills I have developed through helping Nicole have readily translated to my work, where I teach children swimming skills, and to school, where I serve as a student tutor. Nicole challenges me because she will never learn as I do , but interacting with her has taught me how to adjust to the various learning styles of others.  I will never give up on trying to help Nicole succeed. I foster her desires to study creative writing by reading poetry to her and assisting in her composition endeavors.  On a daily basis, I actively encourage Nicole to develop independent living skills, which are far less appealing to her. As hard as my family and I try to promote Nicole\\'s independence, she will unlikely be capable of living on her own. Most parents find freedom when their children reach eighteen, but mine will not. I have and will always play a pivotal role in the care of Nicole, hopefully allowing my parents to experience the freedom a more traditional family would have. However, this will not be a burden to me; Nicole\\'s disability does not change the way I love her.We share a FaceTime call in a rare moment of separation as she is at sleep-away camp and I am on vacation. When I leave for college, it will be strange but ultimately healthy for Nicole and me to experience life without one another.  For now, my sister stares at me with her loving brown eyes as she relays details of her day at camp. I tell her how my day went, detail by detail (\\'You would have loved the goat cheese gnocchi!\\') and proceed to make funny faces at her while she laughs uncontrollably. Her camp buddy tells her it is time for lights out, so she blows me a kiss. I catch hers and blow my own, telling her I cannot wait to talk to her tomorrow.\\'Goodnight sissy-ka-doo.\\'\\'Goodnight sissy-poo.\\' \"}, {\"index\": 701, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  There were plenty of places I thought I\\'d be by the time I was sixteen. In school? Definitely. Working at my temple? Sure, no problem. But sitting in my bathroom with a box of purple hair dye, watching in the mirror as my mother carefully painted it onto my hair? That hadn\\'t quite been on the agenda. Somehow, there I was, with the sickly-sweet smell of Splat! Lusty Lavender filling my nose as I tried to rub the dye off my ear. Little did I know where that purple hair would lead. I was always a quiet kid. I read my geometry textbook under the desk in algebra, wrote a couple of articles with my best friend for the middle school newspaper, and generally didn\\'t talk much outside my group of friends. Sure, I had ideas\\\\u2014\\'We should learn to code! Wouldn\\'t it be cool to build a catapult out of toothpicks? Maybe we should spend less time looking up shoes online during newspaper meetings.\\'\\\\u2014but I kept them to myself. By the time high school rolled around, I\\'d been in classes with the same students for nine years. I thought I was stuck, doomed to be the shy girl in the corner with her books. This, I realized, wouldn\\'t do; I wanted more.  So, during freshman year, I started working my way out of my shell. In journalism class, when my teacher mentioned that the school newspaper needed someone who knew their way around InDesign, I raised my hand and mentioned that I had some experience with the software. Soon enough, I was working with the layout editor, worming my way into editorial discussions, and trying to get my input into the paper. I was still scared\\\\u2014the editor in chief was a rather intimidating senior, and I wasn\\'t used to speaking my mind. The next year, to my surprise, I was promoted to managing editor. I was glad to have a more important role to play, but still felt that something was holding me back. But I thought about it and realized that even though I was surrounded by the same people I\\'d known for years, it didn\\'t mean I had to be the same person they had known for years. I started to hatch a plan\\\\u2014a plan to become the person I wanted to be, and it all started with some purple hair dye, purchased from CVS for $10.49. I\\'ll admit, my first day in school with a purple head of hair was terrifying. There were baffled looks, half-finished questions, and several astonished gasps. All the same, I liked it. I loved it, actually. I know\\\\u2014it\\'s just hair. But as a result of this drastic change in my appearance, I stand out from the crowd. My hair has forced me to draw attention to myself and keep it there, and I\\'m finally able to be the person I\\'ve always wanted to be\\\\u2014the one who shares her ideas, isn\\'t afraid of change or of making mistakes, and contributes to the things she cares about. At the end of sophomore year, I submitted an application for the position of editor in chief of the newspaper. I had a lot to say, and I was no longer afraid to say it. I didn\\'t think I would actually get the job, but I was willing to put myself out there and make the case for why I was the most qualified. To my surprise, I got an email from our advisor congratulating me. I was the first junior to be appointed editor in chief in the newspaper\\'s history, and I was ready for it\\\\u2014 purple hair and all. \"}, {\"index\": 702, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Two broken brushes and an empty spray bottle of water later, I am left with a less than curly, more than straight, brown mane. I turn to my mom\\'s drawer of worn-away labels of mostly expired, nearly empty bottles of ancient hair products. I conclude that a concoction of \\'Smoothing Serum,\\' \\'3 Minute Miracle Straight,\\' and a hodgepodge of other nameless formulas will do the trick. I pour the array of styling formulas into an empty bottle and immediately become nauseous from the fake watermelon and flower scent cascading from the bottle. But beauty is pain, and I\\'ve been told straight hair is beauty. I dump copious amounts of the cottage cheese textured mixture into the palm of my hand and begin sliding the mixture from root to end as instructed by one of the few, still readable labels. Unlike the pin straight locks that I had been promised, I still had a frizzy but now greasy mess. Similar to trying to remove the wrinkles from a shirt using friction from one\\'s hand, trying to remove curls from a mess of hair is nearly impossible. But the \\'hair hate\\' of a seven year old girl with curly hair is inconsolable. This struggle continued for five years until I discovered something that would not only change my hair\\'s texture, but my views of myself: the hair straightner. I sit on the cold tile floor eagerly awaiting my new flowing locks. It takes two hours and two twelve year old girls to tame an unruly mop of spiraled tendrils, but eventually I am told to close my eyes and stand up. I shoot up and shake my head as if in a shampoo commercial, expecting this strange movement to transform me into the beauty I always wanted to be. To no avail. I look in the mirror and see the same rosy cheeked, pre-pubescent girl with braces staring back. Unlike every other time though, my hair is flat, dull and boring. However, I run a brush through my hair, a luxury only afforded to those born with straight hair, and assume that I truly did appear transformed. The following morning, I roll out of bed at the usual 7:50, run my fingers through my hair, and apply a generous coat of lip gloss, ready for a day of stares and compliments. As I board a bus of eager eyes, I get a few looks but nothing to the extent that I had been hoping. I strut into my first period class and look for my friends as I had every day for seven months. Just before the bell, my teacher, Mrs. Weatherill, comes over, scrunches her face, and informs me that I \\'have come to the wrong class\\' and that she would be \\'happy to help me find where I should be going.\\' I turn to her in shock as my friends break down in uncontrollable laughter. Realizing her mistake, Mrs. Weatherill apologizes, walks away, and tells the class to take a seat. Mortified, I throw my hair into a bun, hoping that no one would remember my \\'transformation\\' from the Anna I was to the Anna I wanted to be. As I have grown up, my hair has grown out. My hair still affects how I see myself, but now, it no longer drips hair hate, but instead, hair curling products. The crazier my hair becomes, the more I feel comfortable in my own skin. It holds the insecurities that I had but also the confidence that I have found. My curls are no longer the feature that makes me stick out, but rather stand out. I find that hiding from the rain and answering the ever constant \\'how do you get your hair to do that?\\' are small prices to pay for the ability to be who I am. \"}, {\"index\": 703, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I sit anxiously as I wait for the light to turn from red to green. Anticipation consumes me as I clench my hands around the steering wheel, prepared for the hard left turn that comes after the start/finish straight. The vibration of the twin engine that sits about five inches behind my seat shakes my whole kart. I can hear the spilling rain slam against the asphalt and my helmet and I can feel its moisture covering my hands. As I wait, I go through the track in my head, moving my body to the left and to the right, as my mind speeds through each corner. The red light turns green. I slam my foot against the accelerator. I can already feel the kart losing grip on the track. I have to fight the kart to keep it on the track because the tires can\\'t grip to the drenched asphalt. It\\'s as if I am racing on ice. I can hardly see what is ahead of me since my visor is covered in water, so I have to constantly check my surroundings in case anyone challenges me. The wind that comes with the speed I am going pushes the water off of my visor, but it is raining so hard that rain continually pours back on. I work from memory of the track and visualize what is next in my head. I know when the kart kisses the apex when I feel the distinct vibration from the tires bouncing of the grooved surface of each corner. Just as every time I raced before, my heart beats out of my chest as I focus on the racing line and the next driver ahead. But this time, my mind is also fixated on the daunting rain that continues to cascade onto the track. This is the first time I have gone racing in the rain.  Rain is one of the most technically demanding conditions a driver can race in. This is especially true for karts, which I have been racing since I was 12. The karts are light, so they are highly susceptible to any forces that come their way. This means that when it rains the karts can spin off at any moment, which poses a challenge for drivers. However, as a driver who knows that racing is a dangerous sport even when the weather is dry, racing in the rain is glorious. I welcome the rain. I see it as a challenge that I must overcome in order to become a better driver. When the weather is dry, I am constantly driving on the limit, pushing all boundaries in order to get the fastest lap times and overtake anyone in my way. But when the rain comes, more of my mind is occupied by trying to keep the kart on the track, rather than make it go around the track as fast as possible. I constantly fight the rain for control of the kart all while I continue to fight the other drivers for the top spot on the podium. Racing in the rain is extremely difficult to master, but once it is mastered, it is considered an art form, where the painter (the driver) uses his brush (the kart) to paint (to race) on the canvas (the track). This is because a master of racing in the rain must use intricate moves to both keep his kart on the track and drive faster than anyone else. A master and his kart work in unison. I am nowhere near a master, but after that first day of racing in the rain, I have been fascinated with the art ever since. My goal is to be the best driver I can be, and racing in the rain will help me achieve that goal by teaching me how to push the limits when nature is pushing back against me.  \"}, {\"index\": 704, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] To be honest, I had signed up for Science Olympiad on a whim. It was the type of thing my parents had always pushed me toward, but I still felt a nudge of uncertainty: was I willing to commit my future to science? I needed some sign from the universe\\\\u2026A voice behind me. It was her: \\'Hey. Do you need a partner?\\'**Rewind. It\\'s freshman year. I\\'m speeding through the hallway, a blur of electric pants and overstuffed backpack, reciting Pablo Neruda\\'s poem \\'Final\\' in Spanish at lightning speed. Rocket launch in math class tomorrow.

We go to the same summer camp!\\' Of course I know her. Everyone does. She is a mystical being, the Athena of the senior class. She\\'s the one designing our STEM building, the one who does godlike scientific research outside of class. How does she know my name? In her gray eyes, I\\'m just another mortal. \\'I saw you on the Science Olympiad roster. Event signups are next week.\\' I emphatically nod and walk away in awe. **After months of practice, the materials science event finally arrives. I\\'m sitting in a lab bench, coat and goggles on, feeling frustrated that I don\\'t know what\\'s going on. As I build a polymer model out of marshmallows and toothpicks, I silently watch her breeze through the question packet. I have no clue what\\'s going on, but that\\'s what draws me in. I snap out of Tally\\'s hypnotic siren song; my toothpick snaps, and some marshmallows appear to be frowning at me. Without her year of AP Chemistry, I would\\'ve been lost at sea. I\\'m bringing her down, but we have three events left, and turning back is no longer an option. That afternoon, I come home with a tired smile, a couple of ribbons, and a sudden realization.Tally--this spiritual force--had led me to Charybdis, which had sucked me down with the sea and vomited me back up with the rest of the Ithacans. I emerged a captive of science, stuck on Calypso\\'s island with Odysseus even after Tally escaped our prison and sailed for college. I craved knowledge--classes,  TED Talks, Cell magazine. Through the hopeful queries sent to research laboratories, the disappointing rejections, the exhilarating first acceptance, Tally was there for me. After my first month at lab, I knew one thing: I was passionate about science. I wanted to spend my life exploring, and I didn\\'t want to take a preconceived path. Instead, I want to keep island hopping, to learn the intricacies of biotechnology, to engineer plant imaging systems, to battle antibiotic resistance. Each time I land on these islands, I don\\'t know what monster I\\'ll face, what problems I\\'ll need to solve. After all, science is inherently ambiguous; the more I learn about it, the more I know what I don\\'t know. This is my problem, yet I embrace it.Fast forward to senior year. I\\'m speeding through the hallway, my backpack still chock full, my pants still pretty bright; my eyes, even brighter. But now, I\\'m the one with the kick in my step, the constant drive to reach the next part of my hero\\'s journey. Now I\\'m the one sitting in front of a bunch of nervous freshmen carrying brand-new copies of The Odyssey in their backpacks, ready to push them past the threshold of their own journey. \\'Hey guys, I\\'m Allison, your senior leader this year.

And then, I couldn\\'t.It was my third International Mathematical Olympiad. From my first day in math camps, I dreamt of bringing at least a silver medal to Bangladesh. For that end, I solved all types of problems I encountered, not only geometry, which was a trend in our training camps and advised even by our trainers. I practiced combinatorics and number theory by myself. As per my plan, I had a bronze in my second Olympiad, as the youngest Bangladeshi.And then, in my third IMO, I missed two easy points in a problem. I still scored highest in my team, but for those points, I missed what I yearned for so long.I was morose, but I couldn\\'t afford to lose focus. I had only one year left, and as Bangladeshi students had to face largest public examination HSC about a month before IMO, rarely anyone could improve their score even a little in last year without ruining their HSC result.I kept both in mind - and I synchronized the practice time. Whatever free time I had from one, I practiced another. I challenged myself with increasingly harder problems, then spent nights solving them. I collaborated with teammates and friends abroad through online forums, and even taught classes in the camp to corroborate my knowledge.My last IMO came, and despite losing two points again, I scored better. When I went to the stage to receive my silver medal, I knew everything was alright. \"}, {\"index\": 706, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 707, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] When I was seven, I started my own business. It wasn\\'t the next Amazon, but for me, my lemonade stand was a serious enterprise. Each Saturday morning I ventured into the sun to search our backyard for lemons to sacrifice for my amazing lemonade. My hands would burn from the hours of cutting, slicing, and juicing, but I loved the repetitiveness of the process and the time I spent alone. Once it was mixed, I pulled my red, rusted wagon, to the nearby park and set up my stand in the grass. The hardest part was not the hours prepping, but instead, the time with customers. \\'How much?\\' a neighbor would ask. \\'One dollar,\\' I\\'d meekly reply. The problem: I\\'m an introvert. I loved spending time alone planning my business, but dreaded interacting with people. While my shyness hindered my success, I didn\\'t admit failure. With my early profits, I returned to my garage and created \\'Britney\\'s Lemony Libations\\' t-shirts, signs, and business cards, then tucked a new, red wagon under a yellow umbrella. I hired my gregarious cousin, Bryden, to be my sole employee. Last, I developed a pricing strategy that worked: if I priced my lemonade at 75 cents, people were more willing to buy, but they never asked for the change! My business boomed and by the time I retired from the lemonade industry I was $500 richer. As a young child, I did what I have done many times since: I embraced the solitude my introversion required to spark my creative juices, and in doing so, became an introverted leader. Five years later, I was an anxious twelve year-old on my first day of high school. I walked the crowded halls, heard the murmur around me, but felt alone. Initially, I sought solace in the orderliness of my schedule \\\\u2014 I purposely over-programmed myself \\\\u2013and was slightly embarrassed to spend a Friday night alone. Over time, I bottled up this nervousness, and poured myself into things I loved. I started \\'Crafts for Causes,\\' where each week I diligently prepped materials for a new project, which my club then created and sold for charity. I launched an Instagram account that promoted the school, then expanded this to become the leader of \\'Blue Crew,\\' our school\\'s spirit club. This past spring, as I stood in front of 400 classmates, poised to begin an upbeat \\'Blue Crew\\' speech, I thought back to my freshman year, when everyone at school considered me painfully shy. During my speech, I congratulated Crystal students\\' athletic and academic success, but in the back of my mind, I congratulated myself. Few classmates now see me as that shy, freshman girl, and I\\'m proud that I\\'m no longer limited by my introversion. This summer, my entrepreneurial career came full circle as I interned at four different internet startups. The beginning of each was like the first day of school all over again. My first steps were tentative. I designed surveys, gathered data from thousands of customers, then reflected on the results as I sketched out website designs to share with the team. By the end of week one, I was more confident, fueled by my ideas and my passion about the intersection of design and technology. Yes, I suffered through those four first days of awkward conversations and fear of forgetting names, but I moved beyond this. I learned to work with the other interns, to brainstorm, to build and fine-tune our presentations, but also to listen to my \\'inner self\\' as I confidently shared my ideas in ways that helped others understand their value. At the end of the summer, I was proud when a product executive watching my presentation said, \\'I wish I were half as poised as you when I was sixteen.\\' \\'Thanks,\\' I said, as I recognized the progress I\\'ve made since my lemonade stand in embracing my introversion to become a leader. \"}, {\"index\": 708, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Science, Philosophy and Policy. If anyone were to look over my activities and interests and the things I\\'ve worked on, they\\'d likely characterize my life so far as one thing: unfocused. And it probably is, objectively speaking, in terms of practicality, or pursuing a specific, well defined career track, or having a biography-ready story, nicely packaged and blatantly coherent. Psychologists might call it some form of attention deficit disorder, my counselor, academic distraction, and my parents, a wandering mind.The fact was, with all of my diverse endeavors and zeal to try more, my sleeping hours were continuously shrinking - yet I was unfazed and happily bounding forward. This I find rather hard to explain logically; but in the end, interests overcame fatigue and daunting tasks. While I understood that focusing in one field of study has benefits, I was not swayed completely, simply because I was dazzled by the knowledge revealed by different subjects and hooked by the excitement derived from reading numerous science journals, public policy studies, and philosophy essays. I enjoyed subjects ranging from modeling viscoelastic responses of the Earth\\'s crust to water to ice and land mass load changes, to east-coast sea level change in past six decades, to the establishment of senescence, rather than rationality, as the true basis of worth. And above all, I loved what I learned - proving hypotheses using data diagrams and regression analysis generated with MATLAB was just as rewarding as attempting a forceful rebuttal to a full-out cross examination in a debate. Classroom materials were all very well and good, but there wasn\\'t any need to limit myself just to those things. Why miss out on other rather extraordinary subjects?So when I studied the topic of end of life care on a school project, I first looked towards the obvious perspective: that of medical science. I carefully studied journals and pored over the numbers and data model - on trials conducted over years, in a group controlled for disease progression and risk factors. Some articles even went to quantify of the quality of life and happiness in order to establish \\'scientific\\' measurements of the effectiveness of treatments. But I came to realize rather quickly that these numbers and facts didn\\'t constitute the full picture. Considerations of where life derives its importance from, the will and desires of the patient and family, and the larger societal context of doctor\\'s role and ethical responsibilities were needed. I found that real world issues were complex and limiting them to a single field of study was ineffective.Truth is, I\\'m rather happy with where my interests have led me. Being constrained to one worldview, or just one experience, limits what I can do. After all, I couldn\\'t imagine how Benjamin Franklin, or Da Vinci, or Elon Musk would respond to wisdom advising them to \\'get focused\\'- though it would probably be some form of a noise of well qualified derision. But jokes aside, the world has lots of problems waiting to be solved, improvements to be made, and dreams to be achieved, with seven billion people, many of whom live in developing countries. To make our lives better, both today and tomorrow, is a project of science, a question for philosophy, and a challenge in policy. And I intend to give my best try at it. \"}, {\"index\": 709, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The phrase \\'the greatest nuclear disaster in history\\' reverberated in my head, but the only thing that stood out to me when I arrived was the silence. The entire town of Pripyat, the former site of the Chernobyl nuclear reactors, was deserted, with trees growing straight through the abandoned houses, the inhabitants of which had fled over twenty years ago. The impact of such a disaster, visible in the various forms of cancer it caused in surrounding areas, as well as the thousands of people who had to flee their countries, was seen here only in the desolate, overgrown streets... I saw our past in a young girl I met named Katya, whose family had to move to the corner of Belarus most distant from the border with Ukraine. At age 10, she bore large abdominal scars from multiple surgeries to remove her gastric cancer. When I told her that I lived in the United States, her parents insisted that her cancer would have been cured with the medical technology we have so readily available. Their idealistic but inaccurate assertions helped me see the flaws in medical care and research in the United States, as well as the prevalence of corruption and lack of modern medical technology and treatments in less developed countries. There was no cure at all, not even in a country like America, but I couldn\\'t bring myself to tell them about the flaws of medicine in the \\'land of opportunity.\\'... \"}, {\"index\": 710, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  As I stopped helping my uncle in the fields, I was left with more free time to spend. Therefore I joined a local volunteer group, The Helping Hawks, I didn\\'t know what to expect, but I was ready for it. As I was preparing food for the homeless, my mother walked in the kitchen asking me who I was cooking for. Coming from a household where meat was a rarity that we only ate it on special occasions. My mother was surprised. She then told me \\'this is the food we eat  for dinner, what are you doing?\\' I nervously stood there and I explained that it was for a good cause. My parents barely made enough money to feed us, there was no way I could \\'selflessly\\' throw away food, by feeding strangers. Nevertheless, if I did not continue cooking I would also be depriving homeless men from a warm meal. Hence, I decided to go along with the plan and go to the homeless shelter, but I also spent my monthly savings from my allowance to purchase the much needed gallon of milk and dozen of eggs that contributed to the desolation of my family\\'s refrigerator. My mother was skeptical about the whole thing as it wasn\\'t part of our Hispanic culture, especially when we were struggling economically, but she agreed, as she knew i worked hard to contribute to our family. I cautiously walked into the homeless shelter expecting to meet with my friends, hand in the food, and walk out.  However once I walked in with my homemade rice, all I saw were rows of empty tables. Then I realized I would be actually serving their plates, putting the food on their plates. I wanted to leave say I was ill or make up an excuse. However, everything changed as the men starting walking in with their torn sweaters, and tattered up shoes. I finally realized they really didn\\'t have anything. I decided to stay. With a ladle in hand I put a spoonful of rice on their plates and they smiled at me in complete gratitude. I felt something inside me, I was faced with a whole new experience. The men thanked me, but I didn\\'t realize how much I was truly affecting their lives. After they ate, a man came up to me and gave me hug. Under normal circumstances I would run from a stranger hugging me, but his hug was truly heartfelt and sincere. That moment was when I realized I was needed in my community.  I never knew I could feel so great helping and being involved in my community; I was raised believing the only people who needed me was my family. I was wrong.   \"}, {\"index\": 711, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Common App Essay:\\'This is a red line train to Portland City Center and Beaverton Transit Center.\\' A monotone voice pours out of hidden loudspeakers and cycles through four public transit lines. For most, the speakers are simply a guide to a future destination. For the chess players of Portland\\'s Pioneer Square, the sound is a heartbeat. At first the audio is background noise, but over time it becomes something different. For almost all who have been a part of Portland\\'s tight knit chess community, the feminine voice evokes a certain nostalgia for blissful afternoons with the retired, quirky, homeless, and passionately addicted.I joined the Pioneer Square chess community on a sweltering June day in the summer before I entered high school. I played quite a lot of chess when I was younger, but I had lost interest in the formality and uptightness of tournaments. I wanted to play to have fun and meet new people, and I had heard that Pioneer Square was the perfect place to do just that. I stepped off the light rail and was immediately greeted by two players playing blitz chess. When the light rail\\'s audio started playing, I saw one player mouth along with the recording as he slipped a bishop across the board. I smiled, and decided to stand in line for the next game. That summer I spent a majority of my time at the Square. I bought chess books and studied so that I could execute opening strategies like the Nimzo-Indian and Scandinavian defenses. I learned that Portland\\'s chess community wasn\\'t concentrated solely in the Square, but also in coffee shops and bookstores. I even saved up babysitting money for a nice chess clock which I constantly kept on loan to other players.I played chess in Portland for all but one of my high school summers. The summer before Junior year, I participated in an eight week residential summer college program. I was initially excited to join the chess life on campus, but during the first few days I learned that the school\\'s chess club was on hiatus for the summer. I was disappointed, because I was looking forward to meeting a new group of chess players. I realized that I wasn\\'t going to be able to join a chess community, but there was nothing stopping me from finding people to play with.About a week into the program I decided to purchase a dry-erase board from the campus bookstore, and on it I wrote \\'If you want to play a game of chess, just come up and ask!\\' After my classes I set the board up across from a fountain and propped the sign up on my backpack. The first person to approach me was a graduate student from NYU, and we played and chatted for the better part of an hour. Over the next seven weeks I met shogi players, faculty, students, tourists, locals, and dozens more. I even got crushed by a man who turned out to be a former senior world champion! The important part about this experience for me was that a chess community had grown around me. In a place without a community, I created my own.I recently came across a picture from the online series \\'Humans of New York\\' with a caption that reads \\'Chess, like soccer, is a common thread between so many cultures.\\' It has dawned on me that it isn\\'t Pioneer Square that made me love the Portland chess community, but rather the people I have met there. We chess players are a sampling of humanity. We come from all walks of life, and chess is the glue that holds us together. Chess is beautiful because it can be played anywhere by anyone, and therefore the place I feel most content isn\\'t tied to any real location: all I need is a chess board. \"}, {\"index\": 712, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]        I was only four when I learned the importance of Nelson Mandela\\'s quote, \\'If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.\\' I grew up under the watchful gaze of my Russian grandparents. It was during this formative period that I developed the values I hold to this day, among which is the importance of multiculturalism and multilingualism.  Up until my first day of school I neither heard nor spoke a word of English. I was not oblivious of the language\\'s existence, but I was never allowed to investigate it. This parenting decision was justified by my grandmother\\'s fear of the onset of \\'Rusglish\\' \\\\u2013 a dreadful blend of improper cases and declensions, as well as English words shoved into Russian sentences at random. With her old-fashioned manipulation, she instilled in me a very genuine fear of all things English.  Due to a clerical error, I was placed into a regular, non-ESL kindergarten class. Those first few miserable weeks are still vivid in my memory, although I never participated in anything. I was determined to put an end to the perpetual loneliness, and helplessness that I was feeling, so I came up with a plan to teach myself English. While my grandmother was doing several households\\' worth of chores, I was watching the BBC \\\\u2013 the only English channel available with her $11.99 a month cable package \\\\u2013 with closed captions, staring at the words as they crawled along the screen and matching them to the audio. I admit that this was not the most efficient method for learning a language, but it got me to the point where I could read. This initiated a whole new phase of my life: while my classmates were finger-painting or presenting their rock collections during show-and-tell, I was sitting in a corner devouring every book within reach.  I was well aware that I was being laughed at and ostracized by my peers; however, I remained focused on that one day in the future when I would miraculously be able to speak to them. I began staying up late simulating conversations in my head and constructing appropriate responses to hypothetical questions (imagining a social life proved to be a much appreciated skill later on). Eventually, my class began our very first chapter book \\\\u2013 something about a mouse named Geronimo Stilton. The prospect of uninterrupted text without pictures was quite daunting; when the teacher asked for volunteers to read, no one was willing. Except me. It was a colossal surprise to my teacher, who proceeded to stare at my raised hand for quite some time. She finally nodded, and I began to read in my authentic, BBC-trained, cut-glass English accent.  Although my faux-British rendition of Geronimo\\'s big adventure did not yield the social awakening I had imagined, I was incredibly proud to have gained entry into this foreign world. I was overwhelmed by the second set of literature, film, art, music, and history to which I had just gained access. That excitement lasted several years, but it was eventually replaced by an interest in learning French, then Italian, and recently, Spanish.  The importance of speaking many languages was clear to me at a very young age; today, my goal is to speak to as many people as possible in their native languages in order to truly reach their hearts, as Mr. Mandela suggests. I am incredibly grateful to my family for giving me the invaluable albeit accidental opportunity to coexist in two cultures at once. Many first-generation Americans see their heritage as an obstacle that towers between them and the life they want to live. To me, my heritage is not a nuisance that hinders everything I do, it is a tremendous force, without which I would never do what I do or be who I am. \"}, {\"index\": 713, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Sophia.

Now, I tilt my head down to hide the fire scorching my face as the teacher moves down the aisle.  She pauses before my desk. I pick at a fray on my shirt. Spectacles lowered, then back on her nose. Licks her fingers and graciously turns the page, squinting for a mistake. Seeing none, she places her clipboard on my desk, points to my name on the page, squelched between rows of Emilys and Marias and Johns.  \\'Is this you?\\' I nod.

By eleventh grade, I was an expert at noticing that strained pause right before my name as the poor substitute struggled to piece together the letters which should not go together. I was such an expert, in fact, that I often raised my hand and said a cheerful \\'present!\\' before they even began. Relieved, most moved on with a thankful smile at this girl who understood them so well. But one day the premature \\'present!\\' caught in my throat as the substitute teacher held up his hand, palm facing me\\\\u2014stop. His eyes narrowed in concentration. He turned to me, looked me straight in the eye, and began \\'Len-fa\\\\u2026Linfang?\\' He said it smoothly, matter-of-factly, as if there could be no other way to say it, only right. The flames rising up my chest were downed by a flood of gratefulness and surprise.  \\'Yes.\\' I answered, stunned. \\'That\\'s perfect, perfect.\\'  \\'I teach ESOL students,\\' he answered. \\'I think that if we expect them to learn English, then we should at least be able to say their names correctly. Their names are a reflection of their culture.\\'  Never had three sentences been so eloquent, so true. What my parents spent years trying to tell me I now began to grasp.  I live on a strange middle ground as the only daughter of first generation immigrants, between two cultures spanning the world apart. It is difficult\\\\u2014no, impossible\\\\u2014to flawlessly wade between the two vastly different oceans, without getting swept up by a tidal wave to one side or the other. My name is the bridge. My name keeps me anchored, so I do not drift aimlessly away, forgetting one culture in favor of the other. Recently, my parents offered me an olive branch: I could choose a middle name to fill that empty space on my birth certificate, any middle name I liked. For a while I scoured the library for Baby Names books, or pestered my friends with \\'do I look like a Sophia or a Camille?\\' But as of now, that place between my first and last names remains empty, filled with potential. It has the potential to be anything, anyone I want\\\\u2014\\'wisdom\\' or \\'most beautiful\\' or \\'of noble birth.\\' But for now, just Linfang is enough.  \"}, {\"index\": 714, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea\\'To draw a flower, as is taught conventionally, one must first outline the shape. Then, color is added to the developing sketch. Dimension is created by shading and highlighting, finally giving the creation form. This process will allow one to craft a completely lifelike, entirely lifeless flower.I can still vividly recall watching a series of video interviews of Georgia O\\'Keeffe in my beginning art class. She spoke of how she had shapes in her mind, these inner feelings that were so natural and powerful that they took on a parallel visual form. They were fleeting, yet entirely personal glimpses into the inner workings of her mind. Through art, she could see them with clarity.In the beginning of my artistic career, I struggled to understand what O\\'Keeffe meant. The art that surrounded me was championed for its realism and detail, not its message or expressiveness. Art, as it seemed at the time, was merely a thoughtless competition to mirror reality. I cringe to admit it now, but Picasso\\'s famous cubism or Matisse\\'s vibrant paper cuts simply didn\\'t make sense to me in the terms of my realism-programmed mind. O\\'Keeffe spoke of a similar struggle in her interview, remembering her college years where she dreaded recreating yet another stale, realistic still life of fruit or a vase of flowers, which would ironically become her most recognizable subjects. She eventually decided to reject conventional teachings and paint using the impressions that swirled around in her head to enhance reality. Her method seemed to contradict everything I had learned; she saw as much with her mind as she did with her eyes.Inspired, I attempted a similar process. Instead of just painting a reference from a picture, I began my artistic procedure with reflection. Thinking with no bounds was liberating. I entered every one of my consequent pieces with a clear intention. Every stroke and line was fueled with a sense of purpose; instead of working towards reality, I strove to materialize an abstract concept. The art that I made continued to grow, as I delved deeply into my thoughts and gained more knowledge. Soon, my subjects were concerned with the psychological exploration of the personality, or the historic states of human condition, topics that I would have once never imagined could reach into the realm of art. Although it seems quite obvious in retrospect, gaining the ability to incorporate ideas and emotions into my art was one of my most meaningful accomplishments. It became the step that advanced my hobby into a legitimate passion, one that I could explore with the quality and depth of any academic pursuit I had ever undertaken. Now, I could connect my passion for learning and ideas with the expression and beauty of art. By using insight as augmentation to my senses, the world bloomed before me with the intense vitality and color of an O\\'Keeffe flower. O\\'Keefe\\'s words inspired me to develop my own artistic voice, one that now proudly demonstrates my beliefs and ideas. Some suggest that literature says a few things with a lot, but art speaks volumes with very little. While one of my previous pieces could only reflect the obviousness of reality, today, it can speak eloquently on the nature of who I am.That, is how I learned to draw a flower. \"}, {\"index\": 715, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I could never survive in the vacuum of space, because music would never be able to reach my ears. I have never been very partial to any music genre, and there are those who often say \\'I\\'ll listen to any type of music,\\' but for me that statement is a personal aphorism rather than a declaration of indifference towards music. I became a music-lover in imitation of my uncle, who prided himself in his multi-thousand- album music library; I became a music player in imitation of all the virtuosos that flaunted their brilliance in the albums of my music collection. I started compiling my library by simply amassing music on my iPod, which was effortless, because of how ubiquitous music is.   However, listening to thousands of songs takes time, and truly loving them takes years. In addition to discovering music, I also focus on making my own, although I am by no means a musician. Despite an admitted mediocrity at creating music, I can\\'t get enough of it. Whether I am articulating a bass part on my tuba, attempting to play a riff on the piano, or strumming away on my treasured Martin, I am always elated to try my hand at the music I cherish so much. Of all the instruments I \\'play,\\' my love lies with the guitar. The guitar is such a universal instrument, because any song can easily be transposed and played with great tonality. I listen to a towering number of songs, and singing or playing allows me to draw even more out of the music than before, which is like nothing else I have ever experienced.As much as I like to pretend, I can\\'t play guitar like Jimmy Page, I can\\'t write songs like Bob Dylan, and I can\\'t croon handsomely like Willie Nelson. However, I can do something that none of them can do in recorded music; I can immerse myself in everything they play, write, and sing, and enjoy it through my senses, make it my own, and turn it into something more than a three minute song. Ultimately, I am able to interpret each song according to my own feelings, which is something truly unique to everyone.  \"}, {\"index\": 716, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 717, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The girl who cannot see asks me how I see myself. \\'I am a dancer,\\' I say. I ask her how she sees herself. \\'An artist,\\' she says. So, we decide together that she will blend her art with what I can teach her about movement to music.Dance is my sport, my challenge, and my pursuit. Tights and leotards have been a staple of my wardrobe since I first donned a pink tutu. I have spent years gripping a ballet barre with an amalgamation of sweat and hairspray beading at the back of my neck and my feet shoved into dainty pink satin torture chambers.Dance is a visual art, but the joy I get from dancing is not from achieving a certain aesthetic or receiving adulation from the audience. To me, dance is a feeling.My favorite dance classes of the week are the ones I help teach to the visually impaired. In one class, there is a six-year-old girl who knows more about fashion than I ever will. She is fully blind, but when she holds my hand she informs me that I desperately need a manicure and pink sparkly nail polish.In another class, I work individually with a sixteen-year-old named Melissa. Dance class gives all the students a rare opportunity to claim control over their bodies and the freedom to run, jump, and twirl. For Melissa, the class is an hour of sheer expression.Melissa and I choreographed her solo piece for the final performance. She was asked to write an \\'I Am\\' poem that would become the basis of her dance. Pen in hand, I asked her what word she would use to describe herself. She could not settle on one word, so she turned the question back on me. \\'What would you say?\\' she asked.\\'I am a dancer,\\' I responded instinctively. Suddenly I knew how I could help her. \\'What do you love to do?\\' I asked.I struggled to keep my pen moving at the pace that she rattled off her favorite activities. Painting with acrylics, oils, and watercolors. Filling her sketchbook with charcoal drawings. Watching movies - her favorite being Disney\\'s Frozen. Dancing.The first two lines of her poem read:I am MelissaI am a painterI am the bridge between visual art and the visually impairedAnd from those lines, we were able to envision the entire concept of her solo piece, choreographed to Frozen\\'s anthem, \\'Let it go\\'.A large canvas is wheeled onto the center of the stage and a dancer follows. Her arms move with the music, painting invisible lines before the audience. She swivels upstage and grabs the paintbrush in one sweeping movement. She creates a brushstroke in time with each musical accent, filling the melody and canvas with long streaks of blue paint. Setting the brush aside, the dancer steps towards the audience and creates an expansive circular movement with her body to illustrate the building rhythm. The audience is mesmerized. On the last note the dancer triumphantly stretches her arms above her. As she stands there, smiling, the music stops and the audience erupts. She cannot see, but this is her art.After the adulation subsides, an exuberant smile remains on the dancer\\'s face. She says to me that she is still a painter but today she feels like a dancer. I know that feeling. I am smiling too, and my eyes begin to water. I see something of myself in the girl who cannot see. \"}, {\"index\": 718, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 719, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] With the ultimate goal of studying medicine, I have a passion for the biological and health sciences; however, I recognize that the field of medicine is not isolated to the science of treatment. My love of travel and learning about different cultures inspired my interest in studying Anthropology, and in the future, I hope to use my background in this field to understand how different cultures view and treat medicine, as well as to see how people in all corners of the earth approach their overall health. I am also extremely interested in Women and Gender studies. As a young, Hispanic female, social awareness and gender equality are both very important to me, and will continue to grow in importance as I strive to make a difference worldwide.  \"}, {\"index\": 720, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I waited politely for my roommate to close the door behind her, and immediately broke down crying. I was in Beijing, China, on a National Security Language Initiative for Youth (NSLI-Y) exchange program; I\\'d never been so far from everything I knew. After a lonely night in Beijing, I was taken to Chengdu, a city of 8 million people that dwarfed everything I\\'d seen before. My first week there was miserable. Each morning, I woke up to check my phone calendar reassuring myself that I\\'d be home soon, and I fell asleep wishing I\\'d never left Missouri. I walked to school daily to learn Mandarin, and although there were fourteen other Americans my age, I felt isolated.My host family was incredibly sweet and friendly: my host grandmother could say \\'apple\\' and \\'sofa,\\' my host grandfather cooked and smiled at me benignly, my host parents spoke little English, and my host sister was stressed, spending her free time studying. Although I found them agreeable, it was tough to get to know them because of the language barrier.Chengdu, despite its size and fame in China, isn\\'t much of a tourist city; it sees few foreigners. On one of its hot days, one deluged by torrential rain, I left the apartment and went to the bargain mall next door. I explored the noisy alleys, passing vendors who were polite enough to thinly conceal their confusion at my hair color and eye shape (what\\\\u2014a foreigner in Chengdu?!):  instead of goggling faces, they plastered on store clerk smiles. While looking for the exit to the maze of shops, something happened to change the rest of the time I spent in China, and to change me.I saw the exit, but more importantly, my ears picked out the notes of a melody floating through the halls behind me, discerning them from the storm of haggling. It was\\\\u2014a mote of something familiar\\\\u2014a song, \\'Scarborough Fair\\' by Simon and Garfunkel. I\\'ve listened to it to hundreds of times. When I recognized it, I immediately turned from the exit and searched instead for its source. I found it to be the laptop of a vendor, who seemed enchanted by the tune\\\\u2014who wouldn\\'t be?\\\\u2014amidst the tumult. A beckoning stool sat beside him; I sat. He looked at me, surprised, but with a genuine smile, and I didn\\'t hesitate to return it. We turned to his laptop, and I started singing along, joined by him and a small group of vendors that gathered around us. We all sang together, and they smiled encouragingly at me as our voices mingled, flooding the air and drowning out the surrounding cacophony with euphonic song.I don\\'t know exactly what it was\\\\u2014perhaps feeling connected with people who couldn\\'t have understood me otherwise\\\\u2014but after that almost surreal moment, I felt completely at home in Chengdu. The unfamiliar waters were bridged: China clicked with me subconsciously, and I regained my confidence. As a result, I studied harder in my Mandarin class, allowing me to finally talk to my Chinese family. Friends and memories were made, and I even managed to make my overly serious sister laugh while doing homework together. The day I left China was almost unbearably distressing for my family and me. My dad, struggling to hold back tears, made me promise to return someday; I believe that I will. To this day, my sister and I have kept in touch via email, trading stories and encouragement.After my experience in China, I came home a different person. I\\'ve taken my life into my own hands, and in doing so, I have won my parents\\' hard-earned respect and their trust to make my own decisions. That single moment changed me from an angsty kid to a responsible almost-adult, and because of it, I know I will meet new experiences head-on and with enthusiasm.  \"}, {\"index\": 721, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] We walked into Junior Leadership on the first day with low expectations. It was gym, we thought. Mr. W, the teacher, handed us two wristbands, one that said \\'Self\\' and another that said \\'Others.\\' He told us that if we completed the class and mastered professionalism, we would earn a third - \\'Community.\\' \\'Complete the class and master professionalism\\' - never before have six words correlated with so much running, so much sweat, so many push ups. Daily, we sprinted half a mile to class from the locker rooms. We stood in a six by six formation, shouting a call-and-response. We drilled in perfect rows, saluted the teacher upon arrival, and ran laps without cutting the corners, or we started over. Mr. W wanted Evidence - sweat. I remember once turning my head, mid-push up, and seeing a rippling square of orange shirts and blue shorts, arms wobbling, faces dripping with Evidence. I thought the whole routine was an unnecessary charade for most of the year - until the final. The assignment was to write a speech about our purpose in life. Most people wrote something very predictable, achieving world peace or personal happiness; clearly, we expected a wildly different experience from what was soon to happen.In a dusty lecture hall brimming with the anticipation of summer, Mr. W choked back tears and admitted, \\'My nephew died that day. He was four, and I was a junior. He always wanted to play outside, and I always said \\'tomorrow\\'.\\' And one by one, the walls that had divided us crumbled as kids of all academic levels and racial backgrounds abandoned their prepared speeches for similarly private experiences. The happy-go-lucky girl in class got up and revealed how she struggles with severe depression; the varsity baseball player sobbed as he admitted that he believes he has a second chance at life because he was almost killed by a car; the class clown thanked Mr. W for frequently calling him out, saying he\\'s a stronger personbecause of it. Suddenly, the class I had signed up for because my friends told me it was lax had become an invaluable one,one that taught me something fundamental about life and about myself. As I glanced around the room, I saw my classmates looking back around, at me and at everyone else, awe-struck. Until those speeches, we had not realized - not even for a second - that all of that Evidence leveled us into a community so that then we could find what was common among us. Just as it clicked, Mr. W tossed me my \\'Community\\' wristband.Before Junior Leadership, I sought to differentiate myself from my classmates. When there are thousands of applicants to great schools, admission demands uniqueness. In pursuit of success, I geared my high school career toward distinction from my peers. But post-Mr. W, I am convinced that the richness of knowledge stems from what is shared. Before the final, I was unsure whether I would accept an offer for an internship in environmental engineering, exploring the unknown toxicities of widely manufactured nanoparticles. When I walked out of that lecture hall, I sent an email securing the internship but asking for a partner to work with, too - someone who would push me, just like my fellow cadets had in Mr. W class. On the one hand, the two of us used advanced chemistry to predict and explain toxic interactions. And on the other, we worked to protect the environment and our health, necessities we all share. Before I decided to accept this internship, it was so much easier to trust that our climate would be fixed by someone smarter, someone more determined, someone with better education. But as carbon dioxide levels reach critical concentrations and weather patterns shift ominously, big work needs to start, and that \\'Community\\' wristband on my desk kept nagging me to get going, already. So I did. \"}, {\"index\": 722, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The All-State Orchestra was the chance to prove that I was one of the top high school cellists in the state. My first year, I was rather immature about practicing and thus failed to make the orchestra. Next year, however, as soon as the excerpts came out, I immediately started practicing and adhered to the rigid practice schedule I had created for myself. I vowed not to let a lack of discipline again be the cause for me not making All-State. When the audition finally came around, I felt ready. I didn\\'t feel too nervous, and walked in confidently when it was my time to go in. Once I sat down, however, all the pressures I had put on myself while practicing for this one audition suddenly attacked me. I was overwhelmed by thoughts such as, \\'If you fail, all that time you spent practicing will mean nothing!\\' I started to play, but my limbs felt out of my control. A pervasive feeling of panic took hold of me throughout the audition and all of my notes sounded shaky and timid. I left the audition knowing that, once again, I had not made the orchestra. My four months of hard work amounted to nothing simply because I couldn\\'t control nervousness. After I was informed that I hadn\\'t made All-State, I felt real depression. For a while, all I could do was mope around while the thought, \\'I worked hard and still failed\\' plagued me. I remember couching myself in front of the tv while watching comedy and after comedy in an attempt to break out of this bleak, sad bubble. My failure forced me to question why I even played the cello. Doubt began to gnaw at me. How could I ever make it in the music world if nervousness was going to spring on me every time I had to play for another person? After much thought, I realized that what hurt the most about my failure stemmed from my fear that the people whose opinions I valued the most would not see me as a good player unless I made All-State. I started to wonder if I only played cello as a way to gain confidence from others. Then a memory from a concert one month before came back to me. For one precious moment during that concert, the beauty of the music had fully possessed me and I had felt connected to the rest of the orchestra emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually. This memory brought to me the understanding that music is meant to create beauty and that trying to use it as a way to attain self-esteem through others is bound to fail. This year, I practiced diligently but also with a feeling of peace that I lacked previous years. Because of my new outlook on music, I knew that my merit as a cellist was not solely dependent on making it into the All-State Orchestra. Instead of robotically trying to perfect every note, I tried to enjoy practicing and really feel the music. Then I found myself in a concerto competition where, just like the All-State audition, I had to play live for judges. The nervousness returned. I was very intimidated by the judges who were sitting six feet in front of me and was sweating and trembling uncontrollably before I had even started to play. Once the music started, however, my nervousness turned into something else. I felt the judges responding well to my playing and, for the first time, actually enjoyed myself during a performance that was being judged. I discovered that nervousness did not have to be a demon that held me back but in fact could be channeled into a very exciting energy.  \"}, {\"index\": 723, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] My identity resembles the complex nature of proteins (and not just because I\\'m composed of them). Amino acids form unique sequences up to thirty thousand units long through a myriad of finely-tuned biological processes. It seems so improbable that the amino acid side chains should bond to each other in the exact conformation required to produce a three-dimensional, functional protein. Their final form relies on an incalculable number of subunits and external mechanisms. In the same way, I see myself as the sum of many experiences, especially those involving my family. We never conformed to the stereotypical suburban family mold that constantly surrounded us, but I couldn\\'t be more thankful. After all, who would dare confine the vast array of proteins to a single template?One could say that I had an unconventional childhood. My parents were young when I was born (eighteen and twenty-four), and it shows. As a child, I used to spend rainy afternoons coloring in the star outlines tattooed on my dad\\'s elbows or stringing necklaces through my mom\\'s gauged earring holes. Because of my parents\\' influence, I developed a habit of blasting Green Day songs that make the ceiling shake, a deep love for the original Star Wars trilogy, and an appreciation for colorful liberty spikes.Though their ages and quirks make my friends refer to them as the \\'cool parents,\\' my mom and dad practically grew up alongside me. I watched them deal with their own issues--miscommunication, infidelity, and depression, amongst others. I was the one to watch over my younger brother while my dad worked and my mom slept on the couch, too depressed to cope with being awake. I learned to be mature and responsible when they could not. While I love my family dearly, their mistakes always stuck in the back of my mind. I applied myself in school, determined to avoid being labeled as the daughter of a teen mom and a college dropout. In elementary school, I was the kid making my own supplemental spelling lists and begging to work in the library during recess.Eventually, my determination transformed--I was no longer working to defy the paths of my parents, but to pursue my own interests. I joined Science Olympiad on a whim and discovered a passion for biochemistry and proteomics, guiding me to lead academic teams and get involved with research. I now embrace my unorthodox childhood. Though it doesn\\'t define me, I am the daughter of a teen mom and college dropout. From a young age, they showed me how difficult it is to find decent work without a college degree and how depressing it is to go through the motions of a passionless job. Because of my family, I refuse to settle for anything less than reaching my full potential.As much as I\\'ve gleaned from the mistakes of my parents, happy memories stand out the most. I love looking back on the fall afternoons the \\'blanket monster\\' chased me around the house and the July evenings I listened to my mom belt out \\'Steamroller Blues\\' on the porch. No, we never lived in a subdivision and my mother never joined the PTA, but my parents\\' influence shaped me into a strong-willed and passionate individual. From blissful moments to life lessons, my childhood experiences and influences are like the amino acids that make up a protein. They\\'re my primary structure--what make me me. \"}, {\"index\": 724, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Thoughts buzz around my head constantly imploring me to ask \\'who am I\\'. Who am I to be denied the ability to speak my thoughts instead of having them congest into madness? I am the stutterer, the mumbler, the fidgeter who dare not look up.  Yet I am also the embodiment of defiance itself and also nothing at all. My identity is provisional since contentment is nothing if not the dynamism to improve one\\'s lot in life. I sought out contentment where I could be free to improve. Debate in particular breathed the familiar scent of home upon me.Debate drew me in because I had no faith in myself, and it led me to discover, through coaching and introspection, that I could learn to appreciate my capacity to persuade. I have become a debater; I strongly believe in the power of debate as a place of safe communication crafted from the narratives we carry within. I create spaces where I, and every debater I coach, can feel free to communicate without fear of being seen as inadequate. I entered the debate community as a freshman afraid of what to expect. My coach opened the first meeting with cautionary words about how much of a time commitment debate would be and then gave the floor to our officers. I gazed at all the trophies she had sculpted out of previous freshmen. I wanted to be a trophy, to be burdened with the reverence due onto those who can usher our passions out, who know how to do things with a sharp mind and a sharper tongue. I wanted to become a top speaker. \\'Debate is bringing the argument to the man on the street,\\' my coach would say. Because of her indelible stain as one of the greats upon my mind, her advocacy compelled immediate assent through its veneer of facticity. I worked hard to step outside of myself into my critics\\' minds. By the end of freshman year, I had slowed down, ironed out the tics in my diction, calmed my hands down, and fixed my posture to deliver the best argument--and me-- possible. Improvement for performance\\'s sake--it seemed to be working.I went to debate camp the summer of my sophomore year. Camp bled out my wide-eyed belief in myself as just another trophy mold and in its place left true confidence. Over two weeks, debates at camp taught me to question the underlying assumptions of debate and to make arguments from within myself instead of off a fictive man-off-the-street\\'s beliefs. What could debate be? It\\'s debatable.Everything is an argument. I finally understood that everything is arguable, discussable, changeable.  Debate no longer manifested to me as a homogenous, charismatic, blue-blazered blob of some-day politicians or the next big courtroom breakouts. My capacity to infuse debate with meaning changed my outlook. I no longer wanted to be enshrined on a pedestal, covered in a film of eloquence, oozing charisma just because I could. I wanted to recreate debate as a quilt woven out of argumentative diversity.Since then, I have become the president of our team. I silently take in every mis-speak and nervous assertion from my novice debaters. I listen critically and sift through rhetorical noise in search of their ideas. Not once have I told them to speak as well as the golden boys that ran through my mind. I use my role as a critic to empower them to believe enough in their advocacies to not want to one day become mere trophies.\\'Debate is bringing the argument to the man on the street.\\' I don\\'t think my coach expected a reply, but I have spent the last two years penning one through action. Debate is bringing the argument out from within oneself. Debate is pulling my confidence up by the weight of mere words only to help others do the same.  \"}, {\"index\": 725, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I find my solace in Strawberry Fields, in a 17th century Spanish town, and standing among \\'strange fruit\\' in the South. Since I was a little girl I have found my solace in music. In this environment I can find happiness, security, and peace. Through the beautiful harmonies of the Beatles, the astounding bravado of Mozart\\'s Don Giovanni, and Billie Holliday\\'s melancholy commentary on the horrors of lynching, I am transported to worlds in which all may not be well, but I am content. Since birth I have been singing; my father often tells me that my life is a musical because I even sing my homework. My first piano piece didn\\'t come from a level one practice book, but from the Disney song books that lay on the piano at my grandmother\\'s house. Over several Sunday dinners I learned to play the theme song from Beauty and the Beast and delighted in showing off for my grandma as I butchered the rhythm and she feigned admiration. I didn\\'t cry as I watched her die, when I heard she was dead, or even at the funeral. But in the car on the way home, I began to sob while singing \\'Beauty and the Beast.\\' As I sang the tears became more violent and I trembled, but after my five and a half minute rendition of the two minute and thirty-four second song, the unfortunate day and heart-lurching loss seemed unimportant because I could keep her alive in that song. By expressing myself in the melodic lines I have a sense that I am contributing positively to the world by creating art. The knowledge that my pain and raw emotion can create a dimension of beauty through my interpretations of famous pieces or in my own writing, both musical and prose, makes me feel content and even happy. Escaping into my music is not a correct phrasing of what I do because I do not escape but rather explore and revel in it. Delving into the motives for the emotion or lack thereof allows me to pinpoint the causes of my distress or joy so that I can prevent making the same mistakes in the future and promote the things that gives me joy. Music can even help me sleep. \\'Boston\\' by Augustana is not a high classical piece or a dramatic power ballad riddled with high notes and unusual instruments. However, when I can\\'t sleep I sneak down the stairs to the piano and play \\'Boston\\'. The simple chords in the left hand paired with the repetitive pattern in the right hand lulls me into a calm and content state. During a restive period, when I am sick, or even when I am resisting sleep because I fear a particular nightmare, I find my way to \\'Boston\\'. The idea in \\'Boston\\' isn\\'t that we will escape the life that we are living but that a new life is out there for us if we are willing to find it. The musical mirroring emphasizes the powerful idea of the song as the bridge tells the listener that the girl will no longer be a victim of circumstance. \\'Boston\\' is the American dream in a song. The idea makes me content because I believe in the idea that we can start over and create the lives that we have wanted if we are willing to take the risk and fight for the reward. As I repeat the song at one in the morning and then sit down to my laptop I know that I will sleep well tonight because I am content in the music and the dream that is played through my hands and on my lips.  \"}, {\"index\": 726, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'Is anybody not ready?\\' I ask loudly across the room. My audience looks up in anticipation, ink pens hovering over the legalsize paper, ears ready to listen to every complex argument that escapes my mouth. My heart is beating a thousand miles a minute and I take a deep breath, press the start button on my timer, and begin.Stop the speech timer. The debate room is a living, breathing entity. It transcends the laws of time and space. The debate room can be our family study in the basement. It can be a cramped storage closet at the national tournament in Birmingham, Alabama or it can be a spacious open library where my debate partner Nathan and I won the first Kansas tournament of the season. It can be a back practice room where I critique novice and stare in amazement as their arguments grow complex and in turn they grow as individuals. Most often however, the debate room is E301. That\\'s where my coach and I talk.Rewind about 3.5 years. I\\'m an East High Freshman and I\\'m sitting in E301 front and center wondering what this strange tall lady wants us to do with the notecards in front of us. She explains, \\'Both people should read their notecard to their table neighbor and then in 45 seconds explain why your argument is better than their argument.\\'I had no idea at the time, but the small text on the notecard had what I now know as evidence on it and the strange tall lady was our debate coach whom the squad affectionately refers to as Coachie. I couldn\\'t imagine that stepping inside the debate room would be the first step in the most transformative years of my life.Fast forward a little less than a year. It is the summer before my sophomore year. I\\'m in the debate room again, working with Chris Anton, a senior on the squad. I now realize that the debate begins months before I button my dress shirt, look up how to tie a necktie on Youtube, and climb in the van with the distinctive license plate \\'COACHIE\\' to travel to the tournament. Debate begins at the library. Debate begins examining a global map to find the small island nation of Cuba. Debate begins on the IPCC website pouring over the newest study on climate change. Debate begins with research and understanding, and such is life.I am not the only one whose eyes are focused on the debate room. About two months ago, if I had done a survey of the surveyors, political scientists who had a strong stake in correctly predicting this year\\'s election outcome correctly, Kansas would be too far right to even show up as a blip on the radar. On September 3rd, when Democratic candidate Chad Taylor withdrew from the Kansas senatorial race, everything changed. The contest between the incumbent senator Pat Roberts and his independent challenger Greg Orman suddenly drew national and international attention. It is potentially the most important senate race in the nation as well as a major shift for Kansas away from its strict conservative values. On October 15th a local news station hosted the final debate between the two candidates. A couple of weeks earlier my debate coach informed me that, because of my involvement in debate, I had earned a front row seat as an official timekeeper for the debate.As I begin my senior year of debate I realize how much it has affected me since that fateful day my freshman year. I\\'ll miss high school debate and as I leave to begin the next chapter of my life I have to ask myself a question: \\'Yash, are you ready?\\' Debate allows me to decisively answer \\'YES.\\' \"}, {\"index\": 727, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 728, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 729, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I am perfectly content sitting with Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the Gryffindor Common Room, preferably in the best seats around the fireplace.I know it\\'s impossible for me to be physically present in this fictional environment, but ever since I first started reading the series at age nine, the world of Harry Potter has been a very real place of comfort for me. As a shy, sensitive, and awkward kid, books helped me escape the confines of my inadequacies. I first picked up the Harry Potter series thinking it would just be like all the other books I\\'d read. But as I picked them up again and again (17 times, more specifically), they grew to be more than just stories. They became my guidebooks as I began to navigate through the confusing, messy, yet joyful process of growing up.   As a kid, I tended to bottle up my anxiety and frustration until they brewed into indignant anger. I could never understand the reasons behind my emotions, let alone put them into words, and tears became my only way of expressing my feelings. But getting to know the inner workings of Harry\\'s mind helped me to feel less alone in this respect. The books don\\'t just say, \\'Harry was angry\\'; they say, \\'Harry\\'s blood boiled with anger as his face went hot,\\' a vivid reaction that felt completely familiar to me. The fact that the brave, heroic, albeit fictional Harry Potter suffered from some of the same flaws and emotions that I did really helped get me out of my own head. I started to entertain the possibility that others around me (in the Muggle world) shared my emotions and were more similar to than different from me. Hermione Granger was a reflection of my preteen self who eventually grew to be my biggest role model. Like her, I poured myself into being the best in school in order to hide my insecurities and tried not to care about fitting in. Luckily, as Hermione had Harry and Ron, I had a handful of great friends that were able to see past my quirks. Hermione learned, like I did, to find true acceptance and value in friendship rather than in grades and achievements, while at the same time never apologizing for her intensity. Using her cleverness and resourcefulness, Hermione always does everything she possibly can to help others. To me, her kindness and unwavering devotion to justice are her most notable qualities, not her intelligence or her abilities. Hermione always demonstrates that doing the right thing is more important than just getting the right answer.I had less time to revisit Harry Potter upon entering high school, and when I read, I looked for other options that I felt were more sophisticated. But when I decided to reread The Prisoner of Azkaban in junior year, I realized that Harry Potter will always play an important role in my life, no matter how old I am. As a child, the Harry Potter books gave me a place of refuge and escape. But as a teenager, I could see ways in which my life, my feelings, and my experiences resembled those described in the books. Harry Potter makes me think about what my own personal quest in life is and inspired me to find something I\\'m passionate about, like Harry and his friends feel about becoming wizards one day. Through college and beyond, I aspire to absorb myself in the world that exists around me, with the hope to one day become a greater part of it.I\\'m deeply grateful to J.K. Rowling for the Harry Potter series, which has helped me figure out who I am and who I want to be. I\\'ve read many wonderful books and had even more wonderful opportunities throughout my life, but no matter where I\\'ve been or where I\\'ll go, Hogwarts will always feel like home.  \"}, {\"index\": 730, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Allow me to paint you a picture.The first brushstrokes are red, green and blue, as I paint for you the walls I was born into; colorful, bright, but walls nonetheless. As a child, I was grateful for their presence, for the fa\\\\u00e7ade of support they offered. But as I grew, the walls remained still, restricting me. Their colors eventually dimmed as I matured, merging into an oppressive, claustrophobic brown.You are to be a good, quiet Muslim girl.You are to marry your cousin when your age permits it.You are to become a compliant wife and a caring mother.Your education is an accessory.Walls don\\'t speak, but society does. Surrounded by walking standard enforcers, I knew little else.Desperate and lost in brown, I feared my brush\\'s tip would never again glisten with bright paint. Had my parents not transferred me to an international school, it may never have done so. The school was my ladder. I peeked over the walls, seeing open-minded and openhearted scholars of different colors, personalities and lifestyles. They were obligated to follow no preordained plan. They would be forced into no \\'perfect\\' dollhouse upon graduation.Initially, I sought the benefits of my culture, wishing to restore the color to my walls. But once out of the cave, the shadows on the walls didn\\'t satisfy me anymore. Rather than trying to push the barriers away, I chose to break them down.Why keep quiet if I have my mind to speak? Why settle for what\\'s expected when the world offers so much more? Why forego the pleasure of learning in favor of an oppressed lifestyle?I challenged everything I was once force-fed. I asserted my rights as a young woman, challenging my prescribed role and duties to those around me. I challenged the Allah I was taught to fear.I now choose bold, risky colors, no longer afraid to defy cultural norms.Imagine a thick stroke of risky red across my canvas...I prioritize education over the desperate search for a husband to serve...virgules of intrepid green dancing over the red...In the gender-blind utopia that is my international school, I take all opportunities I am presented with...splotches of vivid blue peppering the span of my painting.I assume the leadership positions reserved for men in my cultureIn the midst of rebelling against what I was not, I found what I wanted to be. Somehow, the chaotic shapes and colors on the painting that was my life seemed to link together into one, whole me. Eventually, my aggression to destroy the foisted norms subsided into fascination with those who accepted them willingly.This new-found preoccupation with human nature enveloped me. I began to understand how our cultural context influenced our individual behavior. I studied sociology and psychology, discovering theories of social schemas and conformity.My hostility towards those forcing teenagers into incestuous marriages became a desire to help the young victims. I volunteered at hospitals and schools to nurse their deformed offspring. I formed a team, proudly labeled the \\'Healthy Future Project\\', to end our nation\\'s all too common practice of inbreeding. My tool? Education.My canvas now has shades of selfless yellow contrasting my previously self-centered choices. This painting that is my life is not, nor will it never be, complete.Had my lips not been sealed from birth, they might not have opened this wide when the seals were broken. My private rebellion against my community\\'s dictatorial ideologies is a decision I\\'ll never regret and is one I\\'d repeat, if presented with the opportunity. It was the most vital turning point in my lifetime. \"}, {\"index\": 731, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  I always thought acting exercises made people look silly. I wouldn\\'t be caught dead doing \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018mah mah\\'s or those stupid \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018eooeoo\\' sounds. These feelings posed quite a dilemma for me when I started performing in shows. I received my first big role during my freshman year as a sassy, antagonistic bird in Seussical the Musical. At the start of every day\\'s rehearsal, the directors would ask the cast to make some weird noises, repeat odd phrases, or participate in some very out there improv games. In order not to compromise my personal beliefs, I\\'d simply pretend to make the sounds with everyone else or \\'accidentally\\' miss my turn for the games. I refused to look as ridiculous as everyone else did. For my first leading role, it was probably the worst experience I could have had. I wasn\\'t getting any positive feedback. Yes, I was hitting all the notes and learning my choreography, but my acting was subpar. I can clearly recall one of my directors saying, \\'You\\'re technically not doing anything wrong\\\\u2026it\\'s just not entertaining. Like I wouldn\\'t want to watch your parts of the show.\\' His words sucker punched me right in the jaw. This made me doubt my abilities even more than I already did. Every motion I made onstage became calculated and unnatural. Acting, what used to be the only thing I looked forward to in the day, now riddled me with anxiety. The show turned out fine, which is not an adjective one should use about something they should be proud of. I did everything I was told and I received a lot of praise from the audience. The issue was that I wasn\\'t happy with the show I\\'d put on. No matter what people told me, I felt that I\\'d let everyone down by not being all that I knew I could be. For the next show, I resolved to make changes. No more \\'I don\\'t want to look like an idiot\\' at rehearsals. No more asking \\'What if everyone else doesn\\'t think I\\'m funny or talented or creative?\\' Worrying so much about how people perceived me ended up making their perceptions of me worse than they probably would have been. I was lacking confidence and I made it my sole mission to get some. For the 9 other shows I\\'ve been in since then, I\\'ve done every single acting exercise. I get down on all fours and moo without question. I speak in a New Jersey accent while walking like a pregnant woman. Actors, despite how you may personally feel about them, are undeniably brave. They don\\'t worry about looking one way or another. They give everything they have with unwavering conviction. I realized that if I could put myself out there in front of the rest of my cast and then onstage, I could also do it in my everyday life. I\\'d tried acting in the first place because I wanted to be anyone other than myself. Having that as my end goal didn\\'t make me perform well and it certainly didn\\'t make me feel better about myself. Acting has transformed itself into a way for me to be a better version of me all the time. I\\'d always felt there was this extrovert clawing at my insides, trying to find its way out. There\\'s absolutely nothing wrong with being introverted, but I knew that wasn\\'t who I was. I\\'d been letting my fears cast a shadow over my actual personality. I\\'ve finally let go of my constant fear of judgement because I\\'ve accepted its inevitability. This has made me a better actress and an overall happier person. I\\'ve learned it\\'s better to embrace the absurdity. After all, what is life if not one big improv game? \"}, {\"index\": 732, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] UC ApplicationPersonal Statement 1I have always been curious about the world around me and was lucky enough to grow up surrounded by people who encouraged that curiosity. I dive into subjects I\\'m curious about. Curiosity about how people got their names inspired me to build a website with a survey to research their origins and impacts (http://www.yournameyourstory.org/). When I became frustrated waiting for a sequel to one of Rick Riordan\\'s Greek mythology books, I wrote two full-lengths sequels of my own (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7001163/1/Son-of- Neptune). Because I loved Greek and Roman mythology so much, I even began researching and writing a historical fiction book (incorporating mythology, of course) on the Trojan War. It was while pursuing my curiosity about stars that I discovered my love for learning about the universe.At the age of seven, I looked up at the stars and decided I wanted to be an astronaut. I devoured books about space, about stars, galaxies, and supernovae and asked for more. My curiosity has only grown;\\\\u037e from Coursera classes \\'Introduction to Astronomy\\' and \\'From the Big Bang to Dark Energy,\\' I learned fascinating and incredible things that boosted my passion for exploring the universe.This summer, I had the opportunity to work with Professors Djorgovski and Mahabal at the Caltech astrophysics department. My apprenticeship was part of an Institute for Educational Advancement program in Southern California that allows students to work with mentors in a broad variety of subjects. I created virtual tours on an application called the Worldwide Telescope, which use data and images from different telescopes to introduce various astronomical concepts. I also worked with python, writing programs modeling celestial interactions - for example, calculating the gravitational attraction between objects in the solar system. This was fascinating because it was the first time I\\'d actually made something astronomy-related. Truly being a part of the process of research and discovery was amazing.My mentors and the undergraduates working at Caltech were extremely welcoming and friendly, and all were very passionate about their work. This experience, in addition to exposing me to working in an astrophysics department, also broadened my understanding of physics and the universe. It began to lay a solid foundation on which I will continue to build my knowledge of physics.Today, I recognize that astrophysics has had the strongest pull on my desire to explore and discover. At the University of California, I know I will take every opportunity I can to learn and to further our understanding of the universe. As a student, I want to join the astrophysics community and help discover amazing new phenomena.Personal Statement 2I stand hand in hand with my fellow actors as we bow to the small audience, who are clapping enthusiastically. We have just performed Pushkin\\'s Eugene Onegin for the second and last time, and as our teacher comes out to thank different people (mostly parents) who helped out with costumes and props, I can\\'t help but feel that this is a community that has been changing me for the better. I am fourteen years old.My parents moved to the United States from the former Soviet Union, my mom when she was only ten, my dad when he was in college. I learned Russian before I learned English, and I wanted to hold on to that connection. Though by age twelve I hardly remembered how to read or write Russian anymore, I insisted on joining the Russian-language theater group. Performing plays in Russian proved to be a huge challenge, yet it has improved my reading, writing, speaking, and understanding of the Russian language and culture enormously. We have read and performed works by Ostrovsky, Chekhov, Pushkin, and many others. In addition to reading and staging plays, we read, write, and perform short stories for each other.This theater group has also helped me grow as a person - I am now more willing to take risks, to speak out when I have something to say, and to try new things. When we performed The Naked King, I was, to my surprise, cast as the princess - the main female role. I had only been in the group for two years, while many of the others had been there since kindergarten. I didn\\'t understand why our director would want me to play the lead role. Now I know that it was to expand not only my acting skills but to help me become more outspoken and more confident in myself. The experience of taking on this role cemented the fact that I could get out of my corner and do anything I wanted. I realized that I could chart my own route and shape my life any way I want to along the way.Though at first I was shy, quiet, and had almost no confidence in myself, I came to realize that there was something very special about this small circle of people. We encouraged each other to take risks, to step outside the boundaries of convention, to forget about looking silly or stupid and to just do it. And so I came out of my shell, slowly at first, but gaining speed as time went on. I am proud of the ways in which I improved not only my Russian language skills, but my attitude and self-esteem as well.I want to open similar worlds of opportunity for others, and am striving to create this kind of community as president of Staged Reading Society. I hope I can always inspire people around me to take risks and pursue opportunities that will help them grow. \"}, {\"index\": 733, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn was my Disney World. While other children my age dreamed of visiting the land of Mickey Mouse and magic, I was happier with exhibition chess matches and matzo balls the size of my head. I always looked forward to following Shore Boulevard along Sheepshead Bay while holding my grandfather\\'s hand. I wanted to venture far from our starting point, but Grandpa would make us turn around before Holocaust Memorial Park. We would retrace our steps, passing the amateur fishermen and chatting dog walkers on our way to the warmth and bustle of Pembroke Street.  Two Saturdays each month, my family would spend the day with my Polish grandparents in their Brooklyn home. My experiences there followed a set routine: Grandma made enough food to feed an army while Grandpa and his \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018tateleh\\' \\\\u2014 that was me \\\\u2014 played chess in my dad\\'s old bedroom. While my childish mind held an idyllic view of my grandparents\\' identities, as I grew older, I began to lose my youthful optimism. My grandparents\\' health began to decline, barring us from partaking in the same activities we used to. Now, instead of continuing to appreciate my loving elders, I lamented the loss of the way things used to be. I could not comprehend how they were able to maintain such unshakeable positivity in the face of hardship and hopelessness\\\\u2014 that is, until I visited the scene of their greatest struggle. Last summer, my Spanish teacher led a group of students through Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, and Austria. We saw all of the major sights on the route, such as the Brandenburg Gate, Hungarian Parliament, and Sch\\\\u00f6nbrunn Palace. However, the imposing monuments and royal residences were not what made the trip so worthwhile.En route to Krakow from Prague, we stopped in the Polish village of Oswiecim, a gray town that sits atop an eerie network of abandoned train tracks. Oswiecim is more commonly known by its German name: Auschwitz. Our tour of the Holocaust-era extermination camp was a personal watershed moment. Walking through sites of unspeakable horror, horror that my grandparents\\' witnessed firsthand, was surreal. I knew about their connection to the Holocaust, but had never felt it so strongly. I pictured my grandmother who made feasts for every holiday not even having enough food for herself. I saw my gentle, loving grandfather being forced to trade his ordinary life for a career as a Polish Resistance fighter. While the barracks of the camp cast imposing shadows on the grounds, the rustling of willow trees and scattered purple wildflowers endowed the scene with a serene beauty. Even after unspeakable atrocities have decimated the landscape, glimpses of purity and hope remain. I left this dreamscape with a new understanding of happiness\\' fluid definition and its manifestation as peace and cultural preservation for the grandparents I had perceived as congenial and folksy, and little else.I acquired a new appreciation for my family that day. I had never before considered my elders to be individuals with complex lives and multifaceted identities. This experience altered not only my view towards my grandparents, but my outlook on interpersonal relations as well. Prior to my journey, I would compartmentalize individuals into easy-to-grasp categories based on first impressions and readily-available information. Now, I understand that face value conclusions regarding people, conflicts, and relationships are not very valuable at all. Tragedy and fortune will always coexist. It is up to the individual to strike a balance between them. My grandparents successfully found this state of equilibrium, allowing the course of history to bring them together in the United States. At first glance, their deteriorating health posed an obstacle to the maintenance of our relationship; however, there are many layers to every story. Pushing my grandfather\\'s wheelchair along Sheepshead Bay two Saturdays each month was not a burden, but a blessing.  \"}, {\"index\": 734, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] It simply did not make sense. How can fifty million Americans go to bed hungry every night? That question haunted me and continues to do so today. I knew people were starving in the third world, but the number of hungry people in America shocked me. As a freshman I became aware of hunger through my school\\'s Community Service Organization. However, the facts I learned posed more questions than they answered. I knew the food drives and bake sales we organized were going to help where it was greatly needed, but I did not understand where the money we raised or the food we collected was going to and why it needed in the first place. During my sophomore year these questions continued to badger me and I decided it was time to start searching for some answers myself. I knew the first thing I needed to do was see hunger in person. I started volunteering at a food pantry just eleven blocks north of my school for the dinner service. I presumed that after working at the pantry I would be able to understand America\\'s hunger problem because it would give a face to the issue: there existed a certain set of qualities or attributes that hungry people had, for a link that connected these fifty million people had to exist. After working for a year at the food pantry I had more questions than ever. I could not find one unifying attribute with the clients at the pantry. I expected people who were disconnected from society: the stereotypical drug abusers, homeless, or mentally ill. The food pantry regulars included some large families, others alone, the elderly and teenagers, couples and single mothers, and most appeared as though they came straight from work. Nothing about the demographic made sense.In my sophomore U.S. History class we were assigned to write our term paper on any event in the past century that changed the course of U.S. History. I chose to write about the war on hunger in the 1960s. I was surprised to discover that there had been a period in our country\\'s history in which people were out protesting on the streets against hunger. If the number of people suffering from hunger has jumped from ten million to fifty million people today, why aren\\'t people rioting?I was infuriated that we were moving backwards on this issue. We have demonstrated that we have the power and resources to fix this problem, but we have chosen not to. At the beginning of my junior year I started serving as the junior co-head of my school\\'s Community Service Organization. I did not want to just organize fundraisers and drives, but I also wanted to educate our members about hunger along with the other issues we raised money for. I set up groups to volunteer at the same food pantry I had worked at for the past year on weekends. During our meetings I shared clips from the documentary A Place at the Table and lectured about the history and current state of hunger in our country. As a senior and co-head of the club there is nothing more rewarding than seeing other girls from my school who previously had no interest in this issue become passionate about ending it.The more involved I become in the struggle against hunger the more committed I feel to this cause. I firmly believe that through the right education and government action we are capable of eradicating hunger in this country. This is a solvable problem. We need a new war on hunger, not a new war in Iraq.  \"}, {\"index\": 735, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]             \\'Without balance, you have nothing.\\' My fencing coach has taught me many things, but this is by far the most important. He demonstrated it during my very first lesson, when he nearly toppled me over with merely a light push on the shoulder as I stood in the en garde position. Although I quickly found my balance while fencing, it wasn\\'t as easy to find balance in the rest of my life.         My family is Korean, but I grew up American. My parents separated when I was four years old, and just a few months later, I moved halfway around the world, from Seoul, South Korea, to New York City. That was the last time I ever saw my mom, hugged her, and kissed her. I was instead raised by a single, immigrant father without a college degree. He worked long hours, seven days a week, so I spent a lot of time alone. Sunday nights became my favorite night of the week during the first few years we spent in New York because it was the night my dad came home the earliest, and he would always take me to the Korean-style Chinese restaurant to order black bean paste noodles and tangsuyuk (sweet and sour beef).         However, these nights were some of the only times when I was exposed to Korean culture, and despite my dad\\'s efforts, my Korean identity slowly slipped away to be replaced with an American one. I have assimilated too well into American society, my dad says. I used to cringe at my dad\\'s thick accent as he thanked my teachers at parent-teacher conferences, but my dad is just as disappointed that my Korean is stilted with a choppy American accent. He often remarks, \\'What kind of Korean doesn\\'t even speak Korean?\\' In response, I would sometimes think, \\'Maybe I\\'m not Korean.\\'         When I was in fifth grade, my grandmother made me kimbap\\\\u2014white rice and a combination of other ingredients, such as vegetables, meat, and fish, rolled together with dried seaweed\\\\u2014for lunch every day. I hated it. All of my friends had paper bag lunches, while I came to lunch with a square Tupperware container. They would unpack their bags, revealing peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with the crusts cut off, juice boxes, colorful fruit roll-ups, and goldfish crackers. I would lift up the lid from my container as slowly as possible, just as you would gradually uncap a shaken soda bottle in the futile hope that it wouldn\\'t erupt, but no matter how slowly I moved, our entire lunch table would always be assaulted by the fishy stench of warm imitation crab meat. Eventually, I became so embarrassed that I stopped bringing a packed lunch to school, resorting instead to the free cafeteria food. It didn\\'t even matter to me that I actually liked kimbap. I was so focused on not being Korean when I should have been focused on simply being myself.         It\\'s only in retrospect that I came to realize this, but once I did, I began to appreciate and even share my Korean heritage. However, this doesn\\'t mean I have completely renounced my American side. After all, I\\'ve lived here for nearly my entire life. Instead, I have bridged the two cultures. At home, I speak \\'Konglish,\\' a mix of Korean and English: I will start a sentence in English, but end in Korean. On weekends, I take my friends to Koreatown for lunch, where we share kimbap and rice cakes, and in exchange, they bring me to their favorite pizza joints. I have found a balance in my life, just as I now stand unwaveringly whenever my coach pushes my shoulder. Because by blood I am Korean, in mind I am American, and at heart I am Korean-American. \"}, {\"index\": 736, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] What\\'s a Real Job Anyway?Throughout my years in high school I have had the privilege\\\\u2014or perhaps the misfortune\\\\u2014of holding a job most people love to hate: ice hockey referee. I vividly remember one Saturday afternoon in particular. As soon as I met the coach for the visiting team, I knew it was going to be a long game. His hoarse voice suggested he had spent many years screaming at officials from his place on the bench, a suspicion that was quickly confirmed after his team gave up a goal following a penalty call I had made. As I skated to the scorer\\'s box to report the point, the coach rasped \\'stripes\\' goal!\\' as if to suggest that it was my fault. Of course, the rest of the game was more of the same. The first few times this happened, I pretended to not hear the coach in an effort to seem confident. Inwardly, though, I wondered if I had really made the right call. As a younger official, I often arrived at the rink very early so that I wouldn\\'t encounter any spectators or coaches before it was absolutely necessary. I felt that my officiating bag somehow marked me as \\'that ref\\' who would soon be the target of everyone\\'s verbal abuse. This strategy had only limited success, as nothing I could do, short of skipping work, could delay the inevitable meeting with the coaches. Even during games, I would often ignore them altogether, which did nothing to reduce their frustration.To many people, officiating doesn\\'t seem like a real job. Yet, in many ways, I have acquired a more important set of real-world skills than have my peers working in restaurants, fast food joints, and supermarkets, and I have made a number of important realizations about both my position, and myself. Of course, I have come to accept that on the ice I can\\'t satisfy everyone in the rink all the time. Coaches, players, and fans are all biased in favor of their teams, which makes it impossible for me to call penalties with which everyone agrees. This knowledge has traveled with me from the ice into the real world, and has changed how I feel about the opinions of others. I know that my actions can never please everyone, which has given me the confidence to do what I think is right, even if it isn\\'t the most popular choice. As a teenager, my position among referees is unique. Many players, some of whom may even know me personally, feel that they don\\'t have to listen to someone who looks just like one of them, and coaches are more inclined to yell and use words such as \\'kid\\' as insults to try to undermine my authority or intimidate me. Faced with what is seen by many as a disadvantage has only forced me to change the way I carry myself. I know that every move and call I make is under the closest scrutiny, and I know that I must be confident in everything I do on the ice, as any weakness simply serves as ammunition for coaches and fans. Off the ice, this drives me to make the best calls, as well as to have the confidence to stand behind my decisions, even in the face of adversity. As my views of myself and my officiating have changed over the past few seasons, I have realized that screaming coaches and other problems in life can be dealt with similarly. No longer do I try to hide from either, as that both frustrates coaches, and makes me look unsure of my decisions. These days, I arrive at the rink no earlier than I need to, and whenever a coach yells at me, I look him in the eye with confidence and know that yes, I made the right call. \"}, {\"index\": 737, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family.The spotlights focus on my face. The microphone lets off a squeal of feedback as I bring my mouth to it. We\\'re Granite. We\\'re from Madison. My foot slams a fuzz pedal, and we explode with a sonic wall of cymbals and chords.Whenever my dad would play me his favorite King Crimson album from college, or my in-the-know friends would introduce me to some new breakout band, I\\'d get a rush of inspiration. I wanted it to be me up on that stage or in that studio, creating music that would bring joy to others. When we started Granite, we were just seventh graders in a basement trying to teach ourselves our instruments by playing sloppy Strokes covers. But over time, my friend Grant and I honed our skills and crafted a style that worked best for us: a two-man, guitar-and-drums garage rock force to be reckoned with. In the midst of developing our style, both of us began to write songs. We both played guitar and drums. To balance our individual artistic interests, we were forced to come up with an unorthodox compromise. We each acted as frontmen, and we would incorporate the switching of instruments into the music itself.I never felt nervous playing middle school talent shows. I\\'d been performing violin recitals since kindergarten. I had experience with public speaking. I was comfortable on a stage. But when Grant and I were playing our music in dimly lit dive bars at the age of fourteen, I couldn\\'t help feel a little out of my element. Yet I never let it scare me. I relished the excitement of playing at places like Mickey\\'s Tavern, alongside a punk band from Chicago that catered to a middle-aged, leather-jacketed, slightly drunken crowd.When you\\'re in a band, you don\\'t have a coach or a teacher. You\\'re completely on your own to set goals and achieve them. At times over the years, it was difficult to stay motivated. Months would drag by without us writing a new song or playing a show. Because we weren\\'t part of any club or organization, there was no penalty for failing. We learned to find inspiration purely out of our own desire to succeed, and when we were able to channel that drive, it paid off. We refined our setlists, scrutinizing which songs stayed, which ones needed work, and which ones needed to be ditched. We sent dozens of emails to venues and networked to build a fanbase and establish contacts. In 2013, our demo CD landed us a gig playing an opening set at the High Noon Saloon, the biggest music bar in town. Almost immediately afterwards, the venue contacted us to book another show. Eventually we found a local technical college that would give us free studio time. We completed all the initial tracking for our album in one frantic 10 hour day. This past summer, as I spent hours tweaking the levels and effects of the songs to get the perfect final mix, I took some time to really listen to all the lyrics Grant and I had written over the past few years. They traced a timeline from when we were just kids to when we were preparing to become adults. The album was a journey. The emotions conveyed through the words and melodies told the story of two kids struggling to find their place in the world. I realized how important this band was to my development. It forced me to compromise, to deal with failure on my own, and to motivate myself when no one was there to hold my hand. Music may not be what I want to do as a career, but it\\'s something I love. The skills and maturity I\\'ve learned from Granite will serve me well for all the other things I\\'ll do in my life. \"}, {\"index\": 738, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] An emergency landed my grandma in the hospital. The problem was an open slit in the tracheoesophageal membrane; food and drink reached her lungs, causing difficulty breathing. The doctors suggested implanting stents into her trachea and esophagus, tiny mesh tubes that would close off the connection. Like on a bumpy roller coaster, her health slowly improved and then suddenly worsened, on a steep decline. After one last drop, doctors told us it was only a matter of time. We called everyone to see her. I can still remember the tense atmosphere in the overcrowded patient room, the awkward glances, anxious dialogue, nervous coughs, and reddened eyes as we sat, crushed under the gravity of the situation. As the only fluent English speaker, I stayed at the hospital during the day and went home only to sleep at night; this was my life from the first ambulance ride to the moment her heart stopped beating. Ever since birth, my grandma adored me, partly because I was the son of her youngest and favorite child. Every day after school, a delicious bowl of noodles sat on the table, waiting for me to devour it. When I was a newborn baby, she bathed me for weeks until my mother regained her strength. Every tiny glance at me was paired with a big smile; every time I held her hands, her muscles unclenched and relaxed. Needless to say, we had a special bond. Before that month, my main goal in life as a simple teenage boy was to play as many hours of video games I physically could before school started again. Selfish, immature, puerile thoughts motivated my actions. From birth, I was fed, bathed, and cared for by my family, with no real effort of my own. I lacked my own conscience and autonomy; sixteen years after birth, my self-sufficiency was akin to a newborn baby. But those days were gone. I had been shielded from suffering, death, and evils of reality by my family\\'s careful protection, and now it was my turn to return the deed. By taking responsibility  and sharing the others\\' burdens, I crossed the imaginary line from adolescence to adulthood. No longer did I have the luxury of strolling on a smooth, paved sidewalk; it was now my turn to hike the trail, to trip, to scrape my knees against the rocks and feel pain, unfiltered. My family sensed an unspoken capacity for leadership in me, and I too soon felt the same hidden power. When she died, I was alone with her. I like to think that I was special to my grandma. I like to romanticize that out of all the times to succumb to death\\'s embrace, she chose to die when she was alone with me. She sensed that I was mature enough to perpetuate her legacy, and so I would become the final witness to her everlasting image. Every day, I close my eyes and bow three times to a portrait of her. \"}, {\"index\": 739, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] There is a hefty blue book in my bookcase that is older than any other book in the house. Across its spine are emblazoned the words My First Encyclopedia. For others this book might have served as a passing interest or an occasional point of reference; for me, it was the quiet, unremarked, yet vastly monumental introduction into a life shaped by the tenets of science.Science is interdisciplinary. The Encyclopedia introduced me to topics ranging from Julius Caesar to the Big Bang Theory, and I have not ceased to learn ever more in all those topics. Science, by nature, encourages inquiry; my life-long inquiry has, as much as I can manage, reached into every aspect of the world. Literature and history in particular have been paramount in forming my ability and motivation to explore the possibilities of science. It was through the passionate invocations and philosophical ponderings of the Romantic writers that I understood the depth of my own dedication to science and gained the skills to write an organized research paper. And for what purpose do I live, if not for the betterment of society, to which the history of its people alone has given meaning?Science is logical and resourceful. No matter how many wondrous things the encyclopedia introduced me to, I accepted them because they made sense. Logic is my first resort during emergencies, and it has served me well on a number of occasions. For instance, my family and I once, while vacationing in Greece, found ourselves on a side road where all the signs and maps were in the Greek alphabet. No passerby spoke English. As my aunt began to fret, I sought out a nearby map, and realized that the characters were not altogether unfamiliar to me. I recalled them from numerous formulas taught in physics and statistics lessons, and, rather delighting in the puzzle that faced me, I began to work through the various street names on the map, hoping to deduce the one that matched our hotel\\'s address. It was my recollection of the micrometer abbreviation and the symbol of wavelength that finally illuminated the way, allowing me to confidently lead my family through the unfamiliar streets of Athens.Science is gradual but passionate. I realized this principle most markedly in my experience in research. Despite the Encyclopedia having instilled an early love for science within me, I was not yet certain in my choice to pursue a career in the subject when I first entered ninth grade research class. As the years passed, I progressed from simple background investigations in class to devoting entire summers and weekends to laboratory research. The work was long and hard, but I persevered because I loved being able to finally contribute something new \\\\u2013 something of my own to the scientific community by publishing papers and presenting conclusions; and because I knew I had the determination and integrity to succeed. Now, having experienced the challenge, the rewards \\\\u2013 the sheer magnificence of research, I cannot live without it, no matter how difficult it may become. Research awakened me to the reality of a career in science: it will be extremely demanding, just as it will be extremely fulfilling.There are two chapters in the Encyclopedia that have stuck with me through all these years. The first is entitled \\'How Babies Grow\\', which unveiled to my seven-year old self the possibilities and practicalities of medicine; the second chapter is on literature, and features a portrait of Victor Hugo. Years after I first read that chapter, I read Les Miserables, and there is one line that I will never forget for the unrealized ideals it represents: \\'The nineteenth century is great, but the twentieth century will be happy.\\' If through application of the pragmatics of science I can help realize this dream in our century, then I would count my life a worthy investment of books and micropipettes. \"}, {\"index\": 740, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] In 1947, my grandpa moved from China to Cambodia, where he started a small convenient store. Two years later, he met my grandma and they started a family. They lived there happily for twenty years until the Cambodian Holocaust. The entire Tan family was forced to gather only a few belongings and escape on foot.They reached Vietnam, where they decided to settle and open a bakery. The bakery was a family business, so everyone was required to help. Besides working, my aunts and uncles also had to go to school because my grandparents saw education as the path to a brighter future. After 14 years of living in Vietnam, they heard about America, the land of opportunities, and decided to gather their belongings once more. Around 1993, my family found a home in America. My aunts and uncles attempted to continue their education, though only a couple succeeded, primarily due to the language barriers. &quot;If I could go back, I would go to college and learn English&quot; and &quot;I wish I was born in the US so I could\\'ve gotten a better education,&quot; my mother constantly reminds me. With so many children, my grandparents could never afford to send them all to school. My mother wasn&#39;t able to continue her education and had to work. Now, she tells me it\\'s her deepest regret. My family didn&#39;t really have a chance to continue their education after emigrating. They all worked blue collar jobs; leaving early, coming home late, but not really earning much. Growing up, my parents did everything they could to better my education. &quot;Go to tutoring.&quot; &quot;Do your homework.&quot; &quot;Do you need help with anything?&quot; Being an only child, the pressure really gets to me. I know my parents are depending on me to take care and provide for them in their old age.When my parents decided to move out of an apartment and buy a house, they took into consideration the school I would be attending. When the time came to apply for high school, they took the day off to go to open houses with me to make sure I applied to the best school. They make so many sacrifices for me just to ensure that I live the life they wanted but never got. My parents inspire me to dream big and never quit. Back in Vietnam, my grandparents didn&#39;t know if they would even make it to America, but they tried anyway. They didn&#39;t know what kind of life they would be leading in America, but they knew it would open more doors for the future.My family emigrated from China to Cambodia to Vietnam, and finally to America. Not many people are able to say that they survived the Cambodian Holocaust. Through all that they have been through, they have never given up. My family has taught me to persevere through difficulties and to never give up until I reach my objectives. I want to add to the family legacy of dreaming big to accomplish our goals; my struggles and success will be the next chapter of our lineage. \"}, {\"index\": 741, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 742, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Everyone was gunning for me: I was the red-and-white target everyone wanted to shoot. When I finished 9thgrade at the very top of my class, I felt proud but ostracized. My peers wanted nothing to do with me. I tried toapproach them, but they built walls around themselves, walls that I couldn\\'t fully comprehend. I was told that someof my friends had spoken to several teachers, complaining that it was unfair that I was getting such good gradesdespite being absent so often. It seemed as though they thought everything was easy for me, which could nothave been further from the truth.My immune system at the time was incredibly weak. I missed a whole month of school due to a particularly strongcase of mononucleosis and a bad mycoplasma infection. Spending my days in hospital beds and doctors\\' offices, Ifocused on schoolwork as a temporary escape from what was going on in my life. I was struggling with my health,an alarming 30-pound weight loss, and my parents\\' separation. At the same time, my own obsession with beingperfect aggravated my problems. I found myself unable to come to terms with the fact that I had so many things inmy life that needed fixing. The problems themselves weren\\'t my failure, of course; it was my self-deprecationregarding them.Each Lent, my family sets goals of personal growth in preparation for Easter. I took my 10th-grade year as anopportunity to turn my situation around. During the forty days preceding Easter, I decided to write down five thingsI was grateful for each day: \\'I won a tennis match.\\' \\'I am a doer.\\' \\'I played a piano solo.\\' \\'I spent time with mygrandparents.\\' As time went by, five things were not enough. I started filling out entire pages with reasons assimple yet honest as being able to put on my socks.Being involved in lots of extracurricular activities forced me to be in constant interaction with people. At a DaleCarnegie Public Speaking course, I shared my personal story with everyone, and my voice cracked with emotionas I spoke. I felt vulnerable and insecure, but then other students shared their own troubles as well. It dawned onme that we were are all going through a storm behind the scenes. Not a single one of us had the perfect life I wasstriving for.A few months later, when I performed in front of hundreds of people for the Destination Imagination Global Finals,my self-confidence was beginning to show. The contagious energy of the participants prompted me to look at abench, say \\'Why not?\\' and jump over it, or to look at a handsome boy, ask myself \\'If not now, then when?\\' andsay hello. It surprised me to realize how much I enjoyed striking up conversations with people I had just met. Manyof these conversations quickly turned intellectual or philosophical - I was suddenly learning from people as muchas I usually did from books!In time, I bounced back from my troubles, regained the weight I had lost, never again missed school due tosickness, and ended up making many good friends. I had proved to myself that I could thrive in a collaborativeenvironment. My improved emotional and social intelligence also gave me a strong desire to make a positivedifference in the lives of others. It sparked my participation in social outreach programs - I even started a project ofmy own to help malnourished children in Guatemala. Perhaps one of my greatest lessons came from realizing thatproblems are a given, but failure is a choice. \"}, {\"index\": 743, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I have always found the bold dissonance of eveningwear striking. The pristine marble shirt contra the blacker-than-black midnight blue dinner jacket reduce the theme of the outfit to a surreal simplicity. Neither displaces any beauty from the other, but rather both coalesce into harmony. The acclivous U of the waistcoat endows a seamless elegance in the attire, while the marginally asymmetric knot of what should always be a hand-tied bow tie lends the whole ensemble a human feel. In this uniform, the important things stand out. Personalities pop against such a stark backdrop. Among equals, differences all wax apparent.Such attire is confined to the ballroom and late night parties, but I try to carry something of it with me into the day. I modify my dress. Instead of a dinner jacket, I wear a blazer. Like with eveningwear, I follow the age-old traditions associated with such clothes. There are rules most people over look, like the one saying a tie clip must be placed in between the second and third button. Although such differences may seem petty, I pay attention to the details because it makes me feel as if I am tapping into some sense of human heritage, some shared culture. But, I am not a slave to tradition and rules; I work within them to find my own style. I create myself through my clothes and they take on a deep metaphysical meaning for me.\\\\u2028As I dress, I suspend the convolution of the world and like the colors I don, it all transforms into black and white. I order a chaotic world. I line up my thoughts, and then they begin to make sense. This is my assertion, my small act of rebellion. Not a revolution, something subtler, something deeply personal. It cannot be contained. The rebellion spreads to every aspect of my life. I refuse to define myself. Instead of identity, I substitute being. I am willing to live without certainty. This is my leap of faith. I do not need some grand, existential meaning given to me. Whether that meaning itself exists is of no matter. I draw my worth from something else\\\\u2014 from the struggle to surmount. I take it from the process of overcoming. I erect myself as a monument, a landmark to myself. This is not arrogance, but rather a commitment to an existential cogency. I pit myself against my questions knowing that perhaps I will find no answers. I stand against the challenges I face in life, not for the sake of achievement, but for the inertial, recursive meaning it gives to me. Secure in this, I will stay my course. Like Sisyphus with his rock, I will persevere.  \"}, {\"index\": 744, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] One of the most important and influential figures in my life has been my maternal grandmother. Although less than five feet tall, my grandmother is a towering figure who personifies an unstoppable work ethic. Her example has exerted a huge influence on my personal and academic life.My grandmother was born in a small town in Durango, Mexico more than 80 years ago, and only completed school through the sixth grade (the highest level offered). She migrated to Mexico City where she met and married my grandfather, jointly ran a restaurant with him, and had four children (the youngest being my mom). Tragically, my grandfather was killed by a bus in Mexico City when my mom was only 13. Despite this loss, my grandmother worked tirelessly to run the restaurant by herself so that my mother and her three older siblings could continue their education, knowing that this would be the key for her children to move up in society and become successful. On the night of my birth, my grandmother traveled to the US so she could be by my mother\\'s side. Since then, she has lived with my family for six months out of every year, residing in Mexico for the other six months. I am in awe of her quiet determination and her incredible work ethic. Every day she wakes up early and works in the garden, cleans, washes, cooks, reads, walks, and helps my family. I am grateful for her hard work and for the fact that she speaks only Spanish, giving me an opportunity to practice and improve my speaking skills in my second language. She also enjoys watching science fiction movies, like Star Trek, which is an interest that we share. I feel it\\'s critical for me to continue my grandmother\\'s legacy of a strong work ethic. I believe I have demonstrated this type of ethic with a 33 point improvement on the PSAT between my sophomore and junior year. My improvement was the result of intense, consistent reading and math practice over a two year period. I think my strong academic record has allowed me to lead by example within my Hispanic community. I have done volunteer work that includes tutoring students in chemistry and translating brochures into Spanish. I am constantly aware that my fellow students know that I am Hispanic, and I feel an enormous sense of pride in being both a National Merit Semifinalist and a National Hispanic scholar. I like to think that in some small way I might be helping my community by excelling in academic pursuits. Being one of the relatively few Hispanic students in advanced classes in my high school (especially math and science classes), I feel a sense of responsibility to perform, represent my ethnicity and lead by example.This summer in Mexico, I interacted with recent college graduates and it opened my eyes to new possibilities, issues, and questions about Mexican society. Young people seem very close to their families, have strong ties to their neighborhoods, and strong ideals about improving themselves. In many of these young people, I saw the same strong work ethic that my grandmother displays. These experiences motivated me to continue developing my leadership skills, to interact with other young leaders, and to expose myself to other cultures abroad. Because of my passion for computer science and my connection to Mexico, I hope to start a business in Mexico. If I succeed, this may benefit the United States in some small way, in that it is important to have a more stable, competitive, and vibrant society south of our border as both a trade partner and diplomatic ally. In becoming an effective leader, I hope to help Mexicans here and abroad, and perhaps even benefit my grandmother by improving the country in which she lives. \"}, {\"index\": 745, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Growing up, I was forced to work in groups in every single class, and as much as I loved laughing along with my friends while finishing my work, I would have much rather done it all on my own. This isn\\'t because I am someone who loathes socializing, but because I am an introvert.    Although there is some negative stigma towards introversion, it has helped shape the person I am today. This has greatly contributed to the strong work ethic and analytical ability I currently possess. Instead of sitting and discussing the work, I chose to sit back, listen, and analyze every intricate detail involved until the answer was perfectly done. I took it upon myself to stay completely focused on my work, leading those around me by example to do the same. In a more recent case, the strong organizational skills and patience I have allow me to be successful both as captain of the Science Olympiad team and as a babysitter. I may not be the most vocal leader in the world, yet I\\'m still working diligently to make sure everything is a complete success. Furthermore, this has also allowed me to become a Senior Editor for the Aspects Literary Magazine. My thoroughness allows me to double check to make sure the magazine is perfectly laid out to everyone\\'s liking, and be an active member in this publication.    The effect of introversion wasn\\'t limited to my academic life, however. At home, I refilled my drained energy from socializing all day and motivated myself to get tasks done without much outside encouragement. Additionally, my introverted father and I would socialize in a completely different way than I would with my mother. Together, we would simply enjoy one another\\'s company in silence while we did other activities on our own. As antisocial as this may seem, this is what allowed us to be closely knit together. Sure, the three of us would have casual conversations like any other family, but the silence and solitude allowed us to be energized.    Although this may make me appear to be a quiet little kid who didn\\'t really talk to his friends, that wasn\\'t true. In fact, being introverted allowed me to develop strong bonds with a variety of people. Since my usual silence allowed me to be a great listener, I was able to remember even the smallest moments and anniversaries. I was also able to give my friends advice based on what they had told me in that moment and the days prior.    Moreover, being an introvert has allowed me to find my niche in running on the cross country and track teams. Since both sports are fairly individual, I am able to gain energy from being on my own while still being a part of a second family. As a senior now, I have found new responsibilities and leadership roles that I can\\'t find anywhere else as well. Whether it\\'s helping plan a breakfast after practice, or helping the captains along the way by leading the others by example, I can still be an active member without being so vocal.    Living as an introvert may have its problems, but at the same time, I don\\'t think I would be the same person as an extrovert. They say a third of the population is an introvert, and I\\'m glad I\\'m in that minority. \"}, {\"index\": 746, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I have the type of personality where I tend to play devil\\'s advocate and challenge people whenever the situation presents itself. When something does not make logical sense, then sometimes I cannot help but argue against it. Because of my challenging nature, many of the arguments are not very significant. However, there is one occasion that took place many years ago that I do not think I will ever forget. It was the first time I truly cared about the reason for the argument. I learned to stand up for my friends and what I believe is right in regards to the way human beings treat one another.   It was the summer after sixth grade when my best friend and I when to the same sleep away camp that we had attended the year before; little did we know that this would be the last time. Although being Christian was not a requirement to attend, Camp Chattooga was considered to be a Christian camp. This did not seem to be an issue for anyone until one day my best friend, Sarah, did not agree with something that was preached to us during an assembly. Now I\\'m not a very religious person, so I did not have too much to say on the topic at first, but I could logically see where she was coming from regarding having free will and the ability to choose your own path in life. The fact that Sarah felt differently did not go over well with any of the girls in our cabin, who all proceeded to surround my friend, telling her that she was wrong and that she must not be a Christian (this really hurt Sarah because her father is a Pastor and her faith is important to her). I could not really blame the girls for doing this because we were all just kids and they only knew what they were taught, but what really made this enough of an issue to make me upset to this day is how the adults responded.  Instead of calling off the lynch mob of young girls, our counselors decided that they should join in. The people who were supposed to be taking care of us and making sure we had a great time were putting down an eleven-year old for having a different opinion. By this point I had already decided to join in with any and all arguing points I could make. I did not like seeing someone get attacked in that way, especially my best friend. As long as they are not being hurtful to others, I do not think that people should be judged or put down for sharing their personal beliefs and opinions. Even if I had not agreed with Sarah, which I did, I would have stood up for her and argued against the majority opinion. Involving myself in the situation was not about trying to disprove anyone\\'s beliefs, but rather about standing up when someone\\'s ideas were not respected in the way they should be.  This moment has remained with me throughout the years because it reminds me to stand up for what is right. I learned what it felt like to have no one want to hear what you have to say or what you think, and it is not a pleasant feeling. I constantly use this experience to remind myself how important it is to keep an open mind and take others seriously because they could have a better way of viewing the world, and unlike the girls at Camp Chattooga, I am always searching for a new perspective on life. Standing up against what I felt was unjust behavior, even though I was going against the popular belief, is not something that I regret doing, and I would make the same decision today in a similar situation.  \"}, {\"index\": 747, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] UC Personal Statement 1 My world is a flurry of paper. Books pile up on the dresser next to the bed and overflow from the bookshelf onto the ground. Papers litter the floor and desk - if the window gets left open they fly like birds. My world is one of exploration and experimentation. The books in my room range from barely touched intellectual books (way over my head), to sappy romance books I\\'m embarrassed about owning, to worn Harry Potter books I\\'ve read a ridiculous number of times. These books contain the many worlds in which I grew up, the sanctuaries I retreated to when I didn\\'t want to deal with the real world. These pages are where I learned about loyalty and friendship and bravery and so much more. Perhaps the most important thing I\\'ve learned is that if I want something to change, I have to act to change it - sometimes sacrifices are necessary and unavoidable. Within the pages of these books I experienced emotions peaking with extreme excitement  and bottoming with crushing sadness. I went on adventures, and I lost people I loved, I made friends, and I made enemies. I grew up moving through these many different worlds, exploring and imagining them. Through these books I gained the ability to forgive and empathize and consider the circumstances of others, and still books help me grow and provide an escape. The papers that float around my room and settle in mountainous piles - which I sometimes worry will suffocate me - around the house tell a different story, a story of experimentation. Each page has the potential to detail an entirely new world or be the beginning of a new adventure. Some ideas never turn into anything more than that - ideas - while others could lead to who knows what, and some are simply lists of things to do. A few are covered in long forgotten math, calculations of probability and the like. Paper and pen have let me release stress, express myself, work through new ideas, and imagine entirely new worlds. Paper and books are what have comforted me and led me through the more difficult parts of life. Books have taught me things and housed the worlds I grew up in, while paper has enabled me to express myself and shape the world I want to live in. Today I want to create and explore and record and change the world for the better. Much like the paper it is made of, my world is constantly changing in new and unexpected ways - folds and damage are inevitable, but everyone knows that destroying a book is the ultimate sin and so the paper worlds I come from will always be there for me. \"}, {\"index\": 748, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 749, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I could go on and on about how I have been mistreated as a girl heavily interested in Calculus and Chemistry, or I could explain that with my parents financial situation I was never able to pursue dancing to the extent that I desire or even apply to an ivy school because of fees, but neither of these obstacles are near as impeding as the one I am overcoming as I write this essay.  Two thousand and fifteen was to be an immense year for myself and my family. My last semester of high school, the beginning of my undergraduate journey, the anniversary of moving Florida; little did we know however, that this would be the year my family battles cancer. In January, both my mother and my aunt were diagnosed with low stages of breast cancer. With these such stages, my family and I didn\\'t necessarily expect the operations and clinic visits and care that was to come. The stress and emotions became absolutely overwhelming, and the phrase \\'some days are better than others\\' became a life motto. Although I assumed, like the naive seventeen year old I am, I could handle everything going on in both my personal and academic life, I could not have been more wrong. I noticed quickly that I began to study and sleep much less than usual, and soon I became so completely enthralled in what was going on at home, that one of the most important aspects of my life, my education, was put on the backburner. With this, I was called to action. I constantly have the desire to learn and I never wish to fail, and I knew that if I kept making excuses for myself, nothing would get done. I have always seemed to work unexpectedly well underneath overwhelming stress, and I finally realized that this situation was simply that. I wish I could say I have overcome this immense obstacle, but until my mother\\'s cancer is completely obliterated, I\\'m not altogether sure I can. This is something not yet over, but I will overcome. With receiving the George W. Jenkins Scholarship, I would be able to fight this battle with my family, and that is something that I absolutely need. Without the financial damage that college would bring upon my family in addition to the already extensive medical costs, I will be able to focus my time on bettering my knowledge, and staying a strong backing for my parents and sister. If I am being upfront, receiving this scholarship will bring me to Florida Southern, and what I can bring to the campus is well worth the amount to be given to me. \"}, {\"index\": 750, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] What do the Pullman strike, a swinging strike (baseball), and a bowling strike have in common?

Glancing quickly at the scoreboard, I take in the situation. Ten seconds left and we are down by two. I look up the court, trying to examine it like a chess board. I quickly note the position of each player, trying to predict what their next move would be. Curling my hand, I signal the play that will make or break our team\\'s season.***I don\\'t believe in magic. Not really. Even so, I have spent many hours over the years sitting before my television or a deck of cards, trying to unearth the secrets of one magic act or another.I still remember recording a particularly fun downtown Hollywood magic show eight years ago. The next morning I put it into the VCR player with the giddy excitement of a child opening a Christmas present. I rewatched the entire act once just for entertainment, and then got down to business. Slowing down the video by three times, I meticulously stared at the screen, taking note of every move and action. I went through the footage frame by frame, searching for the trick, the secret that enabled the magician to cause the coin to pass through the seemingly solid table. Five times I watched the tape, and five times I failed to discover it. It wasn\\'t until the sixth viewing that I noticed the sudden movement on the bottom of the table, an action that would have been missed in real time, but apparent in slow-motion. The table had a small trapdoor! It opened when pressure was applied, allowing the coin to apparently pass through with a smooth tap of the surface. I pumped my fist at the discovery, feeling triumphant.When I first started playing basketball as a third grader, I treated every move like that magic trick, something to be repeated again and again until its secrets and nuances were revealed. Such dogged persistence has served me well over the years. Pop culture would have you believe brilliance emerges out of thin air. But I know that true ingenuity comes from endurance and diligence. I came to view every situation as a puzzle, one that could be solved with enough effort. Persistence applies to every aspect of life; it is the secret of those who make the seemingly impossible look effortless. People have asked incredulously how I dribble and shoot so easily, and the answer is always straightforward: practice. I spend hours dribbling, shooting, and conditioning myself, just so that during my thirty minutes of playing time, I won\\'t lose the ball or miss a layup. Similarly, before I perform any magic trick, I practice my technique repeatedly until it is flawless. I spend hours watching myself, writing down better and more elegant ways to do the same trick, or building contraptions that will ensure perfect execution. ***Back on the court, time seems to be moving in slow motion. \\'Motion! Motion!\\' In the corner of my eye, I see my shooting guard cut to the basket, calling for the ball. He\\'s well covered. Too risky. Instead, I pass it to my center, a 6 foot 2 player with a love for trash talking, standing at the corner of the free throw line. I then make a fake cut, momentarily throwing him out of position. Seeing his mistake of under-coverage, I cut back behind my player, taking the handoff smoothly. Using him as a screen, I elevate and take the shot, making sure my entire body is on balance. I have done this a thousand times before. The ball leaves my fingers smoothly. It passes through the net with a satisfying splash, a sound that is coupled with the horn of the final buzzer.I have never believed in magic. I don\\'t have to.  \"}, {\"index\": 752, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Pre-flight. Zero feet above ground:I have butterflies in my stomach. I am an hour and a half early for my flight, as always, and I have to pretend to be calm and cover the fact that I am bouncing in my seat so my parents will not worry about me flying alone. I get up and walk to a large window through which I can see each plane race down the track as it ends its journey, and I start to wonder which of these planes is the one that would be taking me on my adventure. After I say goodbye to my parents and make my way through security, I am no longer forced to hide my anticipation, but I still try to act like this is no big deal, like I have done this a hundred times before and the fact that I am about to be 36,000 feet above solid ground does not even phase me anymore. Boarding. Zero feet above ground:The butterflies in my stomach have taken over my chest. Why do I always get so anxious? I\\'ve flown before, I should be used to this. I hobble down the aisle and find that my seat, 27A, is one of the only rows in the entire plane with the tacky square fabric design and every other person on this flight has nice new leather seats. Just my luck.In flight. Ascending:With music blasting in my ears, I stare out the window eagerly waiting for my plane to begin its ascent. I feel the plane start to lift itself into the air and suddenly those butterflies that had taken over my body are pushed away, left at the terminal with no chance of returning. I love being in the air, seeing anything and everything all at once. I love the feeling of not knowing exactly what will happen when I step off the plane. As if on cue, my iPhone shuffles to \\'A Whole New World\\' from Aladdin. I long to let my heart decide for me like Jasmine, to open my eyes and see things from a new, fantastic point of view, with no one to say I am only dreaming. Maybe this explains why I was so infatuated with Aladdin as a child. In flight. 32,000 feet above ground:I love having the window seat; however, I absolutely hate my window. I have to turn my whole body and crane my neck to see out of the small square that should not even be considered a window, but I do it anyways. Nothing could compare to seeing the towering buildings of a large city one moment and nothing but rolling fields of soybeans the next. I am so mesmerized by the scenery that I do not even open the book I brought with me, for I am too busy creating my own stories for the lives of those I am passing overhead.The sun begins to set, and I am unable to see where one town ends and one begins; I can no longer admire the calming steadiness of the countryside. Instead, I see lights. Bright lights of larger cities beckoning me to stop and visit. Fainter, almost unnoticeable lights of houses with families who have not yet retired to bed. I curl up in my seat, perfectly content, unable to take my eyes away from the complete darkness. I cannot help but dream of how much else there is to see and learn about in the world. In flight. Descent:This is it. As the plane commences its plunge towards the Earth, the butterflies I thought I had left back at home begin to creep back into my stomach. Once I get off this plane, I will be on my own, completely independent and free to do as I wish, and I could not be more excited. \"}, {\"index\": 753, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Describe a place or environment where you are perfectly content. What do you do or experience there, and why is it meaningful to you?     Loonette the Clown and her \\'dolly Molly\\' sat on \\'The Big Comfy Couch\\'. When I was a child, I would watch daily as they would solve everyday problems while learning life lessons on the titular couch. Back then, I couldn\\'t understand why that couch was so special, or how the idea of the experiences spent on one could merit a television show. My own couch seemed to be all too ordinary and the events that occurred on it not extraordinary in any way.   But, in truth, I practically grew up on my couch. As a child, I spent countless hours there with my friends watching TV, playing board games, and feeling both the joy of victory as well as the bitter taste of defeat at a time when the only troubling issue in my life was the prospect of losing at a game of Uno. However, as I grew older, my experiences on the couch changed--and so did I.    For much of my life, I didn\\'t quite realize what my couch meant to me. That is, until my childhood best friend visited me one day and plopped herself down on the couch. \\'Your couch feels like home to me,\\' she said.  It seemed like such a strange thing to say. But as I reflect on that exchange, all these years later, I realize that she wasn\\'t wrong.     Somewhere along the way, my couch had become more than just the most comfortable seat in my house; it became a base of operations and the place I\\'d automatically go to when I walked through the front door. It was a place of laughter between friends and where the dramas of everyday life would unfold. Countless summer days were spent in it\\'s company. It kept whispered secrets and made a comfortable bed when I would fall asleep to the lullaby of the air conditioner.     My couch was a place of sorrow as well; where tears were shed over lost loved ones and cruel words; where comfort was always given and it seemed as though I could always speak my mind without being judged. It could also be a place to do nothing at all; to sit with those I love and simply be content in their presence. More than anything, my couch was a place of family; where cousins, aunts, and uncles absent for years would return to tell their stories and feel as though they\\'d never left.    My couch is presents on Christmas morning. It is a movie theater when skies grow dark. It is a dinner table more often then not. It is the place where I cried for hours the day my mom told me that when my father walked out the front door, he wasn\\'t coming back.    My couch has been one of the few constants in my life. It is familiar. Though it has been stained and worn from years of sorrow and joy, I know the story behind every flaw. The tears shed have long since dried and now it is only the happy memories that I can see tattooed onto its leather. Many of the things around my couch may have changed; decor and trends come and go, but it never has and a part of me hopes it never does.      I am reaching a crossroad in my life. I will soon part ways with the couch that has brought me such comfort and has watched me grow. It is inevitable. One day soon, I will leave and this constant too shall fade. But I will be fine. I have conquered most of the problems life has thrown at me and taken all there is to take from each experience. I no longer need my couch. The comfort it once provided I have now found within myself, in my own strength. With that knowledge, I can confidently look forward to the future. \"}, {\"index\": 754, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The stone walls and the steel edges do not reflect the beauty and complexity that I see. Most will view it simply as a utility, but to me, our kitchen is a place where my family gathers to cook a meal, where I bake for my friends. It is a place that I will always return to, knowing that there will be cookies to bake. Thanksgiving Day. Thirty-five people scattered around the house, 20 of whom are in the kitchen, mashing potatoes, basting turkey, or baking pies, all holding conversation. As I stand over the cranberry sauce, stirring, stirring, adding orange zest, my grandmother comes over and we discuss the apple pie I made the day before, then my great aunt and I talk about the rafting trip we are planning for next summer. It is a day of family and we are centered in the kitchen. Everyone is hectic, but I focus on my cranberry sauce, stirring, stirring, stirring. It is the dish I have always made and the simplicity of it is bliss. The kids scream, the wine is passed, and everyone is scared that we will not have dinner until 8:00, but amongst this chaos, I feel no disorder, I only stir, stir, stir. My cranberry sauce is done, and I put it in the fridge, playing a game of Tetris with the apple pie and bottles of sparkling cider. I turn around, ready to discuss about my research and where we are going in Portland for beer tasting (root beer for me) the next day. It\\'s 3:30 and I am pulling into my garage, ready to start my homework. I put my backpack on the kitchen counter as my mother reminds me to hang up my jacket. Two hours later I am finished with my work, an hour to spare before Science Olympiad practice. Usually I would go on my computer or read a book, but my club mates have been working hard for our upcoming tournament, so I decide to make my classic chocolate chip cookies for them. 2 \\\\u00be cups of flour 1 teaspoon of baking soda and salt \\\\u00be cup of sugar and brown sugar 2 sticks of butter 2 eggs 1 teaspoon of vanilla 2 \\\\u00bd cups of chocolate chipsWatching the cookies transform in the oven is the best part of the process, when I feel warm and can hardly resist forming a smile. Seventeen and a half minutes later they are ready, perfectly golden, their scent traveling throughout the kitchen and the house; everyone knows when my cookies are ready. I leave three for when I return, then I depart for practice to watch everyone\\'s face as they take a cookie and begin to study. Those are the moments I treasure, when my creations bring happiness to others. Learned from my father and him from his mother, this recipe isn\\'t just about baking cookies, but about continuing a legacy that has brought happiness for decades. My world begins to crumble and I stare into nothingness. I am inadequate. I am isolated. My parents expect greatness, but I deliver less. Their image of a perfect son is perpetuated each day by the expression of their disappointment. I return to the place that is my only cathartic release as a safe haven with no impurities. I carefully add ingredients, only focused on baking with no plan of what to do with the cookies afterwards. The 30-minute process in my kitchen is all it takes for me to be grounded once again. \"}, {\"index\": 755, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] On the first day of summer, I rise before daybreak to compete in San Francisco Bay\\'s first series of sailing races of the season: the BAYS Regatta. This is a big day, I remind myself on the drive there, you\\'ve been preparing for months. As soon as I arrive and rig my boat, I sail out into the stillness to let the crisp ocean air and the serene morning sky awaken my mind.There is nothing in this world more indescribably beautiful than the morning sun casting a glow on the Golden Gate Bridge as it rises through the damp mist. I breathe deeply, wiping off beads of perspiration that appear despite the chilly air, calming my excited nerves. I contemplate my eight years of sailing experience. As the boat creaks through the smooth water, I strategize about the competition, the course, and the limitations of my boat. There is a reason this bay hosts the America\\'s Cup, one of the most famous sailing races on earth. While winds of twenty-five miles per hour don\\'t sound intimidating on paper, they are a force to be reckoned with on the water. I smile and wave to the first few sleepy boats while double-checking my rig and the weather forecast. I grin as I consider the heart-pumping racing that will soon ensue. In my mind, hoards of sailboats come to life, bravely battling the wind yet simultaneously trying to outmaneuver each other tactically. I imagine the adrenaline pumping pace and the thrill of the race, balanced with my long-term strategy.Many people have a strange misconception that sailing is very simple: raise a sail, let it catch a breeze, and it will push your boat. Unfortunately not. Rather, sailing is a delicate balance between Mother Nature and a man-made marvel, a feat that requires skill and thought. The tension of the sail, the tilt of the boat, the angle of the boat with respect to the wind: all of these factors alter the dynamic of the air and water and thus can make or break a sailor. Sailing is where physics and engineering meet practical reality. Racing is the art of strategically tweaking the balance between nature and engineering, the wind and the boat, to optimize speed. It is a massively exhilarating balancing act, like tightrope walking a hundred feet over harsh terrain. A reckless, overconfident sailor who pushes too hard and doesn\\'t observe the wind will only end up offsetting this balance, resulting in a loss of speed or a capsize. It is the thoughtful, observant, and strategically balanced sailor who carries home the trophy.As I sit there on that misty morning, preparing to race, I contemplate the balance that sailing has brought to my life. It has helped me center myself, balancing a tough school workload with the sheer joy of sailing. Years of sailing has taught me that sheer determination and perseverance are sometimes not enough to win and that one has to balance the thrill of the moment with a long term strategy.In the race of life, just like in a sailboat race, time is limited. To best use that time, you have to get up early, start fresh, and plan a strategy. A blind headlong rush will only upset the delicate balance between the wind and the boat. In sailing, and in life, I must strategically balance my desires and my goals. At the break of dawn, on the water, I am content because I can feel that balance. Just as night balances with day, peace and strategy balance with incredible upcoming thrill, I enthusiastically balance with the wind. So, as I watch the morning light spread across the Golden Gate, turning dawn into day and giving the world a fresh new start, I clear my mind, embrace my plan, and prepare to race. \"}, {\"index\": 756, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 757, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 758, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 759, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Family is everything, right? For me, this is especially true. My oldest brother, David, has Asperger\\'s Syndrome. As experts calculated that one out of every 150 babies born in 1995 were born on the Autism spectrum, David had a 0.67 percent chance of having Asperger\\'s. That is, there was a less than one percent chance that he would be excluded and bullied for his eccentricities. There was a less than one percent chance that he would be unable to communicate his extensive knowledge. There was a less than one percent chance that I would have to be a big sister to my older brother. For seventeen years I have lived with and loved my fascinating yet frustrating eldest sibling. I felt sympathy for him, but also admiration. I was amazed by his ability to choose any topic and understand every aspect with tremendous ease. Dinosaurs were his childhood passion and he could identify every skeleton in a museum by the time he was six. While other families traveled to Disneyland, ours visited dinosaur museums. In hopes of absorbing even a small portion of his plethora of information, I stayed at his side on all of his adventures. I looked up at him in awe as he counted the cervical vertebrae of the Apatosaurus and listened intently as he read aloud about the wings of the Archaeopteryx. Together we studied the sediment layers of the Badlands and searched below the KT Boundary for bones. I tagged along, wide-eyed and dreaming of someday becoming as knowledgeable as he was. These experiences ignited my love for science, nature, history, and discovery. As much as I wanted to be like him, this desire was selective. Because of his Asperger\\'s, David had difficulty handling unforeseen circumstances. Many times I was forced to assume control of situations, regardless of my age. Once, on a winter morning many years ago, David and I got into a car accident. The stress was too much for him to handle and he broke down; I was left alone. I took a deep breath, stumbled out of the mangled car, and assumed control of the situation.  As I navigated the protocol for car accidents, David remained cemented to his seat, slamming his palms on the steering wheel and bawling uncontrollably. I will never forget the looks of confusion and sympathy I received that day. Experiences similar to this taught me to accept responsibility and remain composed under stress. These situations were not the only time David\\'s inability to conform to societal norms was exposed. During school, he endured bullying and exclusion for his quirks. It was heartbreaking to witness classmates treat him viciously because he was different. It angered me greatly, and I vowed that I would never be a bystander to intolerance. I learned to speak out against injustice and inequality and to stand up for those who could not. Despite my best efforts, some hateful words always slipped past my defense. As a result, my big sister duties did not end in the hallways. At home, many nights were spent defusing the ticking bomb fueled by his bad day. I let his screaming, malicious comments slide off my shoulders. I reciprocated his hate with love and comfort. Weathering these nights taught me to remain peaceful in the face of anger and hostility. Although he may never realize it, my brother permanently and drastically influenced my life in a variety of ways. He encouraged my love of knowledge, ability to assume control, desire to advocate equality, and strength to stay compassionate. Thanks, big brother. \"}, {\"index\": 760, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Inca-Viking         I closed my eyes, shielding myself from the harsh brightness of the La Paz hospital lights.  The last few hours were a blur.  Sleeping in the back seat, long, dark road, then jolting, dirt, rocks under the tires -- blackness.  A dark ambulance ride, \\'No se duerma!\\' -- don\\'t sleep.  Now, flat on my back in the ER, all I was wondering was how soon I could get back with my group, to finish my marine biology trip in Mexico. I thought I would be up and walking in a few days, but later, doctors, amazed I had even survived, told me that I had been in shock; that\\'s why I didn\\'t immediately feel my fifteen broken bones, punctured lung, and severe whiplash.  At the time, I believed perhaps I had a mild concussion (in fact it was very serious) and a few scrapes (gashes on my legs and face, now scars).  I was flown to Stanford Hospital, where I received further surgery and medical treatment.  Five weeks passed, and I stood up for the first time.  And promptly fainted.         A year later, after re-learning the art of walking, working through countless hours of physical therapy, and gradually increasing classes back on campus instead of at home, I was packing my bags for Italy.  It was time again to go abroad, experience a new culture, and learn a new language.  Despite the severe car accident, the Mexico trip had only whetted my appetite for international immersion.  I figured all of my bad luck for about the next twenty years was used up, and when I was accepted to School Year Abroad (with a substantial scholarship) I couldn\\'t believe my luck. A year spent learning Italian -- and eating gelato -- would be a dream come true.         Fast forward six months: crisp, bracing wind cooled the sweat beading on my face from climbing the 500 steps through the dome topping St. Peter\\'s Basilica.  I stepped out onto the narrow balcony with the three other SYA students brave enough to make the climb, the cacophony of tourists fading as I absorbed the incredible view.  I was on top of the world.  Vatican City unfolded below me, the piazza\\'s key-like form finally visible.  Chilly gusts whipped around my hair, but with my face pressed between the safety bars, I hardly noticed.           Gazing down on Rome was a far cry from lying immobile on a hospital bed. But even during the most painful procedures and the hated blood draws, I knew I would pull through.  As I told the concerned doctors: I am an Inca-Viking.  The blood of the conquerors of South America and the raiders of Northern Europe runs through my veins.         I attribute my love of traveling to my family.  Growing up, at every special occasion, our house was filled with people of many nations and creeds, playing their music and  telling their stories.  As a young child, I somewhat resented my unusual upbringing, at times wishing for all-American parents who would grill burgers instead of cooking Peruvian ceviche or lomo saltado.  My mother\\'s thin Dutch pancakes were so different from their fluffy American sisters, the \\'normal\\' pancakes I would often request.  But while our friends got iPods and TV\\'s, we got trips.  Some of my earliest memories are of being woken at 2 a.m. to catch that red-eye flight to Amsterdam or Lima, or some other destination abroad.  Although we may need to replace the leaky roof and the 15 years old Kia, I have been to the Hagia Sofia and seen a show at the Sydney Opera House.  Ultimately, I feel lucky to have my unique family, an unusual mesh of two distinct cultures.  My parents have shown me that experiences and memories are far more valuable than anything money can buy.  And my heritage will give me all the grit and determination I will ever need. \"}, {\"index\": 761, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  While I was still learning to multiply, my older brother was packing up his belongings for college to begin his adult life. Even worse, Michael stayed at school year-round working, so we couldn\\'t even begin to bond because he was never in town. So, on one lazy July day when I heard Michael\\'s heavy footsteps parade toward my room, I was incredibly surprised. As he inched my bedroom door open, I turned down the volume on my speakers and promptly chirped, \\'Hey, Mikey Mike!\\' \\'How ya doing, Anna Banana?\\' he smiled and offered me a piece of gum. After I accepted, he grabbed a piece for himself and set the container on my bedside table. Following a little bit of nervous small talk, he let out a quick sigh. \\'So how would you feel if I told you I like guys?\\' Originally looking toward the ground, he slowly peered toward me to see my reaction. I let out a short laugh. \\'What? What do you mean?\\' I grinned a little because I didn\\'t know what else to do. He wasn\\'t making any sense. I was expecting a discussion about Michael\\'s rough trip back home, and nothing so monumental. Michael proceeded to tell me that he\\'d known that he was gay for a while, and that when he told the rest of my family everyone embraced it. He expected me to be confused initially. And I was. Out of nervous habit, I grabbed another piece of Trident and chewed away. My brother? Gay? I had nothing against homosexuality, but I only encountered it in a friend, a distant cousin, a teacher. I was even more shocked that as his sister, I hadn\\'t even had an idea. We were siblings, and I should have had some sort of inkling during all the years we lived in the same house. How could I be so aloof to something so important in my own brother\\'s life? I asked why he hadn\\'t told me earlier and if he felt happier after coming out, and I begged him to forgive me if my reaction was not what he wanted it to be. Michael answered all of my questions and gave me a long, warm hug. \\'Love you, little sis.\\' He smiled, hugged me once more, and returned back downstairs, forgetting his cup of gum. Days passed, then weeks, then months. That container of Trident formed a dust ring on my wooden bedside table. I didn\\'t dare take a piece, because it wasn\\'t my gum to chew. However, I never remembered to return it to Michael. Before I could get to it, my brother went back to school gum-free. Later in August, my best friend forgot to bring a toothbrush to a sleepover. Not thinking anything of it, she grabbed a piece of gum to prevent having food stuck in her teeth. I popped my head out of the bathroom to say something and caught her red-handed. I was livid. I ripped the container out of her hand and slammed it back onto its dust ring. That was not her gum, she didn\\'t even ask, and I could\\'ve easily found an extra toothbrush. And why was she looking at me like I had gone insane?I was being ridiculous. But that package was more than gum \\\\u2013 it represented the first time I had a heart-to-heart with Michael. I had finally seen a previously-secret side of him and she was eating my proof of it..            Soon after this embarrassing event, I came home to an empty bedside table. Admittedly, that small missing item made me feel a small sense of grief until I realized why it was initially there. I still had the memory of Michael opening up to me. The gum did not have to be a souvenir of my brother and our conversation, but rather a landmark of a closer sibling relationship, one that I yearned for as the last kid left over back at home. Hopefully there would be many more moments where we would open up to each other and get to know one another more sufficiently after my grade-school years. I could still look forward to spending time with him with a newfound trust, and there was no need to prove our bond with a few mint candies. \"}, {\"index\": 762, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  We didn\\'t call our car the \\'Pile of Junk\\' for nothing. That was just the most logical title for a vehicle that broke down so often that my dad recognized the men who operated the tow trucks. The name made sense given the pervasive odor of French fries that followed the car wherever it went, the swim gear and tools cluttering the backseat, and the shuddering sound that betrayed its approach from a mile away.  The POJ was a 1982 Mercedes with an angular, white body, rust-colored seats and shiny hubcaps. (At least, they started out shiny.) We acquired it through a spontaneous eBay bid, and my dad and I flew to D.C. to pick it up amidst cries of \\'You were serious about that?!\\' from well-meaning relatives. When we triumphantly drove into Boston, Dad converted it to run on vegetable oil, befriending some local restaurateurs who gladly gave him their excess.  I was dubbed \\'Director of Procurement\\' on these canola-collecting pilgrimages. But this seemingly official moniker did nothing to stop my complaining. Painstakingly filtering the oil through a sock system in the back of Dad\\'s office and hosing out the containers afterwards felt like a punishment, and I was having none of it. I would rather sit inside and read Harry Potter. But the POJ worked its magic on me. As a girl who didn\\'t learn to ride a bike until age eleven, I wasn\\'t exactly fond of risks (unless they were being taken by other people in books). Somehow, the POJ changed all that. Our adventures were endless. My family and I took it to Cape Cod, where we drove too fast over a dirt road and burst a pipe, causing green coolant liquid to seep out as we frantically poured jugs of water into the radiator to keep the car from overheating. We took it to the beach, where we filled the back seat with plastic bottles and cans to be recycled. We took it to drive-in movies, baseball games, and the Adirondacks.  But the POJ lived up to its name. Every time we went up a hill I crossed my fingers, because sometimes it just didn\\'t come down. On Easter Sunday, on the way to my brother\\'s hockey games and just when I least expected it, the car would buck and halt. Part of me usually wanted to scream, but another part secretly relished the way the POJ\\'s twists kept us on our toes. I didn\\'t have long to mourn when one last break-down finally did the car in. Soon, we got another veggie car, and promptly christened it \\'POJ2.\\' POJ2 was a 2002 Volkswagen Jetta. Much remained the same with this \\'new\\' car: Dad would still screech to a stop in the middle of crowded intersections so that one of us could leap out and grab a stray bottle before the light turned red. It still had kayaks on the roof, swim gear in the trunk, and God-knows-what under the seats. It still afforded us with some wild memories. I found it fitting that when it finally drove its last, POJ2 went out with a bang (literally), crashing into the fence behind our house, almost hurtling down a cliff, and sending Dad to the emergency room in the process.  I thought I would relish this opportunity to get rid of the vehicle that had plagued us with years of repair bills and parking tickets; instead, I felt I had lost a friend. I would never be able to pull up to college in a car that shuddered and smelled of French fries, like Dad had promised. I wouldn\\'t be late to school because the \\'car wouldn\\'t start,\\' and my sister wouldn\\'t point out mysterious residues on my pants from sitting in something sticky. In the end, I didn\\'t get either POJ. But I got something even better: my sense of adventure. \"}, {\"index\": 763, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Mentors have had a powerful influence over me ever since I was young. My granddad acted as my first mentor, exposing me to a world of ham radios, trinkets, Rubik\\'s Cubes and creativity. Little did I know that when he died, I had lost the best mentor I would ever have. My grandfather\\'s creative projects instilled me with a desire to learn by utilizing learning opportunities and what others taught me to design and create my own learning projects.My expertise with designing was limited at first, but my knowledge with carnivorous plants introduced me to the world of designing plant hybrids. A local orchid grower had taught me how to grow Venus flytraps, and later taught me how to hybridize these exotic species. I decided that I should try and create my own carnivorous plant hybrid, which was much harder than I had anticipated. Over a period of five years, I struggled to create a hybrid that was a superb design between two plant varieties. The first spring, a rabbit ate the flower stalk. After all measures had been made to protect against rabbits, a bug ate the flower stalk the following spring. At first I feared the unknown, not knowing what challenge or failure I\\'d encounter next.  But soon the unknown began to excite me. Each failure taught me something new and opened up an unexplored opportunity to try again. My success with creating the hybrid inspired me to create even more hybrids with people around the world. I exchanged pollen with a grower in Colorado, and together we created one of the first hybrids with Nepenthes Rajah, a carnivorous plant capable of consuming rats. Five years of learning had paid off and opened a world full of opportunities.I had learned a lot about carnivorous plants, yet I still desired to learn more about engineering. An engineer was visiting my local town to test out his new drone design. \\'Let\\'s face it, the first time you fly one of these things, you\\'ll crash,\\' the engineer told me as he showed me the various components of his drone. I knew from my experiences with carnivorous plants that he was right. Only a few months later, I had designed and built a larger version of the engineer\\'s drone. I would often find myself with the drone in one hand and the controller in the other, knowing that the drone would inevitably crash but that I\\'d have to learn somehow. Over time, I experienced less crashes and stabler flights. Maneuvering the wind currents became easy, and unexpected thermal vents no longer frightened me \\\\u2013 they actually made drone-flying fun. My new knowledge with designing and flying drones had me asking myself, \\'How could I design a drone that could benefit the world and save lives?\\' With this in mind, I decided to build a drone that would film and chase wild fires. The engines would need to rotate so that the drone could catch up to a part of the forest fire and slow down to a hover to capture aerial footage of the flames. Various mentors on the school\\'s FIRST Robotics Team taught me how to design objects on a computer, create gearboxes, and make objects with a 3D Printer. With the knowledge I had learned, I set out to design a 3D printed gearbox system that would rotate the engines. I finished the new drone design, and took it out into the field to test it. As I turned the drone on, the engines activated and the plane began to hover. I didn\\'t hesitate when I grabbed the controller. All of my designing experiences had taught me that knowledge is a gift that comes in the form of mentors, lessons, and opportunities. This time, a new opportunity is hovering right in front of me, waiting to pursue new and unexplored boundaries. I am ready to take the controls. \"}, {\"index\": 764, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  I didn\\'t see many rainbows in India. They hide in the monsoon rains, or are too frightened by the hot, stifling climate. Likewise, I was terrified of showing that side of myself in a homophobic country, especially to the host family I had grown to love. \\'Why India?\\', my friends would ask. They knew the cruel, anti-gay laws in that country. I knew I had to go anyway. I felt an obligation to see what life must be like when society ignores you, constricts you like a tightly-wound sari. And subconsciously, I hoped that I might somehow change opinions. Yet when I arrived, I was scared to broach the subject, even with Aditya, my 13-year old, smart, but immature, host brother. Only a pink, flimsy curtain separated our shared bedroom from the corridor, but nevertheless a sort of secret camaraderie developed during our nightly hushed conversation. We hoped Aji and Baba wouldn\\'t hear us. As Aditya asked me which of the girls on my program I liked, I remembered the sleepovers of my childhood, during which the discussion of romance was dreaded and confusing. Now, I countered with ease. \\'Sophia is pretty\\', I diplomatically replied, releasing the moment\\'s tension that only I perceived. I began to enjoy responding to his provocative questions, the answers to which he already knew, teaching him what were accepted topics of discussion within my culture. \\'What is dating?\\' \\'How are babies made?\\' I reveled in his squirming and shock when I gave a blunt, sex-ed-type answer. \\'Have you ever liked a girl?\\' Personal pronouns had never before been so treacherous, nor so masterfully avoided. I found myself relishing the satisfaction of self-knowledge, the thrill of carrying a secret, the transition from a very private introvert to now a big brother for the second time in my life-candid about everything-except for one. \\'He\\'s the biggest homosexual in my class\\', he snorted, while discussing his classmates. I seized up, but I willed myself to speak, venturing into unsafe airspace. \\'Aditya, you shouldn\\'t make fun of gay people.\\' I sounded like a cheesy tolerance advertisement. \\'Did you know that they\\' (the safety of third-person!) \\'don\\'t choose to be gay?\\' He disagreed. We continued bantering in the first truly meaningful debate of my life, though the culture clash was played with blunted weapons. The notion of me having gay friends astounded him. The thought of telling him the truth, which for my own safety I couldn\\'t do, was appealing. Instead, I took a different risk as I exposed myself to the likelihood of disappointment. \\'Did you know that in some parts of America, two men or two women can get married?\\' He did. \\'What do you think about that?\\' I expected him to disapprove and prepared to brush off the ignorance. His experience was far different than my own. I remembered how lucky I was to live in colorful Massachusetts.After a long pause, he replied. \\'I think it\\'s good. As long as a gay person doesn\\'t have to marry a non-gay person.\\' I remember being overwhelmed by the hope that must have spilled from our humid apartment into the street below. I believed then, as now, that I had done a tiny part in the global quest for justice, and I was proud. Or perhaps progress was to come without my actions. Yet the unexpectedness of his affirmation, coupled with the innocent humor of its qualification, made me smile as the night\\'s tropical rains descended on India. We would find out the morning\\'s weather soon enough. \"}, {\"index\": 765, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'Oh wow, I didn\\'t know I was this flexible,\\' I thought to myself as I had the nape of my neck cranked towards the back of my heels. Even after physically demanding practices and minimal caloric intake, I found myself contorted into yet another uncomfortable knot. This pattern ensued throughout a majority of my first matches, and I vividly remember questioning my motives for starting wrestling.Before wrestling, I identified myself as a left-brained thinker, always employing logic to make decisions. My education centered around math and science, subjects fundamentally based on rigid, quantitative reasoning. So, with my nonexistent athletic credentials as a member of the fourths soccer team and a coxswain (skillful boat sitter), and my unwavering allegiance to Lays and Coke, wrestling made no sense. It didn\\'t help that I had weekly commitments to prance around for an audience, clothed in a rubber band, which my coaches deceptively called a \\'unitard.\\' Though proceeding with wrestling seemed irrational, I didn\\'t ground my decision to continue in logic. Just like the paradoxical complexity of a person\\'s belief in both religion and science, I loved and hated wrestling. While I loathed Mr. Teutsch\\'s unrelenting army workouts, the considerable focus and inventiveness that wrestling required kept me dedicated. Oddly enough, these rollercoaster of emotions stirred in me a growing peculiar affection for wrestling. And after I accepted our tumultuous relationship, I gained some valuable insights. Unlike the predictability of math and science, every wrestling match had its own distinct personality. Some opponents had deliberate, but slow movements, while others had quick, but often rash ones. The quirks of each wrestler forced me to quickly analyze situations and tackle problems with innovative solutions. To trump the slow wrestler, I changed the game\\'s pace to disorient him. For the fast one, I watched his rapid footwork until he faltered. For the match where I had thirty seconds left, but no stamina, I gave myself a bloody nose to get injury time to catch my breath. This problem solving was coupled with intense physical duress, an unfamiliar experience. The grit and silent resilience of wrestlers taught me to persevere, on and off the mat. I got a glimpse of the vigorous training competitive sports required and simultaneously learned to think on my feet, valuable lessons on athleticism and flexibility that I had missed due to constraints from my once exclusively logical, academic background. Although there were times I thought that I was a masochist, wrestling ultimately expanded my systematic mode of thinking. I approached difficulties at unique angles, whether the obstacle was a talented opponent or a tough calculus problem. Admittedly, learning these important insights may have cost me quite a few brain cells from all the painful knots I ended up in. But nevertheless, my adventures in my unitard altered my mechanical thought process to become more flexible, just like a rubber band. \"}, {\"index\": 766, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 767, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 768, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Joyous Christmas music fills the air, and a plate of hot samosas and spring rolls are passed around. The rules of Dreidel are explained to still-confused opponents, and Secret Santa gifts are pushed carefully into a corner. A friend turns down \\'Mistletoe Jam\\' and everyone gathers around an ornate silver menorah to witness the lighting of the eighth candle. I look around and see dark faces, pale faces, tinted and blended faces\\\\u2014all with the same look of confused appreciation as they watch the flames dance from one candle to the other and attempt to keep up with Hebrew prayer songs. In this moment of sweet disarray, I cannot help but smile. A yearly tradition that has been maintained since my freshman year, our annual holiday celebration calls for the exchanging of Christmas gifts, the lighting of the menorah, and the contribution and consumption of numerous cultural dishes. Empanadas sit next to wontons sit next to baked mac and cheese, and hit Christmas tunes are shamelessly belted out during karaoke. A group of close friends as colorful and varied as ornaments upon the tree gather to embrace every unique culture and background. Merry as it sounds, people have condemned our annual holiday party. Some have even called it sacrilegious. The cultures clash, the ideologies differ, and the spicy biryani does not complement the peppermint fudge. While my friends are happy to write it off as \\'just for fun,\\' I hold our holiday celebration sacred in its own right. I am content to find myself in the center of such complete cultural harmony, where many varied cultures do not simply exist, but complement each other. In this sweet environment of racial, religious, and ethnic accord, it is our differences that make for such a remarkably glorious occasion. Nine countries, five religions, and three holidays are shared among us. Our holiday party is a celebration of diversity. There is beauty to be found all around us in this world; however, I believe there to be no greater beauty than that of tolerance, which must live alongside diversity. Tolerance is quiet; it does not demand to be noticed, but it visibly illuminates the place in which it exists. It understands without antagonism, appreciates without challenge, and earnestly preserves without contention. If the olive branch symbolizes peace, tolerance is the trunk\\\\u2014it is wholly essential to social harmony and growth. Our holiday party is a microcosm exemplifying an ideal world where many unique cultures can live side by side in amity. In this age of globalization, tolerance is certainly the most essential practice. By accepting those differences that distinguish us from one another, we open ourselves to the stories, critical viewpoints, and experiences that expand our own perspectives and enrich our lives. Unfortunately, gazing upon the turbulent world, it is apparent that we still have a long way to go before complete tolerance is achieved. Today, Palestinians and Israelis still fight a bloody territorial war, Russia fails to recognize LGBT rights, and racial tensions between whites and minorities are again alarmingly high in the U.S. When Muslim radicals promote destruction 6,000 miles away from where I live, I am called a terrorist.But, when I am brought back to my wonderful holiday party, and I watch a menorah being lit, and smell the muddled aroma of distinct dishes, and hear joyous cheers from friends as someone unwraps an eccentric gay pride T-shirt, I am reminded that there is hope. There are homes where tolerance is celebrated, institutions that are colored with rich diversity, and people who offer but love and acceptance to those who are different. These are the people who have the power to move minds and drive away the murky overcast of intolerance. This is the environment I am most proud to be a part of, and throughout my life, I intend to effectively contribute to its dispersion. \"}, {\"index\": 769, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Some students have a background or story that is so central to their identity that they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story. (prompt)By the end of my sophomore year, I had my entire life figured out down to the smallest possible detail. I knew I wanted to attend Berkeley, become the best psychologist in the world, and to join the Peace Corps when I graduated college. It was set. I was determined. I was ready. So why am I on the Common Application? When senior year came, it took me less than a month to completely change my entire life plans.      On September 11, 2014 I received an email inviting me to a presentation for Smith College that would, in an essence, change my life. I was not planning on attending the presentation because for one, it was an all-girls college, and two, it was across the country- literally. From California to Massachusetts? There is no possible chance I was to go to school there. Thank goodness for my optimism; I decided to give it a chance and to attend, along with my Women of Distinction Application summited. I left that presentation with a new impression, a new sense of empowerment, and a new friend. It turned out that my new friend was the Director of the Women of Distinction Program; I guess I set an impression because I got in and, for the first time in my life, I got on a plane, to Massachusetts. It was everything I only dreamed a college would have. So there I was, laying down after my first day in Massachusetts, completely throwing years of planning away because I had made up my mind for Early Decision to Smith. One hour of my life at that presentation, that I considered not to attend, and a weekend at Smith has brought me to this very moment in which I am applying to the only college I truly wish to attend.     Sure, I could have discussed how hard my life has been living in a low-income community or how many opportunities I miss out on because of it but in reality, it wouldn\\'t explain the person I am. I could have discussed all of my amazing accomplishments, but then, it would feel obnoxious and superficial. Actually, accomplishments happen every day and no matter how big or small they are, they should all be important so it would be hard to pick only one. \\'An essay is the only time you have throughout your application to really show your personality.\\' It\\'s pretty hard to really show your true personality through an application. Everything on my resume is true, Captain of the Soccer Team, Academic Decathlon double medalist, but what you can\\'t see is the time commitments and struggles that I overcame with a big smile on my face while doing it. That is exactly why I decided to do an interview while I was at Smith. So after looking through the five essay prompts and after exhausting every possibility for an essay, I thought, what better story to tell than the one where I almost never discovered Smith. The school that completely opposes everything that I had set my mind to for years and the school that saved me from making the biggest mistake of my life. \"}, {\"index\": 770, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The inside of our car is my second classroom; but instead of exploring the crisis of the debt ceiling or practicing the subtleties of trig substitution, I learn about life, positive thinking, and purpose. Sitting in Los Angeles traffic, I listened to the self-help books that my mother couldn&#39;t read, but loved to listen to.We listened until we finished The Power for the third time in a row. Then, if we spontaneously started using the narrator&#39;s accent, we agreed to go back to singing along to the Taylor Swift songs that my nine-year-old sister begged to listen to from the back seat. These self-help book listening sessions were a therapy and refuge for both my mother and me: my mother to help heal the pain of her past, and me to learn how to tackle the world with passion and drive.When I was young, my mother would feed my reading addiction by letting me raid libraries and buy as many used books as I could get my small hands on. Books have always been a part of my life, letting me jump into new worlds. The audio books started back in 2005, and changed the reality of my own. When I was in third grade, my family opened a restaurant, something that my mother always dreamed of doing. We were placing all of our hopes on a new foundation, and we needed all of the strength that we could muster. Lacking time, my mother turned to audio books, taking the time to listen every time we were in the car. Our first book was The Secret. Every day, my mother would pop in whichever disk we were on into the CD player of the car. As an 8-year-old, it changed the way I thought about circumstances, allowing me to look forward rather than backwards, knowing that everything happens for a reason to bring you to better horizons. I was taught to try to understand everyone and everything through Byrne&#39;s omniscient voice echoing through the confines of the car.Our restaurant made its grand opening floating on the backs of our positive thoughts. Then came book number two, A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose by Eckhart Tolle. My parents work from 9am to midnight, and I also help them whenever needed. During down times I sat in the corner, did my schoolwork, read, and looked after my little sister, who I&#39;ve been taking care of since she was born. Introduced by Oprah, my mother&#39;s inspiration, we listened to Tolle about working with and listening to others, the importance of our actions, and the need to recognize which behaviors work against us. I learned how to listen, to talk, to interact, watching my parents with the customers and through the words of Tolle. These skills proved essential as I grew and took on leadership roles, allowing me to work with vastly different types of people, from youth making a difference through the American Cancer Society, to adults contributing to their community through the Porter Ranch Neighborhood Council.These books have shaped the tenor of my personality and the color of my world as much as my parents have. One day, I&#39;ll read my own words in the hopes of helping others like I have been helped. Hope, my future audio book, like my favorite book, The Last Lecture by Pausch and Zaslow, will be the accumulation of the life lessons that I&#39;ve gained throughout my life. It will explore finding your passions and being unafraid to delve in, gaining a foothold in the practice of positive thinking and proactivity. The balance in my life came through the lessons I learned from the floating voices in the confines of my car. The car is where I can bring myself back into my life&#39;s mantra, revive its strength, and continue it outside of its borders. \"}, {\"index\": 771, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I share a laboratory with an old Volvo station wagon, discarded lumber, and a family of daddy longlegs.  My garage is a home within a home. Two pale fluorescent tube lights hum and glow, illuminating layers of plastic shavings and steel dust coating the floor and countertops.  Thumbtacks pin penciled drafts and diagrams of boats, cars, and cannons to the unfinished walls. Their physical counterparts lay hidden away in stained cardboard boxes stacked high to the ceiling. I spend hours here, breaking the calm with the sawing of polycarbonate and grinding of power tools. The combination of calculation, experimentation, and play that happens in my garage has instilled in me a love for engineering. I aspire to one day expand my horizons beyond this humble space and build the world in which I live.Primed from youth, I had a fascination with the way things functioned. My mom started me off with the traditional boyhood regiment of LEGOs. The constant clatter of plastic from my resolute searches through the toy bin would drive her insane most nights, yet on every holiday and birthday I\\'d find a box of LEGOs with her name on the card. This passion for plastic became increasingly punctuated by other explorations. My world was full of black boxes \\\\u2013 machines with inputs and outputs but no apparent indication of their internals. I ventured out with screwdriver in hand to reveal the inner workings underneath their shells. Jars filled with screws while carcasses of gadgets ranging from clocks to remote-control monster trucks littered the shelves as my curiosity for the mechanical grew.This early path of destruction developed into more constructive aspirations. I moved on from the living room to the garage when interlocking bricks no longer fit my needs. It took trial and error to figure out the finer points of the tools inherited from my dad. Only scars remain from the cut fingers and the scraped palms. His rotary tool and drill, scuffed and worn with time, are my most prized possessions. The rows of yogurt cups packed with metal hardware and the bags of PVC pipe fittings, remnants of his past projects, now serve as the materials for my own work. This confined space of infinite possibilities is where I have the freedom to discover and build. Nothing satisfies me more than translating moments of enlightenment into actual products. Creating my own black boxes has introduced me to worlds with incredible potential. These past years, I\\'ve devoted my time towards engineering cannons. The projectiles range from potatoes to foam Nerf darts that are launched by springs and air pressure. Loading mechanisms require knowledge of levers, frictional forces, and rotational motion. Constructing the internals is like solving a puzzle in which the pieces have to be fabricated beforehand. Some components are modeled with computer-aided design programs and manufactured using 3D printing while others are wrought from physical effort. Testing phases involve meticulous measurements and the application of physics equations. Acting as both the driver and beneficiary of my academic pursuits, the interests that I\\'ve pursued here have deepened my enthusiasm for technological research and development.Each experience and project contributed to how I develop and realize my ideas. My desire to become a mechanical engineer is reflected on the walls and in the boxes of my garage. The broad scope of these endeavors exposed me to scientific and mathematical concepts that I intend on studying further. A loving family and adequate space provided the foundation to explore my passions. This unassuming place and its machines have defined my future. I aim to understand the unknown and build it back even greater than before. My dream is to create innovations that drive human progress in order to give back to the world that set me up for so much. No longer can a cardboard case or a few hundred square feet contain these designs. \"}, {\"index\": 772, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'Don\\'t ever complain about your food again; you are dishonoring God\\'s creation,\\' my mom authoritatively states, refuting any objection I make towards a meal she has prepared. \\'Don\\'t forget to eat a spoonful of sugar before you leave for the airport so that God protects you through your journey.\\' If my mom is accompanying me on the airplane, and God forbid that we encounter turbulence, I can always expect to hear her chanting the Hindu mantra, \\'Om Namah Shivaya,\\' as she pleads to the Almighty Lord Shiva to calm the furious clouds. It is safe to say that my mother\\'s unconventional actions and suggestions often leave me shaking my head. Prior to experiencing the emotional and rebellious rollercoaster of my adolescence, my schema of reality was dominated by my mom\\'s Hindu beliefs. It was as though my mom had unveiled her chosen route on the tracks of life, and I was just a train that passively rode along the exact same path. I followed my mom to her favorite temple every Sunday and imitated the rituals she performed. I sketched a Hindu symbol at the top-right margin of every school examination in the hope that it would lead me to an excellent score. In times of struggle, I instinctively chanted the sacred Gayatri Mantra that she had taught me to ease my stress. I trusted everything she believed; I was gradually becoming a replica of my mother.Before I knew it, what once was a steady train ride became exposed to the forces of skepticism, and thus transformed into the likes of a rollercoaster. I developed a fascination for science, especially its unparalleled ability to explain so many of the ambiguities of our world. After recognizing that I had sheltered myself from such tremendous breadth of knowledge, I began to doubt my conception of the truth. Instead of continuing my commitment to the Hindu Vedas and their belief that Lord Brahma was the deity responsible for the creation of the universe, I started to believe, as the Big Bang suggests, that the creation of the universe was caused by a cataclysmic explosion of a miniscule volume of matter at a high temperature and density.  I acquainted myself with a new pair of scientific lenses that gave me a logical basis for perceiving the world, enabling me to dismiss my former adherence to irrational claims. The act of challenging my identity, however, is not an abandonment of my religion. My reformed perspective of life has instead enhanced my certainty in the existence of God. How else can one explain the flawless nature of the physical world and the impeccable fashion with which life flourishes on Earth, aside from accepting that there is a force greater than Science that is enabling such perfection? Religions unite societies and yield hope in times of adversity like no scientific theory is capable of.  My transformation did result in the dismissal of several Hindu beliefs; but, the evolution of my identity was not a denunciation of my religion. Instead, it was an endeavor to construct an identity that was an amalgamation of the religious and scientific beliefs I choose to hold, and not a derivative of my mother\\'s or anyone else\\'s. My decision to challenge my core principles has ultimately encouraged me to habitually question my views, allowing me to welcome change and unceasingly improve as an individual. I feel no repentance as a result of my decision, particularly because this journey has strengthened my relationship with my mom. Although our contrasting perspectives initially induced mild tension between us, we have both learned to take pleasure in discussing our discordant views, and have consequently become more open and trusting of each other. Our relationship serves as a constant reminder that both religious and scientific ideals can indeed harmoniously coexist in shaping my identity and refining my understanding of the world.  \"}, {\"index\": 773, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 774, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'Give us today our daily bread.\\'Such words I would hear both at Sunday congregations and from occasional bread-lovers that show up at our family bakery. Propelled by the entrepreneurial mentality of my family, I started to develop a growing desire for success at a young age. However, this seemingly ambitious desire gradually transformed into a self-centered way of life as I began to yearn for a sumptuous lifestyle that ignored the welfare of others.Despite my increasing appetite for luxury, I was taught to be both selfless and magnanimous as part of my upbringing. In my freshmen year, when my grandfather suffered a stroke which cost him his ability to speak, I rediscovered the virtues that were so deeply instilled within me. I visited him each day after school where we sat in a silence that made me wonder if he noticed my presence at all. When one day out of the blue he caressed my face, I glimpsed what it felt like to have a heart devoted to someone other than myself. Still, I lived a life of paradox without conflicts; I was a filial grandson after school and dwelled on the lavishness of my future the very same night.For years I failed to recognize the growing contradictions in the values I held onto. It was not until I travelled to Hita, Japan where I encountered a cormorant fisherman that I began to grasp my situation. I held my breath as the cormorant disgorged its most recent catch into the pail on the fisherman\\'s boat. Though fascinated by this ancient practice of the Japanese, my curiosity soon turned into repulsion. The anguished whimpers of the bird, ignored by the fisherman, sounded unnervingly like cries for help, leaving me stranded to observe the process helplessly from above. Surely, I reasoned, there are more humane ways of catching dinner than denying the bird the pleasure of swallowing its catch.Equally, however, I was aware that I was watching a cultural tradition that I had only glimpsed for an hour at best. How was I qualified to pass judgment on something that dates back over one thousand years? I smiled politely to the fisherman, careful not to reveal my inner turmoil. But I could not hide from this same dilemma in my own mind. The more I reflected on what I experienced in Japan, the more I began to discern vestiges of a similar conflict that existed within me. Was I, just like the fishermen, over-looking a deeper rift in my own life?Previously intimidated to look past the fa\\\\u00e7ade that I so comfortably resided in, I now had the courage to confront the different unanswered enigmas that I once deemed trivial. I realized that I have long held the answer; serving others is not one-dimensional and limited to bequeathing the monetary wealth that I had once desired. It is through spending time, not money, that I have learned how to make an impact. Now a frequent visitor to local orphanages, I am learning to put my beliefs into practice by serving with a genuine heart. Slowly, too, I have developed a separate family in the orphanage that views me not as an outsider but embraces me into its community.Henry Miller said, \\'One\\'s destination is never a place, but a new way of seeing things.\\' Growing up on the borders of American and Taiwanese cultures, it still surprises me that it took a family trip to Japan to make me realize something so obvious and fundamental in my own life. I never once questioned the co-existence of this particular conflict because I conveniently picked two different ways of life. I am still learning how to balance fortune and altruism, but glimpsing the grey areas has awakened my conscience to what I had long ignored. And that is teaching me to look at myself with a new pair of eyes. \"}, {\"index\": 775, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 776, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 777, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Shortly after my diagnosis with Type 1 Diabetes, I concluded that I was going to find the cure. In college, I would learn about the latest scientific discoveries and newest biomedical devices. My years after college would be spent in high tech laboratories where discovery and breakthrough were part of daily life. I would become famous for my ingenuity.I was seven years old at the time.My ten year \\'Diabetes Anniversary\\' is in less than a month, but my broken pancreas has taught more about both life and myself than any family member, book, or school lecture ever could.Firstly, I have come to realize that life does not always fall into place with such graceful transitions. Life is anything but predictable, and no matter how well we micromanage, there are several outside factors that are simply out of our control. Diabetes was an uninvited inconvenience which granted itself permanent residency in my life. Who would have thought that my life would come to depend on a pharmaceutical drug massed produced by microscopic e. coli? Having a chronic disease entails a future of doctor\\'s appointments, medicine, and complications. By the age of ten, I could measure my blood sugar levels, draw and inject a syringe, and use and program an insulin pump. My carbohydrate counting skills were as good as my dietician\\'s, and I knew all the symptoms and consequences of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and ketoacidosis. An extensive skill set I never wanted had become the necessity for my health.Additionally, like any other battle, there is a mental vitality that must be clung to and never let go. It is so easy to forget that each and every one of us has inner battles, unseen by even our closest loved ones. My peers see the finger pricking, the insulin pump, and my seemingly obsessive possession of juice boxes. They do not witness the doctor\\'s appointments I have departed in tears, or experience the late nights spent treating hypoglycemia, or feel the sting that sears through me every time one jokingly shares an ignorant stereotype. Each situation becomes a learning experience in which I struggle to separate important life lessons from the unpleasantries which will inevitably accompany. Still, our ability to endure and persevere is something I have come to admire and appreciate about our mental strength.I sometimes wonder about what my life would be without Diabetes. It has become so permanently integrated into my life that more often than not, I find myself simply going through the motions. But when I take the time to stop and take a hard look at things, I know that I would not be the same person I am today without Diabetes. My favorite school subjects, health, biology, and physics, would lack any personal importance to me. School would be a bore, and I probably wouldn\\'t hold much excitement for college. I\\'ve always had a special interest in the many functions of the human body, the current research of the scientific community, and the newest treatments for the diseases which plague this earth. Diabetes has driven me to learn and improve. But learning extends far beyond the classroom. I have been to a lot of doctor\\'s appointments. And diabetes camps. And conventions. Even though they seem like a monotonous nuisance, I have met some of the most influential, compassionate, and intelligent people through these events. These people remind me that kindness and understanding are greater than the newest tech gadget. They have taught me that a physical illness in no way defines your character or intelligence. They have taught me that obstacles can\\'t stop me.Most importantly, I have realized that life is too valuable to not make a difference. \"}, {\"index\": 778, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I still remember the time when I was participating in the IMO 2012.When the contest got started, I was given a yellow paper, on which 3 problems werewritten.After about an hour the contest started, I easily stroke the first problem. But for next 3hours, I couldn\\'t solve any more. As the remaining time was nearly finished, I startedto panic. To relax a bit, I closed my eyes and tried to concentrate. Suddenly Iremembered my father\\'s gentle voice and the beautiful countryside where we used tospend every summer. My father once told me that the snow-top mountain that couldbe seen in the distance has always protected our family. We Mongolians come from ashamanistic culture so worship and respect of nature is common within our society. Iimagined the mountain; it was as if I were there in person. Suddenly I felt re-energizedand attempted to solve the problems with new vigor. As I attacked the problems, thesolutions came easily and I had the problem solved within minutes. With time runningout, I kept attacking the problems and was able to solve all the problems just as thelast moments were passing by.The results came in, and I had gotten a bronze medal!

I cannot explain this feeling, even with the scientific method. There is no hypothesis to state, no procedure to carry out, and no observation to record. All that I feel is serenity, peace, and harmony during my church\\'s adorations on the first Friday of every month. During church adoration, my dichotomy of science and religion have a power struggle. On one side, there is a scientist, and on the other side there is a priest. The scientist constantly attacks the monk with theories and laws to disprove many of the things the priest claims like the existence of a god and an afterlife. While the scientist attacks with logic, the priest defends with his faith. However, in this situation, the scientist is confounded. He cannot explain to the priest what is happening to me because he himself does not understand everything. He cannot explain why I feel something moving through my body because there is no physical thing to run tests with. The scientist gives up, giving all the power to the priest. With the priest in control, he takes me and the scientist on a joyride through the gates of heaven. There we relax on the cumulus clouds while drinking egg nog because there are no stresses we have to face here like standardized tests and familial issues. While in heaven, the scientist actually starts to understand the priest and they crack jokes and laugh rather than argue. We stay there for a bit until the priest takes us back home to the real world. After Father Mason removes Jesus from his pedestal and closes the session, things are not the same. I do not feel the same peace that I felt during adoration, but I do feel a calmness between my scientific self and my religious self. As I walk through the church doors and look out to the busy corner of Rockaway Avenue and Eastern Parkway, I can feel the scientist and priest shaking hands rather than screaming at each other like they usually do. However, there is always a disturbance of the alliance made between them and I always find myself coming back to repair it every month.  \"}, {\"index\": 780, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\\\u0394SFor the first 15 years of my life I had little to no direction. When asked what I loved, or what I wanted to be when I was older, I would either stutter searching for an answer, or confess to what currently held my attention. I\\'ve had fits of different momentary obsessions, at various times believing that some singular thing was definitely what I loved more than anything. When I was five it was ballet- I stayed in the class for about a month. One month every year between first grade and sixth it was becoming an author. Nursing was my forte for about five months in seventh grade. Once I  had to apply to high school, it became drawing- mostly because I had to apply somewhere, and the art school I currently attend was close by. At the beginning of Sophomore year, it was Filmmaking. All of these ephemeral obsessions emerged from thin air, climaxed suddenly, and then promptly vanished. I point out my small attention span only to make it completely clear how much eventually finding my passion means to me.Sophomore year, 2012, late November, sitting in the middle of my chemistry class, it hits me like a swift kick to the ribs. We had been discussing how chemical reactions can only take place if the conditions are spontaneous enough; how there has to be a certain level of disorder to create anything, how the atoms of the universe had to be just the right bit unorderly to trigger the massive explosion that created the substance of our lives. It was in that moment that I realized this is what I want to spend the rest of my life doing. Our universe is predisposed to disorder, only functions through spontaneity. Here was a subject that told me- \\'It\\'s okay. You have been chaotic in what you want. The world is chaotic.\\' Not only this, but the subject, the science of chemistry was utterly captivating. It involved all the things I loved about math- numbers, equations, a system on how to do things- with what I loved about life- uncertainty, creation, open-endedness (Heisenberg Principle, anyone?). It was not a decision to love chemistry, nor a sudden lack of indecisiveness. It was an illuminating realization that I was drawn to chaos, and that chaos would always be apart of my life. Chemistry gave me the freedom to embrace that aspect of who I was, and finally settle on something.Seeing what chemistry revealed about the world pushed me so strongly towards appreciating spontaneity and disorder that I did something entirely out of the norm for me- I risked my fear of rejection. In April of my Junior year, I applied to five-week science program called the Pennsylvania Governor\\'s School for the Sciences (PGSS). Although entirely convinced that I didn\\'t stand a chance of being accepted, especially when there were 500 other people applying for one of the 60 empty spots, I let my spontaneous nature push me forward rather than push me down. At that point, the possibility of being told I wasn\\'t good enough was dwarfed by the sheer hunger for just a taste of what my future could be. So deeply invested into chemistry had I become, that I let spontaneity become a good thing, rather than what held me back.In the end, I got in. Discovering what I would devote the rest of my life to drove me to push myself to do things I wouldn\\'t have done before.  This is not to say that I am perfect now, nor am I looking to be. I have purpose though, more confidence, and I\\'m working towards becoming the person I hope to be. Finding something I love, something I know I will stick with, something that encourages me to embrace everything that is chaotic about the world and myself, is helping me to do just that. \"}, {\"index\": 781, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 782, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Ink-Stained Fingers My fingers are always ink-stained. I love ink, pens, words, and the act of writing. I have been enamored with typography ever since I could reach my desk while standing on a chair. It began with my family. We would make signs for everything\\\\u2014to greet someone after a long trip or welcome family to breakfast on Valentine\\'s Day. After signs came graffiti, never the illegal kind, but the wild, beautiful, abstract kind. Graffiti purposefully ignores boundaries. I loved that\\\\u2014needed that\\\\u2014in my early teens; it helped unleash my curiosity by enabling me to break rules with a purpose.Over time, my medium changed, though my love of typography (the art of letters and printed matter) remained constant. Calligraphy, a precise, ordered, simple, and elegant art form, captivated me next. It meets a different need: my need for solitude, quiet, and introspection. Calligraphy\\'s contrasting elements, deep black ink against crisp white paper, bring clarity and poise. My love of letters flourished through calligraphy then escaped from the page, spilling into the virtual environment of digital typography and design. Each of these forms conveys a different emotion, like a song; the lyrics are important, but the way they are expressed holds the true power.        My desk, with ink spots blooming across its scuffed surface, is where I indulge in the pleasures of typography. It is cluttered\\\\u2014a ruler, pencils, a basket overflowing with pens and ink, a blank sheet of paper and a precarious stack of books near the edge; Calligraphy: A Complete Guide, A Beginners Guide to Graffiti, an SAT workbook, The Divine Comedy, a leather-bound copy of The Hobbit and The Fair-Haired Boy. My laptop sits open, an InDesign document glowing on the screen. Here I am happy. I created A Beginners\\' Guide to Graffiti, painstakingly drawing each of the 40 pages by hand before scanning them and formatting them for print. The Fair-Haired Boy, however,is the book of which I am most proud; my name lies under the words \\'written and edited by\\' on its cover. I wrote this 164-page biography of my grandfather from interviews I conducted in the last months of his life. With each interview his words grew quieter and slower, but they never lost their potency. The week before he died, my grandfather held the first edition in his hands, examining the pages of his life as the room vibrated with silence, an acceptance of both death and immortality on his face. Simple letters artfully crafted on a plain page. This pleases me\\\\u2014creating something contemporary and useful that could last for a millennium, immortal in the face of time.  Through this project I taught myself InDesign (the publishing software) and brought my typography into the modern age\\\\u2014though my love of pen and ink remains strong. With InDesign, what was once solely a personal pleasure can be expressed and shared on a global scale. It opens the door to a new interplay of design aspects: text, pictures, spacing, all working together to present a powerful message in an alluring way. I feel most complete and content at my desk, yet this single wonderful space cannot contain my active passions\\\\u2014surfing in cold California waters or exploring the City with friends. The solitary nature of my desk satisfies and stimulates me, but I am also a very communal person. I love company, crowds, and the hum of conversation. This balance best captures who I am: outgoing yet introspective, busy yet with space to rejuvenate, wild yet elegant, social yet solitary. As I sit in a local cafe writing these words, the gentle buzz of people is a comfort that helps me concentrate. Later, a friend will ask, \\'What\\'s on your fingers?\\' I\\'ll look down and smile; they are still ink-stained from the night before at my cherished desk. Beaming, I will reply, \\'Happiness! \"}, {\"index\": 783, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  A lot of things have changed throughout my life: where I live, my school, and my friends. Yet, she hasn\\'t changed. She\\'s been with me my whole life, through the good times and, especially, the bad times. I don\\'t know what I\\'d do without her. I met her in first grade, but we were far from being best friends. There was a time when my parents forced us to spend time together; talking to her was hard, frustrating, and confusing. After a few years I asked to get rid of her. I was fed up. Still a small child, I could think of a million things that would be more fun than being stuck indoors with her. Talking to her was just so difficult. I would misspeak and hear her mocking laughter, or fail to speak and hear her crushing silence; it was a terrifying experience. Had it not been for my parents, I would have pushed her away in frustration. In 9th grade, my teacher, probably as bored as I was with scales and children\\'s songs, taught me how to express sorrow: Tchaikovsky. It was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. I could translate my emotions into a tangible form in a way language never had let me. I played Barcarolle: June non-stop, with no regard for the current season or the neighbors. Everything had changed once I could make myself understood. My phrases stopped stuttering. I could lay my emotions naked before her and she would sing with understanding.  I had discovered a new language, and it was incredibly exciting. I begged for more. I was shown the playfulness of Chopin\\'s Mazurkas. Debussy taught me how to express pure joy in Claire de Lune and La Fille aux Cheveux de Lin. One day, I learned to scream: Rachmaninoff. I felt so powerful. I made the walls shake with the stress of my anger. Never before had I been able to howl at the top of my lungs and be looked on with encouragement. For me, music is a language, and it\\'s been comforting to know I\\'ll always have my piano to talk to. The way in which I can revel in my happiness, proclaim my anger, and wallow in my sadness is incomparable. It\\'s strange, but I\\'m most at peace when I\\'m thundering the climax of Rachmaninoff\\'s Prelude in C# Minor. My piano has been there to listen to me when no one else has. Looking back, I\\'m not sure how I would have dealt with my emotions without our hours of talk therapy.  My renditions of classical music have never been about perfection, nor about mimicking the play of a musical genius now long dead. All musical performances are an act of interpretation: neither entirely the performer\\'s voice, nor entirely the voice of a deceased virtuoso. Playing music is a unique and creative process, the result different every time. My musical interpretations are an understanding between musicians that transcends time, space, and death. The creative potential music holds is what makes the piano endlessly fascinating to me. I\\'m now faced with the realization that I\\'ll have to leave her behind. Separated by continents, I\\'ll have lost my outlet for my emotions and creativity. The prospect of facing the world without her is scary, but it\\'s comforting to know I won\\'t have lost this foreign language. College will be stressful, and I think I\\'ll need, and want to play, music more than ever. College will offer an environment where I can speak more often to others in this foreign language, and understand what others have to say. It will hurt to say goodbye to her, since I wouldn\\'t have made it this far without her. I guess I\\'ll have to take solace in the knowledge that somewhere, there awaits another piano who will understand me just as well. \"}, {\"index\": 784, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]      I looked in the mirror, eyes adjusting to the bathroom\\'s dim light, and barely recognized the person who stared back. It was the same backpacker who had left Kings Canyon just days before - the same lanky build, the same torn beige pants, the same dark orange shirt. The dirt and matted hair didn\\'t alarm me. Most of what looked like a deep tan would wash off at the first shower. But the way the shirt hung on my body seemed strange, like a coat on a hanger, with a creepy emptiness where there should have been flesh and muscle. My face looked thin too, my cheeks hollow, my lips horribly cracked from the altitude and sun.     This was far from my first wilderness trip, and it wasn\\'t my first time being this dirty - last summer, a friend had told me I \\'looked like death\\' after two weeks in New Mexico\\'s backcountry. But while the salt lines on my shirt weren\\'t new, the exhaustion was. I\\'d backpacked hundreds of miles before, including some 27-mile days and 12,000-foot passes, but never had I felt so absolutely broken. It had been only five days since my partner and I, both 16 years old, had struck out alone into the heart of the Sierra Nevada. Our path was a 50-mile crossing of the range on a storied course known as the \\'High Route\\'. There were no trails to follow; instead, a rather cavalier guidebook led us through a nightmarish maze of pathless slabs and boulder fields to reach the eastern side of the mountains.     That first Sierra expedition will always be burned into my mind as a paragon of adventure. The entire experience was so alien: I had no idea that such strenuous backpacking existed, and the beauty of the mountains is so much bigger than any picture or words can convey. The Sierra high country is a moonscape of granite waves, white-capped peaks cresting in thousand-foot breakers over forested troughs, resplendent in their sublime majesty.     Although I have learned more with every expedition to the Sierra, the mountains still find ways to surprise me. Ten months later I stood in the same roadhouse, with the same partner, about to return to the high country. For all our improved planning, within six miles of the trailhead we encountered another obstacle: the high passes were covered with four feet of treacherous, unstable snow. Ice axes in hand, we climbed the steep white slopes and vanquished the entire 130-mile trek. Two months later, I introduced my father to the Sierra, and together we took on the 13,157-foot Mount Ritter - but once again, the mountains reminded me who was in charge. A thunderstorm descended, a rising stream trapped us, and after hours stuck on a tiny ledge, a helicopter rescued us.     I don\\'t go to these places because they are welcoming. They aren\\'t. The hostility is part of the appeal. I go because I can trust the Sierra to subject me to challenges I\\'ve never dreamed of, expose me to beauty I\\'ve never imagined, and when I get home, supply me with memories I\\'ll never forget. The situations encountered in the backcountry demand a level of focus which is entirely foreign to most of us. Sometimes, for miles at a time, each step has the potential to throw me off a precipice; other times, for much shorter distances, I\\'ll quite literally climb a cliff face with a forty-pound backpack. It\\'s in these extreme situations that I can test myself most effectively: everything else falls away; in that moment, it\\'s just me and the mountain.     But when the day\\'s done, when I curl up into my sleeping bag or put my boots up on the shelf at home, I feel stronger, and all the pain is worthwhile. When I\\'ve taken on the wilderness and won, I know I\\'m ready for anything civilization has to throw at me. \"}, {\"index\": 785, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] My background is too unique to leave unexplained. I am from a very rare demographic. I was raised by old fashioned agriculture, consisting of ranches and cowboys. My parents are both absolutely devoted to their careers in cows, horses, and hay. They brought me up in that special environment, an opportunity a small amount of people get to have. An appropriate analogy for my heritage is a cowboy riding horseback in a wide open pasture looking for cows.  There is an extremely small amount of individuals with knowledge of true cow work and I am very fortunate to have such knowledge. I learned the methods of true ranching from two of the best cow workers I know: my parents. I grew up on ranches that were many miles from a town. Sleep overs, birthday parties, and other social gatherings were not a part of my childhood. Needless to say, as a child, my brother was my best friend.  My parents wanted my brother and me to be brought up knowing how to work on a ranch properly. They taught me how to ride a horse before I knew how to spell my name. By the time I was seven, I had herded cows enough to learn cow sense. Cow sense is the ability to look at a cow and know what her temper is like, where she wants to go, and if she wants to move easily. With that sense, I know where I need to position myself to effectively move her to where I want her to go. This advanced awareness of cows comes only from working with them for a lifetime. The combination of my competence riding horses and moving cows has made me a skilled ranch hand. Being raised on ranches as an employee rather than an heir has taught me to respect the true importance of hard work. Ranches do not operate themselves, and most owners cannot perform the entirety of the required tasks. My family has migrated to and from different ranches as ranch hands. We do the hard labor of ranch work, such as calving, raising hay, maintenance of fences, and countless other difficult tasks. The work is hard, but intriguing and enlightening at the same time. When I bring in a cow struggling to give birth, I feel very accomplished to help her birth the calf despite the subzero temperatures of calving season\\\\u2015rancher\\'s term for the months of January to May when their cow herds give birth to calves. This summer, I worked 60 to 70 hours a week. Although the hours were long, I felt very accomplished with the abundance of hay that the ranch produced this year, double what we produced last year. Ranch work is not easy, but it is very rewarding. My heritage as a rancher has given me skills shared by few other students and has taught me that great results only come from great work. If I do not spend time properly adding water to a meadow and ensuring that the water is moved every day, the grass will not grow to its potential. Much the same is true in school. If I do not take interest in lectures and take effective notes, then my grade will reflect such shortcomings. Ranching has taught me to regard work ethic as my most important trait as an academician. I am a true cowboy in every sense of the word. Although I do not wear spurs, chaps, or other typical paraphernalia, I have been the cowboy riding a pasture looking for cows more times than I can count. Ranch work ethic and academic work ethic are each rewarding in their own sense. Therefore, they coincide very well and I am fortunate to possess both. I am a cowboy and an intellectual in one body.  \"}, {\"index\": 786, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I am a nerd. Usually this conjures images of \\'bookish\\', \\'antisocial\\', or \\'know-it-all\\', with people preferring to label a fact-wielding teenager as \\'nerd\\' rather than to understand the person beneath the stereotype. My own idea of a \\'nerd\\' is someone who has a true love for learning and who strives to understand everything around her, from Higgs-Boson particles to the Marvel Universe, from oligopolistic game theory to complicated board games. Thus, it should go without saying that the place where I am most content is where learning is encouraged, embraced, and appreciated. Somewhere I can study what I want, when I want, without fear of judgment for enjoying it. Somewhere like Academic Team, the club that has taken over my life for the past three years, in a profound and very good way. Being the \\'new kid\\' at a public school of 2500+ students three years ago, after homeschooling for 8 years and attending private school for a semester, was undeniably overwhelming. Nobody understood why the new girl knew so many random facts about everything, but they didn\\'t really care, either. I think I was a bit alien to them, unaccustomed as I was to school culture. Entering sophomore year, I had earned excellent grades but lacked both friends and activities to occupy my active mind. With my anime school folders, my \\'time turner\\' necklace, and my Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy miniature towel, I was a stereotypical nerd, throwing myself into reading and learning as much as possible. Neither the terms of every US president nor the plots of major operas were safe from me and my quest for knowledge. Ultimately, all of the studying and memorizing paid off. I found my niche within the culture of my huge school: Academic Team. It gave me a place where I could be myself, free of social pressure to conform to the academic apathy that pervaded the halls. I always have loved playing quiz shows (I still watch Jeopardy every day!), so when the announcement came that the club was accepting new members, I attended practice as often as possible, even going to Varsity practices to gain experience, though I was on the JV team. Our team gradually grew, from two to four to an eventual ten, all lured by the prospect of nerd heaven-on-Earth in the form of endless trivia. We laugh, joke, study, stress, and compete together, bonding over a shared love of knowledge. A core group has been competing together for three years, sharing in victories at the district, region, and state level (2 year champions), even placing as high as 5th at national competitions. We look forward to making history for our school, the first team to win eight Academic Team competitions and to be nationally ranked. So, what does all of this mean? This essay is supposed to tell what type of person I am, what I enjoy doing, how likely I am to succeed. I could write about my family, friends, or volunteering at my church and in my community. I could tell of my academic achievements, leadership experience, or love of the Japanese language and culture. But if I\\'m to narrow down the focus to what is at the core of everything, it would be this: I love knowledge. Underlying it all, I love celebrating information and understanding, I love the power it gives us when we learn and grow, I love learning and being with people who feel the same. This is why Academic Team is my favorite place to be, where I am the happiest, and why I hope to inspire others to embrace their inner nerd. While I may only have a year left in this club, I will always cherish what the experience has taught me about being myself and pursuing my dreams, regardless of how others may label me. I am a nerd, and I wear that badge proudly. \"}, {\"index\": 787, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I belong to a small group of girls who can say they fertilized sea anemone eggs, performed an ultrasound, and created a research poster, all within six weeks.  In the summer after my freshman year, I applied for a program at UCSD called the Oncofertility Saturday Academy. To my delight, I was one of the fourteen girls chosen out of forty applicants to participate in this program. Over six weeks we explored the field of oncofertility\\\\u2014the preservation of fertility in cancer patients.  We met twice a week to discuss college-level material including cancer biology, in vitro fertilization, and reproductive bioethics. On weekends we visited some of the most advanced technology labs in Southern California, testing out innovative equipment and speaking with professionals in the field. One day we dissected mice, marveling at their tiny reproductive organs. The next we visited a fertility clinic, taking turns peering through a gigantic microscope at the wriggling sperm beneath. Although the days were lengthy and the material difficult to learn, each time I went home eager to research more about that day\\'s topic.  Each participant was required to create a research poster and present it to a panel of scientists in an evaluative judging session. For weeks I sifted through medical journals and publications to create a research poster about cervical cancer in mice exposed to a drug called diethlystilbestrol. After the evaluation session, I was chosen to present my poster at the Oncofertility Conference at Northwestern University, in which specialists from all over the world meet every year to discuss the latest developments in the field.  The conference was stimulating, filled with presentations on topics like ovarian stimulation and oocyte cryopreservation. I covered pages and pages with notes, trying to absorb all the incredible information. Yet at the conference what stood out most was that nearly every presenter and even the majority of attendees were male. I was aware that men dominated science careers, but it seemed that field focused on childbirth should be the exception. And while these men had good intentions, I was appalled that women were not more involved in a conference concerned with female fertility. I felt transported back to a previous era, one where gender restrictions were all too present.  My experience at the conference exposed me to the larger issue. Here was \\'real world\\' science rather than the lifeless, textbook science I was used to. Yet the reality is that in science, a discipline based on cutting-edge developments and positive change, women are approached with an outdated attitude\\\\u2014 a slightly evolved form of the same mindset that kept women in kitchens for centuries.   This is the world I come from: one where I\\'m surrounded by male counterparts, in which I\\'m often singled out, simply for being a girl. Here I am minority, a rare and unusual specimen, an anomaly in an unbalanced society. I chose this world and I have experienced the discrimination firsthand. But I choose to remain in this world because I understand the importance of the female perspective. Since the conference I made a commitment to promote women in science by participating in likeminded programs like BE WiSE, which exposes women to the variety of careers within the STEM fields. In addition, I helped establish an all-girl\\'s robotics team after enduring three years as the only girl in the robotics club. With these efforts, I have received encouraging responses from teachers, parents and classmates, however, plenty of room for progress remains. I may not know exactly where my education will take me, but until the gender gap that infects this field of study is closed, I will continue to advocate for women in science.  \"}, {\"index\": 788, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I sat at a patio table, surrounded by my closest friends.  The summer sun shined down on me as I recounted for them the time my English teacher held a chair up to my face, asking me to think about purpose.  Laughing, a friend countered with his story of an underwater robotics experiment gone awry, and the water he had to mop up from around the classroom.  We had to pause to catch our breath from laughter. Junior year had been tough, and it felt great to let go at my friend\\'s annual end-of-year bonfire.  We played Frisbee; we joked; we had burgers and lemonade and potato chips.  More than anything else, we talked; we chatted about school, the state of global politics, and which smartphone was the best.Next came time for the signature event\\\\u2014the bonfire.  The lighter clicked, and a few moments later the kindling was ablaze.  Each partygoer stepped up to the fire to add the past year\\'s most difficult, frustrating work to the giant yellow flames. \\'Take that!\\' or \\'glad that\\'s over\\' would accompany the thrust of a packet into the fire.  But, a few hours earlier, as I stared at the mound of paper representing hundreds of hours of my work, I couldn\\'t bring myself to take anything along.  The process didn\\'t feel right. Each time I picked up a piece of paper, I was whisked back to the moment of discovery that had led to its completion. Those 8.5 x 11 sheets told the story of the little experiences that, together, made up my year.  Burning my work felt oddly like burning away those memories.Near the bottom of the pile, I came across a worksheet that my calculus teacher dubbed the \\'Greatest Worksheet Ever.\\'  It unveils the 1st fundamental theorem of calculus, that differentiation and integration are inverses.  As I held it, I felt again the excitement that had gripped me while I unraveled this important truth, a truth that has since become a part of who I am.  Calculus is fascinating. It explains and predicts the workings of the systems all around me.  I couldn\\'t discard any moment of that learning.My digging had disrupted the delicate balance of the pile, and my U.S. history notebook slid towards me. As I turned the pages of the small blue composition book, so full of life, I happened to flip to my page on D-Day. During that class, I had caught a precious glimpse into the lives of those people who, 70 years ago, changed the course of history.  I loved learning about this historic moment and how moments like this have built upon each other to lead to the world I know today. I wanted to hold onto the collection of moments found in that little blue notebook. Off to the side, I found a chorale of mine, written the night of the music theory lesson on four-part harmony.  I hummed through each part, then tried to hear all four at once in my head. The chorale was not my best work. At the time of its creation, I hadn\\'t even learned many important elements of composition. But that piece of paper reminded me of my eagerness to employ a new skill.  I\\'d played music for years, but had just been handed the tools to make music\\\\u2014and that\\'s exactly what I did, the first chance I got.  I couldn\\'t let go of that learning either.  New abilities, new discoveries, new information\\\\u2014I found it again and again, as I poured through a year\\'s worth of work.  Each piece of paper was a nugget of myself, chronicling my intellectual growth.  I stood up to leave my room, looking back at my mountain of knowledge.  A few minutes later, I pulled into my friend\\'s driveway. It was no coincidence though that I had left my schoolwork at home, unharmed.   \"}, {\"index\": 789, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  I am the youngest of four siblings. My oldest brother, Sam, is a Marine Colonel. I\\'ve shared a bedroom with the other two, Milton and Basilia, for the past seventeen years. We haven\\'t always gotten along\\\\u2014 they made fun of me all the time and I frequently pretended they didn\\'t exist. But now we\\'re ok. I mean, we don\\'t talk much because they\\'re stuffed platypi and all, but I\\'m quite fond of them. And I think they\\'re quite fond of me, too.  You see, in my family, it is illegal to take yourself seriously. And if you cannot accept that you have three stuffed platypi for siblings, and that the one once left in a motel in Massachusetts is actually a Marine helicopter pilot, then you are taking yourself far too seriously.Our family has a good reason for this rule: you can\\'t be a happy person if you can\\'t laugh at yourself and your mistakes. And so we laugh. A lot. There has not been a day in my life when we three (six) haven\\'t at least snickered at each other. I\\'ve snorted quite a bit of milk from my nose.In a family of this much laughter, you can probably guess that it\\'s important to be funny. We\\'re definitely a little ridiculous. My father is a commercial lawyer Monday through Friday; but on the weekends he is a revolutionary war reenactor who dons a musket, a red coat, and a kilt to fight for King George. My mother is an actor, choreographer, and one of the original Dirty Dancers (yes, from the movie)\\\\u2014 we still have her metallic miniskirt in the house somewhere. It\\'s great having them as parents; but with these goofs running my life, there\\'s a whole lot of pressure here to be silly. Especially for someone like me. Realize that I am a quiet person\\\\u2014 I like my room and my cray-pas. I like studying and biology. I love science. I would play guitar and paint all day if I had the time. Weird, coming from that pair, right? But they decided a while ago that, quiet as I am, I still have to be a Getz-Morris. That I, too, have a duty to be ridiculous. So what else could they possibly do but haze me? Initiation rights were extensive. To make a funny gal, I could never be punished\\\\u2014 only mocked for my mistakes. Ballads were written about any major screw up. Pun wars have been frequent and ruthless. My own mother has pantsed me, twice. They have never gone for the solid, child-services approved parenting choice\\\\u2014 always for the funny. What my nutjob parents have really been doing all this time, though, is so subtle you might miss it if you blink. Or maybe not. By giving me an obligation\\\\u2014 nay, a duty to be funny, they have made me enjoy my failures. They have made my darkest moments into great dinner party stories. They even gave me siblings\\\\u2014 cuddly ones that don\\'t poop\\\\u2014 for when I get lonely. In a world like this one, those goofballs managed to give me all the tools to be happy. And for a teenage girl, happy\\'s a pretty rare thing to be.  I\\'ve had a pleasant life\\\\u2014 no dead relatives, no poverty, no interesting flaws or adventures. I\\'ve never faced much adversity and the most exotic place I\\'ve been is Canada. There is really no one story or experience that defines me. But you know what? I have funny parents; and if they have done one thing, they have made certain that I will never be dull.  \"}, {\"index\": 790, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] My childhood experience drove me to set such high goals for myself.  As a child, I had everything I needed; this included harmony, happiness, and health. My family was by no means wealthy but my parents had great jobs and they managed to own their own home. In a sense that was the peak of unity and joy for my family. Regretfully, the world came crashing down on us when my father was fired from his managerial position at the \\'Sedano\\'s\\' supermarket and we were forced to move from our nice home in Miami to a shady neighborhood in Tampa, Florida. Ever since then, I\\'ve been longing to bring back that balance through my success. Considering all that had happened, my life became a series of economic challenges. I moved from Miami, to Tampa, to Hialeah in a span of six years. I remember reading somewhere that the average person moves seven times in their lifetime. I\\'ve moved eight times in my seventeen years of life and the ninth will be when I go away to college. In essence, moving has become common to me while it is a hassle for others. Given that my economic status is unfavorable, there have been times when I have lacked in technological luxuries. In a country that is experiencing a technological revolution, it\\'s hard to get by in school without a computer. I endured my whole freshman year without a computer, but I didn\\'t let this put me down. I consistently went to libraries and friend\\'s houses to get my assignments done. It was difficult to stay focused and put in the extra work of walking to libraries but my strong will led me to finish every assignment efficiently and punctually. I never allowed my deficiency to hold me back. Due to my moving conditions, I\\'ve never had a stable group of friends. In spite of this, I have managed to surround myself with the right people. They are people with the same aspirations as myself: A+ students who have realistic goals and plans. My friends are the kind of people I want to surround myself with when I reach the collegiate level. We can share ideas and collaborate as well as compete against each other. For college, I yearn for an environment that makes me feel like I can establish a symbiotic relationship with anyone that\\'s around me in which everyone becomes a better individual. Prior to my enlightenment of the opportunities that I had available, I was intimidated by colleges of higher education. I thought that I would have to attend a state university because I did not have enough money to afford education from a reputable school. That all changed when I went to a college fair. That day my eyes were opened to the plethora of opportunities I had available for me despite my financial hardships. My determination grew exponentially and I was able to find programs like Questbridge that could help people like me get into the schools of our dreams. My aspirations were fueled when I toured the University of Miami campus with a former alumni. I got to experience a little taste of college life and I was fascinated by it. The chance to be independent and hardworking to reach an ultimate objective became incredibly enticing to me. It made me realize that I\\'m ready for that life. All of my life experiences, especially my most recent ones have led me to where I am today. I\\'ve become incredibly active and focused on my work and in my community. I\\'ve always enjoyed studying and expanding my knowledge. My knowledge allows me to think in different and abstract ways and I truly enjoy being able to utilize my abilities for the betterment of myself and the people I wish to represent. Although I have learned so much already, my mind is still fresh and ready to be refined. In the end, accomplishing so much in my high school career with such limited resources has been more than gratifying. I acknowledge that my academics will only be that much harder in college, but I know my dedication is unmatched. Wherever I go I will indubitably succeed. I thrive in the midst of challenges. Wherever there\\'s an obstacle to overcome is where I belong. I\\'ve already endured so many struggles, but it\\'s made me vigilant and prepared for whatever my life throws at me.  \"}, {\"index\": 791, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] What did the teacher just say? As the only student sitting, I anxiously scanned the room, struggling to interpret the jumbled words and movements. My eyes fixed on a girl who seemed to know what to do as she placed notebooks onto an isolated table. Okay, so we\\'re supposed to put our school supplies there, I concluded. As I placed my binder and colored pencils onto the desk, the teacher instructed us to sit down. I would later realize that the table was for donations, a word I did not know then. I had just unknowingly donated my colored pencils\\\\u2014a farewell present from my father.This first day of school in America continued in the same disorienting blur. Little did I know, this whirlwind of a day was the beginning of a journey that would transform me in inconceivable ways. I was in third grade, and my mother, brothers, and I had just immigrated to America while my father worked in Taiwan. Amid culture shock, my brothers and I despised the American culture. I dreaded fastening seatbelts and treading the mysterious land of tacos. What is ranch dressing? Why do people voluntarily eat raw celery? Eventually, my second brother seamlessly integrated into American society; nonetheless, my other brother and I scorned America and clung to all things Taiwanese.When I was in sixth grade, my mother frequently traveled to Taiwan for cancer treatment. Drained from ceaseless goodbyes and schedule changes, my family finally decided to return to Taiwan. I was ecstatic. Ever since the first day on American soil, I had been itching to escape America to connect with my \\'Taiwanese roots.\\' After six years confined in the Land of the Free, I was finally returning to where I belonged!Through attending an American high school in Taiwan and teaching at English camps in Asia, I gradually learned that I had been wrong. In my mind, I had glorified Taiwan as a place where students could relax and revel in the breathtaking mountain scenery and stinky tofu. Instead, I witnessed my cousins spending weekends in cram school to prepare for exams, with limited time to enjoy the Taiwanese culture that I cherished. In Asian education, what ultimately matters is rote memorization to boost the final score on the nine-hour-long university entrance exams. I, on the other hand, am fortunate enough to evade this pressure because I attend an American school. While my love for Taiwan has not diminished in the slightest, witnessing Asian education at play cast a new light on my American background, especially in schooling.The American educational system, though far from perfect, fosters skills such as creativity and innovation. Passionate teachers, exemplified by my former English teacher (a real-life Santa Claus complete with a bushy beard and round glasses), instill in students a thirst to explore and invent, cultivating incredible traits, hobbies, and passions. Students become multifaceted and analytical from being exposed to the melting pot of people. Having Native American, African American, and Indian friends has taught me about countries, people, and cultures in a way that will never be paralleled by a textbook. Furthermore, I have learned to speak fluently the universal language of English, allowing me to share, research, and collaborate in ways I never could have anticipated if I had not left Taiwan.Even though I lost the colored pencils from my father, I will never lose the effects of the best and most self-sacrificing gift he could have given me: the gift of American education. While I still embrace my Taiwanese cultural heritage, I also realize that living in America provided more opportunities and transformed me in ways I never could have envisioned. By returning to Taiwan, I have come to realize that I am blessed: blessed to have moved to America, blessed to be in the American educational system, blessed to be an American. \"}, {\"index\": 792, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]             Sweating, shaking, and bouncing nervously, I reach the starting line and turn to face the incoming stampede. Extending a nervous hand behind me, I reach towards the Columbia blue jersey rapidly approaching, but my eye sticks on the shiny tube of metal in her hand\\\\u2014the key to two minutes and thirty seconds of pain and bliss. The runner lands at my side, the baton lies just inches from my hand, and my heart is beating out of my chest.         This moment, as the baton gravitates above my fingers, is the start of one race, but it\\'s the culmination of dozens of races, hours upon hours of training, and years of experiences.         Slumping low in an auditorium chair, I listen to the outgoing Editor-in-Chief read the list of names with their newspaper positions. My mind races through all of the events that helped me reach this moment.         \\'Kelley Czajka, Editor-at-Large.\\'         The baton comes throttling down the straightaway.         Two years on the middle school yearbook staff, hours spent reading the school newspaper, class periods of deciphering red pen marks covering piles of drafts, and sleepless nights worrying about whether it will be enough.         \\'Tyler Jacobson, managing editor.\\'         The baton is almost within reach. My name still hasn\\'t been called. Five years of obsessing and arduous work will either pay off or fall short.         \\'Sarah Friedman, Editor-in-Chief.\\'The room bursts into applause. The baton slams into my hand and I take off running. I feel the pain in my legs and I can barely breathe, but at the 750-meter mark, 50 meters from a finish, nothing else matters. Crossing the line, I flop onto the ground as my teammates crowd around me.Laying on the ground comprises a large part of my sports career. It started in the fourth grade, when I joined a soccer team. After successfully avoiding the ball for most of the game, a teammate passed the ball to me in a pinch. I dribbled towards the goal, and next thing I knew I was face-to-face with a girl twice my size, who proceeded to take the ball from me, knock me down, and run over my face. I lay on the ground, confused, faced with the reality that I would never be a star athlete like my sister and my friends.         Now, at the finish line, I feel exhausted, sweaty, and sick\\\\u2014but at the same time, I feel on top of the world. I left everything I had on the track, and my mental toughness got me through faster than others\\' physical coordination. I now know that there are two kinds of laying on the ground. There\\'s the kind I experienced on the soccer field\\\\u2014getting knocked down. But there\\'s also the kind of laying on the ground I inflict upon myself, the kind that happens when I work my hardest.As a child with a mission, I assumed that once the editor position was mine, I would feel satisfied. I felt childhood slipping away when the baton lay in my hand. It is surreal to have this opportunity, but victory won\\'t be mine until I run it to the 800-meter mark and collapse, knowing every ounce of preparation and energy I have in me lies in the final product.As Editor-in-Chief, lying on the ground has become familiar territory. Sure, sometimes I get knocked down by deadlines and poor leadership decisions. But at the end of each day I\\'m laying on my bed dead tired, with a long to-do list at my bedside, knowing that I\\'m carrying out this job as best I can. Still, I never allow myself to accept that what I\\'m doing is enough. And I know that next year, when I pass the baton on to someone else, there will be another starting line ahead of me and another baton to grab.   \"}, {\"index\": 793, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]             My grandmother\\'s apartment stands tall amid the dirty streets of Calcutta, India. As our car rumbles out of the gates, the windows condense as the cool air-conditioning clashes with the dense midday heat. I wipe away a section of glass, and look out into a world like no other: beautiful yet terrible, humbling yet inspiring. Everything is in constant motion, while in the background, a discordance of yells, horns, and bells permeate the thick air. Cars, carts, and three-wheeled rickshaws part around the cow sleeping in the middle of the street like water around a rock. A beautiful Indian woman smiles at me from a large billboard, holding a bottle of lotion and showing off her flawless complexion. Underneath the billboard, an old lady draped in a worn cloth sari struggles to carry a jug of water. Towering steel buildings intermingle with run-down slums. As our car passes an alley, a ragged boy my age crouches away from the relentless sun, hoping for a few meager coins to drop into his outstretched hands. I sit back in the cool car and let the window fog back up. It was here that I learned appreciation and humbleness.            An explosion of color greets us as we exit the stadium. Trumpets, shouts, and victorious chants propel us outside, towards the heart of San Jose, Costa Rica, where the streets are choked with rejoicing people. The soccer match was over, but the celebrations were not. Shining red, white and blue flags stood out against the dark night sky. The bright lights of celebratory fires, streetlamps, and buildings lit up the shadow cast by the illuminated Estadio Nacional, as euphoric masses continued to flood the streets. Everything is glowing- whether with light or pure passion, it is hard to tell. As we meander our way through the crowd, every face is lit up with a smile. There is no difference in status, wealth, or even age. There is only Costa Rica: resplendent and unified. Even we, as outsider Americans, feel truly at home as we are engulfed in the tide of jubilation. It was here that I learned what true joy is.                 We are perched hundreds of feet above the calm lake, the result of a steep hike through the darkening forest. In the distance, the sunset blazes bright hues of orange, profiling the natural beauty of Glen Arbor, Michigan. The sandy cliff melts seamlessly into the beach far below. I gaze across the horizon, arms resting on the soft, warm sand, simply marveling at the sheer magnificence of the sight before us. A cool breeze dances across the surface of the water, sending out ripples that seem to travel to the edge of the earth. As the sun dips lower and lower, the lake turns a deeper blue, as the light reflecting off the surface dims. When the sun finally disappears among the clouds covering the skyline, our group takes one last look at the vast expanse before us, and heads back through the darkened woods. It was here that I learned what pure beauty looks like.                I have had the fortune of witnessing the extreme polarity of the world, some of its very best, but also some of its very worst. It\\'s strange that there could be a place as beautiful as the northern lakes, while elsewhere a place so stricken by poverty. That there could be a place so consumed with joy, while at the same time a place where each day is a struggle.  Traveling has been and will continue to be one of the most important aspects of my life, both shaping and broadening my mind. It has helped me appreciate everything I have today, and all of the new situations, places, and cultures I encounter. It is integral to me, and I can\\'t wait to see the wonders that my future holds. \"}, {\"index\": 794, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The first time I held my nephew in my arms, I was thirteen years old. Until then, I had never met such a tiny human being. I had never met someone so blissfully unaware of their surroundings. He did not know that his father would have to work through every available overtime shift just to raise him, or that I would have to pay for my notebooks in coins and landscape nearly every yard in the neighborhood to buy his school shoes. He did not have to worry. All he had to do was sleep in my arms, and I loved that. Two years after his birth, I began studying another love of mine: Quantum Field Theory. Because of this, the gap between my knowledge and my nephew\\'s continues to grow almost as quickly as the love that I hold for him. While he is concerned with speaking in comprehensible sentences, I am concerned with reading graduate texts regarding astrophysics. Every time I meet with my research advisor, I learn more about worlds much smaller than ours and much larger than ours. The processes in the larger worlds are described in Einstein\\'s General Theory of Relativity. In this theory, wormholes can be tunnels between two spatial planes. At the tunnel\\'s heart, unimaginable amounts of matter pass through a single point, and atoms are torn into their smallest parts: quantum particles. These miniscule particles are little dimples and peaks in boundless fields, which work together to make matter, light, energy, and gravity. Physicists struggle to wrap their minds around the way quanta travel through the center of a wormhole. When we try to calculate it, the equations result in a nightmare\\\\u2014infinite summations of infinity. Our current numerical language is too limited to apply the concepts of the very big, General Relativity, to the physics of the very small, Quantum Field Theory. However, the harmonious symphony of mathematics and scientific research earnestly compels me to express the currently inexpressible connection between measurable points in fields and the seemingly infinite forces which act upon them.  My research has taken me to the ends of the universe within a simple office. I take comfort in the idea that our planet might just be a tiny speck in a swirling dust mote in a rapidly expanding multiverse. Every answer in astrophysics begs another question, and I find beauty in the answer\\'s dependence on an equation, a university, and a scientist\\'s imagination. Every time I commence my pursuit for solutions to astrophysics\\' dilemmas, the sensation of chalk between my fingers is inspiring. Those particles of white dust help me fill black boards with equations describing the workings of the cosmos. Our bubble, which exists in a foam called the multiverse, allows humans to create language and feel love; to express ourselves in art and enter altered states of consciousness; to cure and eradicate diseases. I love to feel the sun\\'s warm light on my cheek because physics created our sun, which gives me life and lets me thrive in an ambition that requires ardent inquisitiveness. During my fall semester in college, my nephew will turn five. One day, my father will inevitably tell him that I worked multiple odd jobs to buy tattered textbooks. My nephew will find out that I gave up many internship offers because we could not afford child care. My nephew must know, however, that I am going to college because I need this remarkable opportunity. I have worked to satisfy the demands of my expanding galaxy of priorities ever since he was born, but as he grows, the financial burden is easier to handle. It is time for me to focus on my education and my research. I just hope that when he learns of my career, he looks up at the stars with the same wonder and devotion I felt when I was a child\\\\u2014that I still feel today. \"}, {\"index\": 795, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 796, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] To Build a Fire\\'Come on, Come on, COME ON!\\' I muttered as I stroked the bow of my freshly carved bow drill, twisting the soft pine piston into the cedar base plate. My bare left foot stabilized the base. I drilled frantically, trying to warm up after a freezing, rainy night in my haphazard debris shelter. The night before when the weather was clear, I made a sturdy lean-to structure out of fallen limbs and dry leaves which I\\'d been convinced was impervious to all kinds of weather. After dark, a monsoon-like rain started and somehow the drops found every single little crack that I had missed and worked their way through the thick covering of leaves. I was soaked to the bone. Shivering violently. As any good outdoorsman knows, August is the month in which the most people die of hypothermia. I really needed this fire. I stroked for a few minutes longer, and a slow gentle trickle of smoke began to appear. I stopped and fed the flame with my precious store Birch bark and dry tinder. Finally, I leaned back against a White Oak for a sparse breakfast of Dandelion greens and Hemlock tea.My friends think that the mountains are a big scary wilderness where people go only to be killed by a mountain lion or an unfortunate brush with Giardia. I honestly don\\'t disagree; those are things I think about every time I go out. Some people find their thrill and sense of accomplishment at an amusement park, tackling the biggest, tallest and fastest roller coasters while conquering their fears. I\\'m not really a roller coaster guy. I don\\'t feel that same sense of excitement and extreme thrill that everyone talks about. I get my thrill and amazement every time I head out into the woods by myself to scale a cliff, or sleep in a debris shelter. Being out in the forest, surrounded only by trees isn\\'t all about \\'becoming one with nature,\\' it\\'s about testing myself and seeing what I can really do.In my everyday life, I go through the day stressing over homework, or the plans for the upcoming school dance, but these are just trivial annoyances. Nowhere in my life do I face decisions that could have life-threatening consequences; nowhere in my life am I tested constantly like I am when I\\'m out in the woods. When I\\'m surrounded by fifty miles of backcountry wilderness, I don\\'t really worry about the next math assignment, I worry about whether I have the skills and fitness to make it to the next camp, to cross the raging stream, or light a fire after relentless rains.When I\\'m standing in front of my peers, wearing a striped bowtie and a fitted tweed blazer with a satin flower on my lapel, no one knows me as the guy who sleeps barefoot in a debris shelter. But as I stand in front of my classmates, talking about the applications of Chaos Theory and Fractal Geometry to stock market prediction, I am able to speak with a confidence that mirrors my sureness as I walk barefoot through a pine forest. I am the kid who slaves away on his computer writing code and building apps for NASA, but I\\'m also the kid who sleeps in a cave in a torrential rainstorm. Being in the woods alone, provides a challenge that cannot be emulated in the classroom, and a sense of danger much greater than roller coasters. For me, the wilderness, especially when I am shivering and struggling to light a fire without matches, is where I am most content, where I am most challenged, and where I am forced to condense and use every bit of common sense, every shred of intuition, and every bit of classroom wisdom I have acquired over the years. \"}, {\"index\": 797, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 798, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 799, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Of all the things in this world, a 40 minute show of Ben-10, a television series, defined almost everything in my life.I\\'d just finished middle school when I first watched Ben-10. I initially liked the show because the lead character Ben, a boy who transforms into different aliens to fight bad aliens, hated school. I too hated middle school because of teachers who derived pleasure out of forcing me to eat bad canteen food, and this similarity maintained my interest.Slowly, Ben-10 started to affect every aspect of my life, and I became a big fan of it. Most of my 9th grade was spent dreaming of an alien attack on my neighborhood, then saving the neighborhood along with my crush and living happily ever after. Though my teacher did not appreciate the questions on how we could successfully merge Human and Dog DNA to create \\'a powerful human-dog\\', it was Ben-10 which instilled basic curiosity in me. Gwenn-a character in series-once said that asking questions makes you smarter. I took her words to my heart, and I started to enjoy asking questions.But Ben-10 didn\\'t just give me the quality which I value the most, it also got me interested in 2 things I love to do today: Sciences & Writing.My only motivation to study sciences in 9th grade was to develop technology which would get me superpowers of Kevin- another character in the series. The first Physics book I read got me hooked to solving questions. Also, the way Ben fights aliens is similar to how I solve the hypothetical problems I create for myself. Most of the times, I do not know enough about the subject to actually do anything, so I start reading books and taking online lectures (on edX/MIT-OCW) to gain the knowledge required to solve the problem- just like Ben learns Taekwondo from his grandfather- only to realize that the problem is unsolvable. In 10th grade, I\\'d spent the entire summer coming up with ideas about a generator that used earth\\'s lava to create electricity, and when I finally came up with a device, I was devastated to know that no metal could last in lava. This frustrated me to end, but somehow I still found myself awake every midnight making mathematical faux pas of severe intensities and rectifying them hastily-hoping no one saw those (they\\'d make for amusing YouTube videos). Science provides me emotions similar to what Ben experiences while fighting villains. I even wrote a rap freestyle for myself which I sing after solving questions just like Ben-10\\'s title song.My love for sciences defined my time high school, and Ben-10 was the reason behind it.But I\\'d wanted to be a superhero since I was a kid, and another episode of Ben-10 rekindled my desire to be one. Now, since a 5\\'11\\' boy weighing 105 pounds didn\\'t exactly fit the superhero bill physically, I\\'d to venture into writing stories. Also, the gap year I took created a void due to lack of companionship. I needed an escape from real world, and writing provided just that. I wrote for 5 hours in a day. They danced around my head- people, snippets of universe waiting to be painted, and I wanted to flood them out of my head and onto paper. I wrote many stories, but my biggest work is my unfinished fiction novel in which I live my dream of being a superhero. The lead character is a perfect embodiment of the kind of hero I want to be: super powerful, smart, little eccentric, and can eat cheese (I can\\'t eat cheese because of inflammatory bowel disease-IBD). While writing the novel, I find myself living an entirely different life, oblivious to the real life. Writing pulled me out of solitude, empowered me, and fulfilled my dream of being a superhuman.Without Ben-10, I wouldn\\'t be the person I am today. \"}, {\"index\": 800, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I\\'ve been practicing martial arts for over half of my life. Because of that, I still have trouble wrapping my head around the fact that most people retreat to a happy place where no one is yelling at the top of their lungs, the smell of sweat doesn\\'t hang in the air, and there\\'s not even the slightest chance of getting punched in the face. But that\\'s probably just because I grew up with it. My career in martial arts began shortly after I requested taekwondo lessons for my seventh birthday. Much to my dismay, I learned at my very first class that taekwondo, despite sounding like cookie dough, had nothing to do with desserts. This distress vanished when I learned that taekwondo did involve a seven-year-old\\'s second greatest interest: becoming a ninja. After about a year of working towards this aspiration, life got in the way; the summer after second grade, my family moved from sunny Southern California to the even-sunnier desert of Arizona. With no taekwondo studio in the area, I was convinced that my training had come to an end. But after a few months of shopping around, a different type of studio caught our interest: DePalma\\'s Team USA Martial Arts, which taught a style of karate known as American Kenpo. And this is where my training truly began. Over the next nine years, I continued taking classes five, sometimes even six days a week with no off-season. It was here that a large part of my transformation from an awkward and clumsy third-grader to an outgoing and slightly less clumsy high school senior took place. I\\'ve never been an exceptional athlete, but as I climbed through the belt system in the karate studio, I finally felt what it was like to improve at a sport, to trust in my ability to perform despite whatever pressure threated to weigh me down. Whether it was sparring at a local tournament, testing for my next belt or even just practicing my form in front of the other students, I knew I could count on my apprehension being washed away by a surge of confidence when I reflected on how much I had already accomplished. But even though I carry this confidence with me wherever I go, I still feel it strongest in my home away from home. Midway through my freshman year of high school, this self-assurance allowed me to take up a new challenge: getting my first job. Over the course of my training at the karate studio, I had seen a number of instructors come and go. Shortly after yet another vacancy opened up, the head instructor of the studio sat me down and asked if I\\'d be interested in assisting with classes. Given the opportunity to spend even more time training, let alone get a paycheck for it, I didn\\'t even have to think about my answer. But that night, as I sat awake in bed thinking over the day\\'s events, I realized that I had gotten in over my head. Even though I\\'d always enjoyed working with kids, especially my nine younger cousins whom I\\'d frequently been tasked with babysitting over the years, I didn\\'t know the first thing about actually teaching kids in any kind of structured environment. Yet when I went into work the next day, my misgivings melted away. I knew that learning the ropes wouldn\\'t be easy, and it would be a long time before I was half as good as the instructors I had grown up admiring, but standing in the middle of that noisy, sweaty, and occasionally painful place where I had learned time and time again that I was capable of putting in the work necessary to grow and improve, I couldn\\'t help but be optimistic.It\\'s been three years since I was hired, and while I can confidently say that I now stand as a much more knowledgeable instructor, it certainly continues to be a learning experience every day. I\\'ve found that I enjoy working with kids even more than I expected, which helped to reaffirm my decision to go into pediatrics, a field where hating children is kind of a deal breaker. And I\\'ve discovered that tackling challenges that I\\'ve never begun to prepare for isn\\'t always as difficult as it seems; I\\'m just glad I was able to do it in the safety of my home away from home.  \"}, {\"index\": 801, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] During High School, I felt that I was being pulled in so many ways. I danced my entire life, but at the high school I was attending did not take the dance program seriously. After 16 years of dedication to an art, I was not about to let all my training be thrown away. So, I aspired for more: I researched extensively for schools near me with both rigorous academics and a strong dance program. After months of arguments and drawn out conversations, I finally convinced my parents to allow me to transfer schools for my Junior year. I made the Varsity Dance Team, made new friends, excelled in the classroom, and founded Relay for Life at my new school all within a few months of starting fresh. Then that summer, I was lucky enough to travel to Oxford, England and study for one month alongside some of the brightest students around the world. There, I met some of the most remarkable people who inspired me to step out of my comfort zone and explore other areas of study. This being said, I was always on the direct path to medical school, never open to any other career or field. For some background, I was hospitalized my first week of Freshman year, and during that time, I observed doctors tediously and fell in love with the profession: All I wanted to do was heal others the way that they healed me. So up until this moment, I had never exposed my mind to other subjects to fall in love with as well. I became infatuated with political science and economics, a subject that had remained very foreign to me for so many years. When I returned home, everyone could see a significant change in my attitude and perspective on learning and school.  With this new found motivation, I gave each class an equal amount of attention and allow my mind to explore so many new topics.

My warm breath echoed within the confines of my fitted surgical mask as I nervously glanced at the camera perched on the side of the operating table, live streaming the mock-procedure to my fellow interns on the Surgical Skills Summer Internship. In that moment, I thought of Xiao Bao. I met Xiao the previous summer while volunteering at the China Care Facility in Beijing. An eight-year-old, soft-spoken boy who avoided eye contact, Xiao was confined to the borders of the facility\\'s moldy walls due to his severe medical condition. His life-threatening aortic valve regurgitation required him to wait for a valve replacement, rendering him alone and detached from other children his age. But despite his introverted and frightened demeanor, I gradually began to see glimpses of his endearing personality.On my third day at CCF, I caught Xiao peeking playfully out of the doorway of his room. Our eyes met and he quickly retreated, so I decided to play along. His peeking soon became a game and he would giggle uncontrollably when I crept up and surprised him. Each day we sat together for hours on his stiff hospital bed while I taught him the English alphabet and colored giraffes. Although we communicated exclusively in Mandarin, he would laugh endlessly whenever I mispronounced \\'bao zi\\', the Chinese word for dumpling. In the evenings he would squeal \\'jie jie\\' meaning \\'older sister\\', and beg me to stay with him. On one particular evening, I tucked him in and walked back to my room, never suspecting the traumatic morning ahead. I returned the next day with a bag of Xiao\\'s favorite \\'bao zi\\' in hand and observed as the doctor checked his vitals. Suddenly, she raised her voice and began moving quickly, enlisting the help of several nurses. His heart was failing and couldn\\'t wait any longer for the valve replacement. I sat close beside him and held his small, fragile hand as he panted and desperately tried to breathe. He looked up at me with fear in his eyes and it deeply frustrated me that there was so little I could do to help him. Minutes later, the ambulance swept Xiao away, separating our hands.Several days later when Xiao returned, I experienced a profound sense of relief and gratitude as he looked up at me and squealed \\'jie jie\\'! His infectious smile told me that my \\'little brother\\' was okay. At the time, I did not know what procedure Xiao\\'s doctors had performed, but knew that they had given him a second chance at life. On my last day at CCF, I dropped off his dumplings and watched as he played outdoors with the other children for the first time.I have always known what I wanted to do. At the age of five, I sat mesmerized by surgery shows on Discovery Channel, and practiced suturing on my stuffed animals, hoping that someday I would be able to \\'fix them\\'. Although my love for the compassionate side of medicine was clear from a young age, my experience with the technical side of surgery allowed me to integrate the two aspects and fully understand why it is I want to be a surgeon. The hands of a doctor are capable of amazing things, and I know that my hands are meant to heal. So, as I stood at the operating table, lowered the tri-leaflet tissue valve into the aorta, and snipped the sutures- I smiled to myself. I set down my needle driver, the live-streaming camera turned off, and my fellow interns applauded. I had completed my first aortic valve replacement: the same procedure that saved Xiao\\'s life.  \"}, {\"index\": 804, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I am a hardworking perfectionist; however, I also constantly misplace my homework and have a creatively distinct, sometimes illogical rationale.  I dare to fail, to forge my own opportunities and, most importantly, to pursue my dreams and aspirations.My parents were always at the top of their classes throughout their academic careers.  Their academic achievement is a common household topic.  I almost considered academic success to be a gene I inherited, as my eighth-grade-self excelled in all things scholastic.  I naturally decided to take every honors class offered in my freshman year of high school to continue the self-imposed family legacy.  I attempted to squeeze myself into the seemingly dependable box that my parents had successfully built for themselves 30 years prior.For me, it was unstable and flimsy from the start; I had no exposure to high school coursework, and I suffered from my recklessness.  I struggled to efficiently complete the barrage of daily tedious homework assignments, effectively manage my quarter-long leviathan projects, continually ignore the seductive ping of social media notifications, adequately function on three hours of sleep (at least I worked in two sleep cycles), accurately memorize diagrams of dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis of various organic molecules, and flawlessly recall dialogue of Scout\\'s exchanges with Boo Radley verbatim. My confidence dwindled; I couldn\\'t fit into the box, and I finished my first semester with grades much lower than originally anticipated, and frankly, incommensurate with my vast amounts of exerted effort.  Maybe I had overestimated my \\'scholastic excellence.\\'Most parents would have intervened before the first \\'B+,\\' but mine merely scolded me for loading too much on my plate when the six grades had already become dried ink stains on my permanent record.  At the time, I was resentful that my parents didn\\'t haggle with my teachers or enroll me in tutoring when a \\'Notice of Failure\\' arrived in the mail, but the sting of my grades was necessary for me to learn to face, embrace, and consequently, remedy my mistakes. The harsh reality of life shook me out of my sheltered stupor--my parents will not be there to cater to my juvenile inadequacies in college and beyond; I had to learn it sooner or later.  I just happened to learn it during my first semester of freshman year.Second semester, I received my first \\'A\\' on a geometry test.  It reminded me that although the past is immutable, one failure isn\\'t the end; the future is easily altered.  As my confidence in my abilities grew, I began to see my grades as a gateway to achieving my goals instead of an obstacle preventing my continuation of the family legacy.I rediscovered ambition and leadership.  I combined my love for art and technology to become a entrepreneur by creating marketing campaigns, designing promotional materials, and managing social media for my mother\\'s office.  I created and currently co-lead a STEM interest club to not only further delve into my interests, but also inspire others\\' interests in the STEM fields.I joined robotics club, where I discovered the rewarding feeling that comes with creating something transcending my own abilities, whether the ability to shoot hoops with precision or to explore the possibilities of water in space. There, I also discovered and fell in love with engineering, a career that melds my passions for creation and invention with practical application.Determined to further my intellectual development, I have challenged myself with various AP courses, particularly in the STEM fields.  I have loved many of these classes; however, AP Chemistry is the class that I became the most enamored with, as it is when I began to truly understand how impossibly intricate, yet unthinkably vast the universe is.  I would love to learn more about and find practical applications for every particle and reaction that the universe offers, from the elusive Higgs boson to the seemingly-impossible man-made nuclear fusion reaction.I plan to further increase my knowledge in both chemistry and engineering through chemical engineering at the University of Texas.  Cockrell is one of the best engineering schools in the nation, with world-class professors, laboratories, and research centers.  The University of Texas also provides undergraduate students many research collaboration opportunities with major companies.  With the combination of excellent teaching, research opportunities, and industry experience, I will be fully prepared to not only learn more about the world, but also apply my knowledge to create solutions to the world\\'s problems. A mix of the rigidity of my parents\\' personalities with the lax capriciousness of my own disposition, my personal box is jam-packed with leadership, enterprise, self-sufficiency, and innovation--it\\'s time for a bigger box. \"}, {\"index\": 805, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] It only took ten seconds to give me a new outlook on life. The most important fight of my entire taekwondo career was approaching. In a matter of minutes, I could be on the Junior World Championship team competing in Taipei, China, with a USA emblem shimmering below the black belt of my uniform.I breezed through my preliminary fights, beating every one of my opponents. Winning those four matches had qualified me for the final round that would determine who would be going to Taipei.  The final match began. We shook hands and the duel commenced.  Kicks, punches, and shouting echoed through the arena. Sweat splattered and the audience cheered. After nearly six minutes of combat, the countdown began. As I was in the lead, I could sense the sweet smell of success. 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1, DING! As the referee declared my opponent\\'s victory, my dream of attending the World Championship in Taipei evaporated.My dream shattered instantly. I felt as if my countless hours of training and preparation for this moment had been wasted.  Anger, sadness, and envy engulfed me.Although I had expected winning to become a pivotal moment in my life, it was actually the loss that became a life-defining moment for me. I was forced to make a decision; to be satisfied with being the second best, or decide that I was going to work even harder than before. By losing, I gained so much more than if I had won. Experiencing the agony of a loss  made my passion for the sport even stronger.  Although the bitterness from this loss still lingers at times, I have turned that disappointment and anger into motivation.  Ever since, I have trained more often and focused on my weaknesses to improve myself so that I can put myself in the best position for success in the future.  More than just taekwondo skills, this loss has given me a life skill. This defeat has inadvertently instilled in me the ability to learn and improve myself in several aspects of my life--from my academics and extracurricular activities to my everyday life decisions. I learned that there is always room for improvement and that I still have an abundance of learning left to accomplish.  \"}, {\"index\": 806, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I have a complex Oedipus complex: it\\'s quite difficult (impossible, really) to develop and then resolve a rivalry with my father if he does not exist. So, according to Freud, I\\'ll never form a super-ego, and I won\\'t develop a \\'moral compass.\\' Outdated psychological theories can be rather frustrating!It\\'s been a rollercoaster ride growing up with two mothers, but I imagine that childhood is often turbulent, no matter who one\\'s parents are. As time has passed, however, I\\'ve come to greatly appreciate my family structure. I\\'ve even entertained the radical idea that all kids should have to grow up with two moms - at least for a part of their lives. We\\'re impacted so much by the people who raise us, and I can confidently attribute my respect for women, belief in diversity, and nonviolent nature to growing up with the two independent, strongly-principled feminists I have the privilege of calling my mothers. Not surprisingly, however, I haven\\'t always had such an appreciative perspective.In 5th grade, I had a good friend named Harry. We\\'d been in classes together for a few years, and - like typical 5th-graders - we connected through sports, smarts, and silly jokes. One day in science class, the topic of what our dads did for a living arose. When my turn came, I sheepishly muttered, \\'I have two moms.\\' Many of my classmates already knew of my family structure, but the temporary look of shock and disapproval that I glimpsed on Harry\\'s face told me that this was the first time he was hearing this apparently unacceptable news. After he recovered from his initial confusion, the conversation carried on pretty ordinarily. From that day forward, though, Harry and I rarely talked.For a long time I blamed myself for Harry not liking me, but I was also mad at my parents. \\'Why couldn\\'t you two be normal?\\' I thought. \\'Why can\\'t I have a dad like everyone else?\\' I was thoroughly uncomfortable talking about my family. I loved my parents deeply, but any time the topic of dads came up, I avoided the conversation. If avoidance was impossible, I engaged in self-deprecating and sardonic humor, poking fun at my \\'abnormal\\' family. My experience with Harry could have taught me that true friends should support each other fully and unconditionally; instead, it planted in my mind the worry that there was something inherently wrong with my family. This harmful idea, which persisted through middle school, hindered my self-confidence and inhibited my personal development.This summer, while volunteering at a literacy camp, I encountered a situation reminiscent of my experience with Harry. A rising 3rd grader, Donald, asked me about my dad\\'s job. When I explained that I have two moms, Donald snorted, \\'Ew.\\' My heart sank. A confusing combination of shock, anger, and disappointment coursed through my veins. For a moment I was paralyzed. How could it be that in America, the most advanced nation in the world, an 8-year-old kid who can\\'t even read the word \\'homosexual\\' already has an ingrained repulsion toward gays and lesbians? I quickly regained my composure and began my impassioned rebuttal: \\'My mothers are upstanding citizens who are incredibly kind and do much good in the world!\\'My response may have meant little to the oblivious youngster, whose mind had undoubtedly moved on to more pressing issues, like lunch. Our conversation, however, did have a significant impact on me. It showed me that I\\'m proud of where I\\'ve come from. It reinforced my deeply held notion that a person\\'s character is comprised of far more than sexual orientation. It reminded me that our world still needs people willing to fight for universal acceptance and respect.It turns out that my Oedipus complex isn\\'t so complex after all: I don\\'t need to identify with a father to learn how to be moral. My mothers\\' examples have guided me all along. \"}, {\"index\": 807, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] One year ago on a Sunday morning, I packed a small blanket and The Joy Luck Club and looked for a pocket of the universe where I could have the voices of the book fill up the silence around me. Even though I am of Chinese heritage, I\\'ve always felt more American than Chinese and wanted to fill the void. Whereas most people learn about their culture from their home, family, and community, I learned about it from the half dozen books I read.Each author contributed a different insight on Chinese culture and customs present in his or her home. As I compared the stories to my own distinctly American experiences, I discovered how little I knew about my Chinese heritage. Although reading was the best way I knew how to access the unfamiliar life I was missing, it wasn\\'t enough. I wanted to experience Chinese culture first-hand.For a brief time, I tried to compensate for my naivety by adding Chinese Pop Music Artists, such as Jay Chou, into my mainstream music collection. I embarrassingly tried to rap in Chinese and was obsessed with watching Chinese movies. By listening to Chinese music and watching movies, I thought I understood Chinese culture. It wasn\\'t until I went to my grandfather\\'s funeral in Los Angeles when I realized I hadn\\'t gained any further insight into Chinese culture. The music and movies embodied an Asian aesthetic packaged for Western consumption.At my grandfather\\'s funeral, I was struck with a cultural shock wave. I smelled the subtle incense sticks the books described. I bowed when necessary and did what was expected. Through the hazy smoke from burning money, I could clearly see the beauty of the ancient rituals. As part of the ceremony, I held up three burning sticks and bowed toward a flaming bowl to pay my respects. Eulogies were spoken in Chinese, monks chanted Buddhist verses, and, although I didn\\'t understand, the intensity of the emotion captivated my attention. I had never been as aware of my heritage as in that moment. Although it was overwhelming being an outsider, I did not want to see my own cultural identity fade and become obscure just like how translated words lose their nuances.This funeral required the precision of language and movement in order for me to be accepted by the other Chinese mourners. My heavily English-accented Chinese speech and unmistakable western clothing style made the cultural differences even more apparent as I conversed with my relatives, some of whom were dressed in traditional Buddhist robes. Although my Californian tan gives the impression I come from a low class farming family in China, I was introduced and accepted by my father\\'s friends as \\'the girl from America\\'.Because my appearance marks me as Chinese, Chinese strangers and Americans expect me to know the Chinese traditions, language, and pop culture. This immediate assumption makes me insecure about my lack of complete cultural understanding, but I am proud because I found a lost part of myself from it. After my failed attempts at experiencing culture through media, I was able to finally recognize the differences between American and Chinese cultures. Though I haven\\'t read or experienced enough to call myself an expert in Chinese culture, as long as I can incorporate a xie-xie (thank you) into my vocabulary or admire the delicate strokes of Chinese calligraphy, the simplicity and the elegance is enough for me. By exploring the unknown, I have now come to the resolution that I\\'m Chinese-American and I will be forever bound to my cultures by the hyphen. \"}, {\"index\": 808, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I hear the familiar blending of the espresso machine, sputtering of whipped cream, thank-yous, footsteps, random chatter and laughter around me. In front of me is my empty coffee cup, half-finished research paper, articles peppered with highlighting, and post-it notes scattered around. As I take a break, a man asks me, \\'Hey, what are you working on?\\' I tell him about my topic on school funding issues in America, which launches us into an hour-long conversation about our education system. On another day, as I read my art history textbook, a young lady comments that her husband is an artist. We talk about art for half an hour; I can study for my quiz later, but this talk can\\'t wait.Although most people would find this environment distracting, I find it very suitable. I like talking to strangers, exchanging ideas -- it stimulates me. I find the experience of being engaged in a fascinating conversation more valuable than endless studying. When else might I be able to learn the correct pronunciation of Goethe, be taught Buddhist principles from an ex-monk, or debate wealth inequality gaps? All these deviations from my work provide rest for my mind while opening me up to think more, and think bigger.I love studying at my local Starbucks, away from complications at home where misunderstandings from language and cultural barriers frustrate me. Although I was born in Korea, I grasped English quickly and soon became adjusted to living here. However, for my mother, America was, and still is, a foreign country, a place she can never call home. Thus I had to grow up fast, pay bills on time, and focus my thoughts on practical matters. Home became a place where I had to take on the responsibilities of an adult. Additionally, as I became more fluent in English, my Korean faded. I preferred the company of others who spoke English to that of my mother. It was troubling to talk to her, because as broken as my Korean became, her English did not improve. By the time I was in middle school, I became accustomed to coming here on the late bus, settling down with a cup of coffee, and working. With this habit came new experiences. Not only did I reach that lifetime goal of being a \\'regular\\' somewhere, but I also developed confidence. From answering strangers\\' questions with one-word answers, I slowly started to look up more and ask back. I learned to become more comfortable starting conversations on my own and asking questions. Before I knew it, I also became more participatory in class, raising my hand often, talking to my classmates. After years of confining my thoughts to the boundaries of my head, I began to relish the opportunity to share. Talking to strangers, knowing that the chance of meeting them again would be slim, helped me become bolder while honing my conversational and speech skills. There\\'s a new word around called \\'sonder,\\' the realization that everyone around you is living a life as full, as miserable, as happy, as complex as you are. Meeting people from all walks of life helped me both to understand sonder and to apply it. I used to be bitter toward my mom. I blamed our language-barrier on her, thinking she wasn\\'t trying hard enough to learn the new language or adjust to the new culture. However, looking back, I see her bravery in coming to a new country to raise her children as admirable, and I find her struggles of being a single mom unimaginable. Ultimately, the pressures she exerted and sometimes harsh words were all for the best, because they motivated me to take advantage of the resources available and grow independently. Now, as I listen to the familiar daily sweeping of the floor (at exactly 9:45 PM), I feel sonder again as I pack up and head home to my mother. \"}, {\"index\": 809, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]                      Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea. What prompted you to act? Would you make the same decision again?     My shaking fingers closed around the shiny gold pieces of the saxophone in its case, leaving a streak of fingerprints down the newly cleaned exterior. The soft and melodic sound of a classic jazz ballad floated out of a set of speakers to my right, mixing with the confident chatter of students in the back row. As usual, I shuffled around in the back of the classroom, attempting to blend in with the sets of cubbies. With my confidence already fading, I sat and thought to myself, I wonder if it\\'s too late to drop this course? I heard Art Exploration still has plenty of openings!     The director stepped to the front of the room, and snapped his fingers in a slow rhythm that the drummer tapped out with his worn wooden sticks. The band congregated in the middle of the room, each person tapping his or her feet along with the drummer. Just relax! I scolded myself, just be jazzy and no one will notice you look out of place. I attempted to mimic the laid-back, grooving movements of my peers, but to no avail. My movements were about as far away from \\'jazzy\\' as one could possibly get. I was used to the rigid accents and staccatos of the concert band world.     As the solo section began to move around the room most students seemed relaxed and loose, acting as if they were easygoing musicians on a street corner in New Orleans. I felt my body tense and my eyes dart nervously around the room for a quick escape route.     My confidence plummeted as the person in front of me swung a closing riff and looked expectantly in my direction. I quickly pressed the mouthpiece to my tongue and played a few stiff sounding riffs, but the notes seemed to fall flat. I felt my face flush a nice shade of deep red as I stood in the middle of the room with the drummer tapping away, waiting for me to step in and finish.     All of a sudden, the director shouted, \\'Play a riff! Dance! Come on, Phoebe, at least do something!\\' His exasperated tone prompted me to attempt to salvage the bleak looking situation I was currently facing. I awkwardly shuffled my right toe on the ground, attempting to pass it off as a lame sort of jig that I assumed was probably groovy. However, the Director let out a long, dramatic sigh and stated, \\'Well, fair enough. I guess some people just can\\'t dance.\\'     Excuse me! I can dance, what is this man implying? My thoughts were moving as quickly as the beat from the drum set in the corner as I tried to process what the director had just told me. Listening to the background music, I attempted to loosen my body, starting with the tap-tap-tap of my toes. As I started to sway, I let the blues scale I knew so well float out of my instrument to match the soft, swelling tide of the music coming from the ensemble. I lost myself in the dance, imagining myself performing in a late-night jazz club. I swung my notes to the beat and moved around the room, as if I were John Coltrane. When my solo finished, I felt, dare I say, Groovy!     Precision and structure are ever-present in my life, whether I am rowing on Tempe Town Lake or applying my analytical mind to classroom work. However, now I approach life swaying to the flowing beats of a jazz song, dancing along with ease. Jazz has allowed me to be more spontaneous and enjoy moments as they come. It undoubtedly improved my musicianship, and I am more open minded in class discussions and more patient and flexible with my teammates during practice.The beat may quicken and change, but now I have the confidence to follow it and keep on dancing.           \"}, {\"index\": 810, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]         Tapping touch screen. Snoring. Turning page.        These were the noises of your typical New York subway during rush hour. Everyone was focused on reaching their destination on time. People were too engrossed with their own lives to acknowledge each other and their environment, even the acrid smell coming from the back corner of the train.        An unfortunate passenger was trying to sleep, but the woman sitting next to him made him uncomfortable with her obvious gestures of disgust. A scowl was pasted on her face along with a tissue covering her nose. The people sitting across weren\\'t helping either, as they too, were in no hurry to hide their revulsion from the man, who gently whistled to himself.         I observed the situation from a distant seat. I looked down at the plastic bag on my lap. Inside was a water bottle, napkins, a travel deodorant, toothpaste, a toothbrush, hand sanitizer, and several other items that we could purchase with our $80 budget. We called it a blessing bag. In each bag was a quote or saying signed by the Soldiers of Society.        This past year, a group of students and I were participating under the Research and Action division of the Muslim Interscholastic Tournament. We had to choose a problem within society and propose a solution for it. Our group chose to fight people\\'s misconceptions of homeless people. I confess, I was one of the biggest believers of these misconceptions. Two months ago, I would have been the passenger sitting across this man bluntly holding my nose. With this project, we were supposed to get out of our comfort zone. We had to approach homeless people, have a conversation with them to learn their stories, and give them a blessing bag. Initially, the other group members thought it was a stupid and risky idea; people can be dangerous. So we established a rule-- you must always be with a group.          However, at this moment, I was on my morning commute to school, alone. Deep inside, I still held some of stereotypes in my head. He\\'s whistling to himself. He must be insane.  \\'The next stop is Court Square.\\' the conductor  said.         I had about 10 minutes to approach this man and or sit absorbed in my own world like the rest of the passengers.           I read the slip of paper inside the bag. \\'\\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Where there is hardship, there is relief.\\' (Quran, 94:6) -Soldiers of Society\\'.           These were the words that had pushed me to overcome my parent\\'s fear of bigotry and wear the hijab, the words that had helped me get past my fear of public speaking and become a leader in the Muslim Student Association, the words that had motivated me to speak up and present my research on AIDS to the mob of professors, the words that encouraged me to teach science to strangers in a museum, the words that will later help pursue a difficult but doable path in the medical field, and use that knowledge to help the underprivileged all around the world. Now, these words pushed me to help this unfortunate man.          I slowly stood and began to walk towards the back corner of the train, where the man sat. Inside, my heartbeat sped up.         Where there is hardship...         I tapped the man\\'s shoulder and held out the bag with a smile on my face. The man looked up in surprise, but accepted it and thanked me. He squinted to read the slip of paper visible through the bag, \\'Where there is hardship, there is relief.\\'         The trance was broken. People began to look up from their phones and books to look at the back of the train. The woman who was scowling a second ago began to smile and even joined in our conversation about our favorite novels.  ...there is relief.  \"}, {\"index\": 811, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\\\u00a1Hola chicos! \\\\u00a1Vamos! \\\\u00bfQue tal? \\\\u00bfBien? Bueno chicos, primero vamos a empezar con este trabajo. \\\\u00bfSi? \\\\u00a1Bueno!So began my first class, in my new school, in my new country.As much as I&#39;d like to say my transition into school in Zurich was seamless, that is not the case. Having taken three years of Spanish in Seattle, I thought I knew enough, and was overconfident when I walked into class on the first day of school. A typical day of class consisted of speaking, reading, analyzing, and writing, all in Spanish. I was the only one in my &#39;beginning Spanish&#39; class who hadn&#39;t actually been speaking Spanish for as long as my three classmates. I struggled more than I ever had. I was not only just transitioning into a new Spanish class, but a new culture and all new classes, and it became extremely overwhelming.Every day, my British classmate would tease me for the way I pronounced words, or if I ever made a silly mistake. Eventually, he nicknamed me &quot;Idiota.&quot; When my teacher, Ms. Campo, asked me to describe myself in no less than fifteen sentences in Spanish, my face went bright red after attempting the task. I felt my eyes start to well up and I knew there was nothing I could do to stop my cheeks from flushing. My classmate was only seconds away from pointing at me and laughing, yet I knew that Ms. Campo would sit there and wait for me to finish, no matter how long it took. After a torturous ten minutes, filled with snickers and rude whispers, I was finally done. My heart pounding, I slowly composed myself trying not to burst into tears. It was the most uncomfortable I have ever felt. For the first time ever, I really did feel like an &quot;idiota.&quot; I just stopped speaking in class.I wasn&#39;t used to getting things wrong, especially in Spanish, but I wasn&#39;t really used to learning about and soaking in the culture either. Instead of only learning foreign words, we were cooking traditional Spanish empanadas, reading El Mundo, and watching El Orfanato. My experiences in class helped me realize that if I really wanted something, it would take some failure and some hard work, but it would definitely pay off. I learned to fully invest myself, to put my heart into a class and a subject in order to succeed. I no longer just float through a class.Having been back in Seattle for two years now, I am realizing how much this situation helped me grow. Instead of quietly sitting in the back of the classroom, I am now confident enough to present my chemistry project on Electronegativity and Electron Affinity to the entire school. Working one on one with my teacher, I can challenge his ideas and ask clarifying questions, and even share a laugh when I realize how silly my questions sound.As I leave my chemistry lab after a morning of making foam &#39;cupcakes&#39; and bright pink bouncy balls, my mind flashes back to Zurich. The credits are rolling after our favorite Spanish movie ends, and this time I understood all the words. Incre\\\\u00edble. \"}, {\"index\": 812, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Because there is good in every person, there is hope for every person: such has been my mantra for as long as I can remember, following me as I have matured, and I approach every situation by seeking out the best and then encouraging myself and others to let it shine. At New Hope Academy, an elementary school with a 50% minority constituency where many children go home to impoverished single-parent households, I channel this mentality into the students I tutor, encouraging themwith \\'you can, I promise.\\'However, my innate optimism left me last summer, when I started helping a group of Hispanic adults prepare for the GED. For this motley crew of underprivileged but passionate students, I was the assistant teacher to an elderly man, an expert in math but not in teaching. I wasn\\'t entirely comfortable as a sixteen-year old senior helping this grandfatherly figure teach people ten years older than I, but every Tuesday found me growing more attached. I was most drawn to Alma, a single mother whoworked two jobs to support her children but still came to our sessions for hours every Tuesday to try to create a better life for her family. Alma worked tirelessly in class, but she struggled to understand the head teacher\\'s explanations. Though she occasionally stumbled upon the correct answer, the teacher\\'s conflicting methods more often furthered her confusion, so I started sitting beside her to show her other solutions. One week, the teacher explained percentages in a way that left most of the class befuddled. I got up to whisper explanations to the adults but couldn\\'t clear up any of the problems. \\'Senorita!\\' Alma hissed across the room, and I walked back over to her to see her paper littered with notes in Spanish and incorrect answers. I began as usual, murmuring what I could without disruptingthe class, but after three different explanations she remained as lost as ever. As both of us became more frustrated, I searched for my usual words of encouragement only to find none. All I could think was that Alma might have no chance to succeed because college cost too much and her language would inevitably bar her and her children\\'s progress. Disconcerted, I whispered an apology to her and moved on to the next student.It only occurred to me when I got home that through the entire process of tutoring Alma and witnessing her persistence, I myself had failed her because I had failed to hope, losing the quality by which I defined myself. I spent the night in a daze, wondering where reality had turned into cynicism and logic into dismissal. As the night dragged on, I couldn\\'t believe that I, who had always wanted to be a teacher, had accepted Alma\\'s reality as a limit.In the end, my momentary loss of hope turned into a lesson I needed to learn: it\\'s okay to be world-weary at times, but never to use \\'reality\\' as a justification for giving up. Instead, we must couple optimism not with cynicism but with action. When I returned on Tuesday, I pulled the teacher aside and asked if I could take Alma out of class. We immediately plunged into percentages, spending two hours practicing problem after problem with uninterrupted questions and explanations. When we finally closed the book, I was exhausted and my brain was reeling, but looking over to Alma I saw only a smile. \\'You\\'re a good teacher,\\' she said. \\'Today I learn this because of you.\\'As Alma and I get closer to her GED test, our work together reaffirms what I have always believed: as cheesy as it sounds, there is hope for every person no matter the odds. When Alma goes in to take her test, I have faith she will believe that, too. \"}, {\"index\": 813, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Sometimes squeezing my jaw tightly shut and holding onto my cheek was the only way to bear the pain without pain killers. I understood that we couldn&#39;t afford to go to the dentist, but having those relentless moments of excruciating pain become a normal part of my life was difficult to get used to. I remember being grateful for the times when my nerves went dormant, but those were always temporary. It wasn&#39;t until this past April that, after two tooth extractions and two root canals, those moments ended permanently. My mom was just getting out of the hospital after six months of misery; she finally decided to accept Medi-cal and food stamps benefits. Something was wrong with her liver. The doctors never figured out why she wasn&#39;t getting better, but after dropping forty pounds and losing all her hair, the sickness gradually subsided. Although she doesn&#39;t admit that being an alcoholic caused it, she still quit drinking. During one of my visits, she broke down in front of me, saying that she felt like a failure as a parent. I tried to tell her that everything was okay and not to worry about us, but the truth was I was struggling. My older brothers were already in college and my younger sister was living with our grandma, but I was alone. After the divorce, my mom was ready to be single, but not a single mom. While she worked travel assignments and partied with her friends, my siblings and I looked after each other. Regardless of our constant evictions, we always had a roof over our heads. All of that changed Junior year. Growing up, we constantly rented one house after the next: totaling thirteen houses and six different schools before freshman year. Though we still moved, I did everything in my power to keep myself at Hemet High. I couldn\\'t lose my close-knit group of friends, not this time. Once school started, I established a routine that consisted of: getting my sister and self ready for school and making sure we both finished our homework, took showers and were fed before bedtime. My grandma gave us rides. A few months later, she would be doing everything in her power to help my mom keep the house, but the eviction notice came too quickly. It took just one weekend to pack my bags and move everything in the house to storage. Meanwhile, the doctors still had no answers to my mom\\'s condition. I couldn\\'t stay with my grandma because her mobile home park only allowed elderly to live there. Thankfully, though, she managed to keep my sister a secret. From there, every house was just a temporary home. Constantly transitioning from guest beds, floors and couches replaced my perception of a bedroom.The house I stayed at the most was my paternal grandma\\'s house. My friend gave me rides to school; after volleyball I went with my grandma to help her with her third job, not arriving home until ten every night. I never considered living with my father until he moved in, bringing my stepmom and their three children with him. She was addicted to methamphetamine and they always fought. Whenever I stayed with them, I always ended up babysitting. Soon enough the house was home to thirteen people with tensions constantly boiling. When they finally rented another house, I followed. Over spring break, I went on a college road trip with some friends. Upon our return, my stepmom didn\\'t let me in the house because she was trying to kick my dad out. I spent the next few days at my best friends house, which is actually where I\\\\\\\\\\\\u2018m living right now. They wanted me to have a stable place to call home in my final year of high school. It\\'s difficult for me to express how thankful I am for this; they\\'re just very genuine people, with hearts of gold.Despite this rollercoaster of a life, I\\'ve never lost sight of what\\'s important: my education and the well-being of my siblings. Because of my experiences, I know that getting an education is the only way out of this type of life. But I\\\\\\\\\\\\u2018m not just doing this for me. I\\\\\\\\\\\\u2018m doing it for them too, my energetic and beautiful younger siblings (today there are five). I owe it to them to be the best big brother I can be not only because my older brothers were there to keep me focused, but because they don\\'t deserve this instability. One day, I hope to inspire them to do great things, just like they inspire me every minute of every day. The most important piece of advice I can offer them is \\'We can\\'t control where we come from, but we can control where we go from there.\\' \"}, {\"index\": 814, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] It doesn\\'t have an address and it can\\'t be found on a map. It\\'s a place where \\'impossible\\' doesn\\'t exist, where dreams exist as reality, where just for a second everything exists in a state of perfection. It is whatever I want it to be. It is the lush Guatemalan jungle where the monumental Mayan ruins rest. It is the inside of an operating room where I am saving a baby with the potential to change the world. It is the warm embrace of my aunt that I will never feel again but miss every day. It\\'s my safe haven devoid of obstacles, hate, and hostility where the possibilities extend forever, but most importantly, it\\'s the place I met Sarah.My imagination first introduced me to this extraordinary eleven year old while I was volunteering at the University of California, Davis MIND Institute (Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders). I\\'ve never actually met \\'Sarah,\\' but instead read a random name off of a vial of blood. Sarah, like many people at the institute, has autism. Chances are that she will need to be supported, at least to some degree, for the rest of her life and she will meet obstacles at every turn.In my mind though, I have created a home for Sarah. It\\'s a place where she and I can just exist in each other\\'s presence and live somewhere where we aren\\'t defined or judged for who we are. It has become the place I escape to when the world seems impossibly grim and lifeless, for she is waiting for me. She is my grounding force, my beacon of hope, my best friend and with her I can be myself. I can blast the music and sing with her, I can eat an entire tub of ice cream with her, I can cry when I feel lost and alone and I can do it all without feeling judged.In my mind, Sarah gets to experience this same freedom, but every day I experience a sense of hollow pain knowing that her real life is probably much different than this. I want to be able to live in this world with her forever, but I know I can\\'t. Every day, I am forced back to reality against my will. The realization that such a world as this exists though, even if only in my head, has made me realize that such a world is possible. Sarah and this beautiful place have shaped who I am in my soul, what kind of impact I want to impart on this world, and the kind of person I hope to see in the mirror one day.My dream, as a result of my experiences in my mind, focuses on transporting my personal world out of my imagination and into reality. \\'Meeting\\' Sarah and being in her presence has opened my eyes to autism and my heart to the people living with autism. I want to help transform this world into a safe haven for me, for Sarah, for them. I know I can\\'t change the whole world, but I can change Sarah\\'s world and the world of every other person living with autism. That I know I can do because I have seen it, touched it, and experienced it in my mind.Within the boundaries of my mind is a place that knows no limits. It\\'s whatever I want it to be. It is the volleyball court that has become my second home. It is the world I hope to experience one day. It is me discovering the cure for Sarah\\'s disorder. My mind doesn\\'t have an address and it can\\'t be found on a map but that doesn\\'t make it any less real. It is as real as anything else in this world and it will break any last boundaries to transcend the confines of my mind and break through into reality. \"}, {\"index\": 815, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] A single spotlight lit the stage as I stood front and center in a three-tiered theater with the audience cloaked in darkness. I sanguinely placed my foot on the stage\\'s black rubber floor and stepped into a graceful arabesque. The music began to roar and a surge of vigor erupted as my feet defied gravity. My arms pierced the air in perfect unison as I turned twice, then three times in a perfect pirouette.The music prematurely went silent as the theater metamorphosed back into my mundane living room and I awoke from my daydream. There I was, rehearsing my old Pizzicato solo routine on the hardwood floor. I wore not a white tutu with a delicate black lace overlay, but my basic blue pajamas. \\'Will I always have ballet?\\' I asked myself, thinking back to my decision to give up dance freshman year in order to focus my full attention on Brooklyn Technical High School\\'s Gateway to Medicine Program. I was thrilled to be in a rigorous program that would help me pursue my dream of becoming a cardiothoracic surgeon, but dance had always been a part of my life. So that night in my living room, I signed up to audition for the Alvin Ailey Summer Intensive Dance Program. In the audition when my number \\'206\\' was called to the stage, I questioned whether or not dance was still a relevant part of my journey. My performance in the audition lacked confidence, and I was not offered the opportunity. The next day, I went to school and saw my name on the \\'Top Ten\\' list. It carried a new meaning after the audition, reminding me to gain back the confidence and perseverance in pursuing multiple ambitions at the same time. As school helped me grow more passionate about becoming a physician, I began to experience the presence of ballet even without rehearsals or classes. In geometry, I considered the geometrical patterns a dancer creates through her transitions, while in biology I studied how adrenaline enters my bloodstream when I wait behind the curtains in anticipation of a performance.           For years, ballet has taught me to aim for precision, to respect the human body, and to be confident. A dancer must always calculate the appropriate amount of force necessary to complete a certain turn, or be aware of how her weight shifts in order to maintain balance. Finally, ballet has taught me to not limit myself, but rather to use creativity and imagination to explore possibilities.           The results of the Alvin Ailey audition could have signified failure and solidified my shift away from ballet. Not only have I successfully welcomed dance back into my life as a new member of the Mark Morris Dance Company, but also I have done so with the intent of using it to help prepare me for my future as a physician.Now, almost a year later, I rush to the Mark Morris Dance School. As I stand in the hallway securing my bun in place, I watch through the glass as an older woman leaps across the room, exuberating poise and vitality in grand allegro. At the end of class, she quickly gathers her bags and scurries off. Perhaps she\\'s off to another class, or maybe she\\'s off to finish her cardiovascular consultations at New York Presbyterian Hospital. But as she walks away, I understand that my relationship with dance is more than physical. It is mental and can be strengthened at any point in my life. I recognize that my art has value in my present and will positively affect my future. I can use tools obtained through dance such as discipline, compassion, patience, and precision, to become a skilled physician. Lastly, I can now answer my aforementioned question with enthusiasm because of my newfound sense of clarity: I will, indeed, always have ballet. \"}, {\"index\": 816, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 817, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 818, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Getting dressed each morning for school, I slip on my blazer, tighten my leather Oxfords, and pick a pair of glasses that match my outfit. Just a block away from my house, my town\\'s high school is a two-minute walk to my left. However, I turn right and begin my hour-long commute to St. Peter\\'s Prep. On my way to the bus stop, I always run into my childhood friends as we go in different directions. I wonder, \\'Why is my life so different from theirs? Do they think I\\'m pretentious, going to a prep school?\\' I don\\'t live in a dystopian town where gunshots go off every day. However, many of my friends just don\\'t care about school and use alcohol, drugs or sex to escape from their socioeconomic realities; the majority of my town is low-income and Latino.I continue walking to the bus stop and run into a friend who went to my elementary school. \\'Those red pants make you look like one of those jerks from Prep, bruh. I work the register at a bank and I don\\'t even wear that crap,\\' he says while laughing in a sincere manner. He shakes my hand the same way we have since the second grade; we both smile at the fact that the gesture is alive after all these years.Arriving at my high school, my favorite priest sketches the trinity on my torso and mentions something he wants me to do with the blessing of God that day: ace a test, inspire the freshmen with a motivational speech or simply be happy. Feeling loved, I move on to ethics class and analyze how the cycle of socialization comes into play with the same community I just tutored a weekend ago, Brooklyn Jesuit Prep. In my science class, I discuss how global warming relates to the research trip I recently attended in Alaska with my teacher.To enjoy the weekend, I go to a football game between Prep and my neighborhood. During a play, my prep friends chant, \\'That\\'s alright, that\\'s okay, you\\'ll be working for us someday.\\' Having deep bonds of friendship on both sides, I\\'m shocked at the thoughtlessness of my classmates. Part of me feels ostracized, but another part of me wants to fix things; I fiercely lecture them on how wrong they are about my home. With my neighborhood friends, part of me wants to ignore what the football fans had to say, but a subtle fear that they may be right grows in my heart. I am moved and start tutoring my neighborhood friends with my used test-preparation books and showing them the social skills I learned from Dale Carnegie. I also start sharing books on body language and charisma, fascinating guides to lucid dreaming, and my favorite thrillers from Stephen King. I do this simply because it\\'s what friends do. While I see college as an opportunity, many of my neighborhood friends see it as an obstacle keeping them from a paying job. I am trying to help this handful of friends realize that studying, reading, and learning can be rewarding.Living two blocks away from me, my best friend, Eduardo, attends public school and wants to become a United States Marshal. Working out four hours every day and taking classes like public speaking, law and American literature, everything he does revolves around his goal. People like Eduardo give me hope among the football fans\\' chanting and make the fear in my heart subside.The two worlds that comprise my being constantly play tug of war in my mind. My parents came from poverty in Ecuador, so I was raised believing that hard work and education can take you anywhere. Whether that work is in the classroom, at the gym or networking at a business event, persistence is what fosters success. Not your race. Not your native language. Not your ZIP code. \"}, {\"index\": 819, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Saturday night was movie night. Every week my family would huddle around the television to watch the latest movie my dad had rented from Blockbuster. The next morning, I\\'d stand up on my timeout stool and riddle off line after line from the previous night\\'s film. I remember both the shock and the delight etched on the faces of my family members, a four-year old reenacting scenes from a movie he had never seen before. In these moments, I felt as if I were lifted out of my wiry frame, my shrill voice commanding the same attention that Harrison Ford or Al Pacino had done the previous night. For the first time in my life, I realized that the words I spoke could make me feel bigger than my size. Over time, I learned to replace the words written by others with those I could call my own. Like lyrics from a catchy song, they came naturally to me. I remember the anxiety I felt at the prospect of my first speech, ten minutes in front of my friends and family. At the moderator\\'s invitation, I walked up to the podium at the front of the room. I looked down at my page and realized that my hands, clammy and cold, had smudged out the majority of my notes. I was alone. I took a long, deep breath and, as I opened my mouth to speak, an unexpected calm washed over me. My first words were crisp and my delivery was smooth, the words rolling off my tongue as if I had delivered the same argument hundreds of times before. Within what felt like seconds, I was delivering the closing remarks to my first ever debate. Standing on that stage, I realized that I had found a place where I felt comfortable. I think I\\'m like this because of my grandmother and namesake, Nur. She lived in Kenya her entire life, in a society where women were expected to stay at home, to be seen but not to be heard. People heard my grandmother. I\\'m told she was always the center of attention, her laughter and her spirit contagious as she fed off the energy from the people around her. Today I carry only her memory \\\\u2013 my grandmother succumbed to breast cancer a few years after I was born - but, oddly enough, she\\'s often the person in my family that I feel closest to. Initially, when the thought of a public speech sent me into panic, the image of my poised, gregarious grandmother was my source of confidence. I have to be good at public speaking, I reasoned, because it\\'s engrained in my DNA. I\\'m often asked if I still get nervous before speaking in front of a crowd. The truth is that I do; the dreaded butterflies make their presence felt in the moments leading up to every speech. But with time, as I\\'ve grown from my experiences and aligned myself with the causes I\\'m passionate about, I find that nerves alone are seldom enough to faze me. Said differently, public speaking has given me confidence. It taught me how to articulate my thoughts on complex issues, and how to build consensus in a group of people. It gave me the courage to run for President of my Junior Achievement company, the poise to deliver an impassioned speech to become a student leader at Upper Canada College, the credibility to mediate inter-company conflict at Micro Africa and the charisma to rally Canadian youth in support of the Canadian Student Microfinance Alliance.Fourteen years have passed from my days recounting the lines of famous movie stars. Thankfully, my voice has deepened and my frame has grown. Though I seldom encounter a timeout stool for support, I know better than to get worried - I\\'m confident that I\\'ll be heard loud and clear regardless. \"}, {\"index\": 820, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] My second name is \\'Ate.\\' No, it is not the past tense of eat.

It\\'s more than just a three-letter title. It is a challenging, but rewarding, full time job.I stood in front of my student council as we discussed how we were going to execute a successful homecoming week. All eyes were on me. All ears were open. All nodded in understanding as I dictated the game plan. As my eyes scanned the room, making eye contact with every person at least once, I couldn\\'t help but think of two little girls that have always looked up to me, not just literally.\\'As usual, you have to finish your homework by 5:15 p.m. and then meet me here for dinner set-up okay? I\\'ll be in my room if you need help with homework\\'. I stuck my hand out. My sisters and I have always had this cheesy handshake, which we\\'ve always done before we separated to our respective work areas. Only a couple minutes had elapsed before Theriz called for help with homework. I had to be understanding and patient because she was just learning the basics of mathematics. A few minutes later, I heard Trixie call out, \\'Ate\\'. She broke me out of my trance at my desk and I went to go help her. She had her head down and exasperatedly complained, \\'I hate my group!\\' I advised her to try her best to distribute the work based on the strengths of her classmates and then I gave her a comforting hug and whispered encouraging words.I smile at the thought of my sisters and continue, \\'I will explain the past school traditions to the freshmen in the council.\\' \\'Who here is good at aesthetics?\\' I ask my team. \\'You will be in charge of decor.\\'\\'No one is buying tickets for the dance; we can and will raise the sales if we just keep at it!\\' I insist. \\'We only have-\\'\\'I chose every single one of you to be here because I believe in your capabilities.\\' I declare. We only had days to plan everything. And we pulled through. I felt moved that my words can stir an empowering emotion in others. It brings me great joy to look back and see how much my sisters have grown and how I have had the honor  to take part in raising them. The \\'Ate\\' works 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Not only do I learn more about my sisters every day, but I also learn more and get a deeper understanding of who I am. Throughout the years, my sisters have taught me invaluable lessons and skills that have helped me to gain my current position as the school president. \"}, {\"index\": 821, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I have always loved looking at the components of objects and trying to figure out the mechanisms that allow them to function. I used to take apart devices around the house and put them back together for fun. Trying to figure mechanisms applied not only to machines, but also to living things. Sometimes, I find myself losing focus during lunch and end up staring at that pair of muscles at the corners of my friend\\'s forehead that constantly contract and release as he chews. That may seem a little creepy, but it is representative of my fascination with muscles as mechanical structures. I long to learn how to combine both machinery and biology in robotics through a technique called biomimicry. To do so, I must have an understanding of how to design machinery and account for the different for different environmental. I\\'m particularly interested in those biological structures found in aquatic life such as seals, fish, and squid; thus, I need a good understanding of fluid thermodynamics. Therefore, I want to attend a mechanical engineering program with a strong emphasis in fluid thermodynamics such as that at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. Over the summer, I participated in the AP/EA program through Summer Programs for Diversity. One of the courses I took was 33106: Physics I for Engineering Students under Dr. Kunal Ghosh. I had never taken a physics course before, so I didn\\'t know quite what to expect. I knew only that physics was essential for engineering. Throughout the course, I fell in love with physics. I consider myself a spatial/kinesthetic thinker, and physics brought that to a whole new level. I feel that, unlike other disciplines, physics is not about learning a bunch of random facts; learning physics is like learning a new way to think. After completing the course, I continued on to take Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism. Whereas 33106 was more spatial and readily visible, this class was much more theoretical, experimental, and smaller in scale. Regardless, I am totally enamored by the subject. Attending that class is the highlight of my day. What can I say? My heart is in the work. This is why I\\'d like to major in physics. I am interested in Civil Engineering for similar reasons as stated in my first paragraph. One thing I excluded was my interest in the human impact on the environment. I have spent most of my high school career involved in the maintenance of the Miami coastline under the guidance of my Marine Science teacher, Martin Roch. I believe that environmental impact is an important element to consider in engineering. Since CIT\\'s environmental engineering program is combined with its Civil Engineering program, I listed Civil Engineering as a potential major.Although up to this point I have focused nearly exclusively on my STEM interests, I hold love for a variety of subjects in the arts. I am a bass singer. I have long wanted to learn hip-hop dance. I recently have been considering learning to play trombone. Aside from CMU\\'s strong programs in engineering, I am applying to CMU because it is a university with a strong emphasis on both the sciences and the arts, and the interaction between the two. During my last visit, I saw engineers, political scientists, and performance artists alike dancing in BLUR. I laughed with my MechE, Art, Trumpet, and Physics major friends at the Underground. I treasure this intermingling. The ability to participate in the arts, while still receiving a strong STEM education is what draws me to Carnegie Mellon University. \"}, {\"index\": 822, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'You can make it on your own, right?\\' the voice on the other end said in an irritatingly casual tone.Well I don\\'t really have a choice, I thought.\\'Oh yeah, I\\'ll be fine,\\' I responded, in a very passive aggressive tone.Fantastic.I hung up and looked out at the busy street. In two hours, I had to get food, go to a store near Grand Central Station to buy knee pads, and then get back to Marymount. I began to panic.But after minutes of freaking out, I realized that it was up to me myself from 17th Street to 42nd Street and then to 71st Street because time was not standing still. I had been living and dancing for a few days as part of choreographer Jennifer Archibald\\'s summer dance intensive in New York City. Most of my time was spend at Marymount Manhattan College, but I also had to attend seminars at New York University\\'s Medical Center and mock auditions at New York Live Arts. Every day, my mom was my guide, meeting me at each location and taking me to the next; however, this time I was my own guide. I knew that I just had to go. I sucked in a huge breath and told myself that I had to become a New Yorker.The Big Apple is completely different from my small southern city, but since I had been there several times before, I already had a sense of how it works. I have been for college visits, for Christmas, and with my school over Winter Break. I have seen Broadway productions, the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, and even watched New York City Ballet from the highest balcony. Since I had seen New Yorkers in action so many times before, it was not too difficult to channel their energy. With my head angled down, headphones blaring music that I was not really listening to, Greenwich Village worthy attire, and a new found quick pace, I made my way to the subway station.As I pushed my way through the sticky subway station, I remembered telling my mom on my first trip to the city that I felt like an ant. Instead of being with my own little colony, I was a lone ant in a maze full of others darting to their trains.After making it to Grand Central, buying some seriously unattractive knee pads, and returning to get on my next train, I realized that I had made it this far on my own. While this epiphany I was having could be broken down into me being able to read a map, I felt like I was on top of the world. At that moment, I knew that I had just taken an important step in my transition to adulthood. I had gone from relying on my mom to relying on myself. I plunged into the city and emerged a new woman.With a greater sense of confidence, I got onto another train and made it to Marymount. After being led around by my mom for seventeen years, I made it by myself from 17th Street to 71st Street. I felt as if I had just soared through the city and abandoned my childhood along the way. I felt empowered, as if nothing in the world could knock me down. Even though I will not legally be an adult for a few more months, my journey through the concrete jungle has already marked the beginning of my transition into adulthood. \"}, {\"index\": 823, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] An Unlikely Marriage\\\\u2028 I encountered the first book I ever loved when I was five years old: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone. My dad read to me at night, using a gravelly voice for Hagrid, a British accent for Harry, and a soft, feathery voice for Dumbledore. I remember lying in my bed transfixed in the fictional land.\\\\u2028 This adoration of reading that I developed on those nights followed me into school. Whenever teachers asked my favorite subject, images of my dad\\'s infectious happiness as we read together filled my thoughts, and I immediately answered \\'English\\'. In high school, my love for the written word only grew; I excelled in English courses, wrote countless articles for the school newspaper, and devoured the same compulsory books that killed my peers\\' joy of reading.  I was blissfully one-dimensional.\\\\u2028 In a profound paradox that supports the concept of opposites attracting my mother is, and always has been, a science fanatic. She\\'d prefer to dissect a frog than a work of literature, or discuss the logistics of a problem instead of its irony. On the nights when my dad and I read upstairs, my mom studied for her Nursing Degree surrounded by a ring of science textbooks-- all open to pages of boldfaced medical jargon and detailed anatomical drawings. With striking passion in her eyes she would show me the pictures, explaining how the frontal lobe controls cognition and the prefrontal cortex moderates social behavior. Her explanation, or perhaps the fervor with which she spoke, momentarily intrigued me. Though I was unaware at the time, the seed of a new interest had been planted. \\\\u2028  When I was eight years old, my parents divorced. The two most influential and important people in my life did not fit together; they were pieces of two different puzzles.\\\\u2028  Until sophomore year I only wanted to be a writer. I showed my dad everything I wrote and he would read and critique aloud. To me, that was our collective bond-- an unswerving dedication to language. I desired its significant presence in my life because it was the connection to him that I feared would break.\\\\u2028  Despite my deep-seated preference for English classes, junior year I found myself in Advanced Placement Chemistry. To this day I am unsure of what caused me to enroll, but much to my surprise I fell in love. We solved problems, derived formulas, and conducted laboratory research. The only plots we discussed were scatterplots. There was no zeugma or hyperbole-- only hyperbolas, in the few instances where quadratics made an appearance-- in our windowless classroom full of Bunsen burners, test tubes, and, of course, highly corrosive chemicals. \\\\u2028  As my dedication to Chemistry grew, my mom encouraged me to consider pursuing it after high school. She was thrilled that my initial indifference to science was now a blossoming interest. \\\\u2028  For several years I struggled to find balance between my parents-- fearing that my two separate lives would not mesh. Not until recently did I come to realize that just because a pair is unlikely doesn\\'t necessarily mean they repel each other. My dad read me books every night and taught me the beauty of language and storytelling. My mom opened my eyes to reason and science, and encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone to try something new. \\\\u2028  Each parent ignited a different spark, and so today I love each of these subjects equally. The marriage of English and chemistry is an unlikely one, but my passion for both subjects will intertwine the two disciplines into a valuable result. When I tell people that I want to double major in these seemingly disjointed fields, responses are unanimously hesitant, questioning, or outright pessimistic. To these people, I answer that I am not constructing the puzzle with preexisting pieces that do not appear to fit together; I am recreating the entire thing myself. \\\\u2028 \"}, {\"index\": 824, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] At a mighty 5\\'0\\' and 95 lbs, I am not my school\\'s next aspiring weightlifting champion.

I hated always fearing going outside our room, hated following all their rules, like not being allowed to turn on the lights to the long, scary hallway to reach our room, and hated being reminded every single day, in every single simple task, that we were in their debt forever.Because my mom couldn\\'t drive or understand English, didn\\'t know the culture or anything about how life in America worked, she had to depend on my aunt on many things - registering us for school, getting groceries, driving us everywhere. To this day, I miss being able to simply walk down from our apartment in Hong Kong to our lively neighborhood stores and buy whatever I wanted, when I wanted, rather than having to beg someone just to drive us to Albertsons for a loaf of bread. I miss the Chinese bakery, each roll of bread a fragrant artwork. I miss the vegetable and butcher stands where everyone knew each other by name and the bokchoy lady saved us the freshest bunch. Mostly, I miss all our local Chinese restaurants - the tofu, roast duck, and dimsum I had previously took for granted as easily accessible. And at every turn we were reminded of the burden we created, and the generosity bestowed upon us. I hated hearing it - but there was no denying the truth. From then on I wished to be no one\\'s burden.Things got better once my mom learned to drive and speak some English. But even in our eventual \\'own\\' house that wasn\\'t even legally our own, my mom relied on my uncle for \\'manly\\' help - sawing wood, installing sprinklers, fixing pipes. I hated that too but felt completely helpless. I learned to use screwdrivers and hammers and tried fixing things; however, there was only so much I could do.We were managing - until my dad became diagnosed with lung cancer. I was in second grade. My world turned upside down as my mom left for weeks at a time to care for him through his surgery and chemotherapy. My brother and I remained once again in the care of my relatives. Sharing a similar fear of being dependents, we conspired to cook for ourselves, aided by a rice cooker and half-accurate memories of my mom\\'s cooking, resulting in semi-raw ribs and flavorless blanched greens. We reveled in every bite, however, as they were completely our own.Life went on, even after my dad\\'s passing. Several times a year, we would tag along my uncle\\'s grocery trips from the Asian market, returning home laden with a refrigerator\\'s worth of food, plus fifty-pound bags of rice. And so it was that day - I was in sixth or seventh grade - my mom\\'s back was hurting, and she was debating asking my uncle to help move the bags. In the spur of a moment, I gritted my teeth, braced my back, and silently carried them myself. Albeit a simple gesture, it was also a monumental, definitive step in me taking charge of my family. It was then that I truly resolved to not simply stand there a helpless child, but rather take initiative, as an adult.It was heavy, but I lifted it. \"}, {\"index\": 825, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The tail emerged first, catching my eye. The ewe\\'s heaving chest indicated an abnormal birth. \\'Breech,\\' I said to my eight-year-old self. I recalled my dad using the term, but in the heat of the situation, my memory failed me. I grabbed a pair of rubber gloves and worked purely on instinct. Reaching for its rear legs, I pulled the fetlocks forward with the precision of a surgeon. The umbilical cord tugged, then broke. Gasping, the newborn struggled to break through the amniotic sac, and I knew that the lamb was either going to die of asphyxiation or drown in its own fluids. Ripping off the sac, I began pumping the lamb\\'s chest like a medic. After lying unresponsive for twenty painful seconds, the lamb sucked a breath. This near-death experience only helped to spark my biggest passion in life: agriculture.Growing up on a small eighty-acre farm in Anytown, South Dakota, I\\'ve long been defined by agriculture. My Christmases were spent delivering lambs, my Valentine\\'s Days were spent vaccinating lambs, and my Easters were spent selling lambs. I played a fundamental role on our farm, whether my contribution came in the form of throwing bales until my lungs were filled with hay dust or finding a way to prevent escape from the chicken coop. I learned to value hard work, honesty, and integrity; how to regroup when a crop fails or a flock dies; and how to act as a producer who affects positive change all over the world.Soon after I joined my school\\'s FFA Chapter, my family\\'s flock of sheep suffered an outbreak of coccidiosis due to tainted feed. To aid, I researched sustainable farming and in doing so, discovered a passion for public speaking. As a freshman, I won both the individual and team divisions of the State FFA Agricultural Communications Career Development Event then captured a gold medal at the National FFA Convention in Indianapolis, Indiana. As a sophomore, I furthered my FFA Career Development research. By the year 2050, the world will need 100% more food than we produce now. I evaluated the effectiveness of organic crops versus genetically modified crops on different plots of my family\\'s land. Using the results, I developed an algorithm for the fertilization of crops. Junior year brought more national speaking experience in the form of a gold medal performance in Louisville, Kentucky, at the Agricultural Issues Career Development Event. With national experience under my belt, I launched my own public speaking business that now boasts over thirty clients, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the South Dakota Soybean Council, and the South Dakota Department of Agriculture.Today my role on the farm merges the disciplines of economics, biology, and law.  I study market trends and am in the process of developing an algorithm to help my father predict soybean yields, all while still pulling lambs and throwing bales. Currently interning at a law firm, I combine my skills in agriculture, writing, and speaking to work on settling probate, estate, and corporate agricultural cases.I plan to pursue a degree in agricultural business with the goal of publishing undergraduate research on sustainable farming. I hope to pair my love for agriculture with my passion for public speaking to obtain a law degree and practice agricultural law. In his seminal book on natural farming, The One-Straw Revolution, Masanobu Fukuoka, renowned Japanese farmer and philosopher, wrote: \\'The ultimate goal of farming is not the growing of crops, but the cultivation and perfection of human beings.\\' Fukuoka\\'s proclamation, coupled with my experiences on the national stage in the National FFA Organization, drive me to advocate for agriculture and for the common good and cultivation of people all over the world\\\\u2014 a world in need of agriculture now more than ever. As a farmer, I have fed the world. As a speaker, I have educated the world. Defined by these practices, I will change the world. \"}, {\"index\": 826, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  For the longest time there were two people waking up in my bed each morning, and neither one of them knew who I was. One boy dedicated his time to observe the remains of an assassin bug, a hugely impactful predator with a name fit for its voracious nature. The other boy spent his early mornings reading the newspaper. A devastating cyclone had just hit the people of Burma, a thuggish ruling junta was causing havoc in their lives, and the young boy had to know about it. Although the two boys didn\\'t fully understand the implications of a loss of a particular species in a food web or restrictive trade policies on poor countries without much arable land, they still yearned for more knowledge.  Who was I? A future lab scientist, or the next President to come out of the state of California? Early on, my mother could see this dichotomy developing within my own personality. I got many puzzled looks when I asked for a subscription to TIME magazine along with a microscope kit for my tenth birthday. My career ambitions would seesaw between an astronaut and world traveler. The two Andrews would battle for a supermajority of the hours in each day until I decided to be the critical vote to swing towards one Andrew or the other. These halves behaved like two brothers; a modern day Cain and Abel with my punishment seemingly being eternal self-damnation.    Approaching adolescence, the two Andrews would fight for relevance in my mind. One, an active soccer defender, would yell war cries in the middle of his soccer match in a not-so-well thought out attempt at intimidation. The other knew his way around a World Book encyclopedia set, even at the expense of social crucifixion. Stevie Wonder was blasting from speakers as I studied the origins of Greek Democracy. Hardly anyone my age paid attention to news that didn\\'t make headlines. I\\'d be their CNN, a young Wolf Blitzer, analyzing a multifaceted humanitarian crisis although with little knowledge of historical context. I struggled immensely with the thought of my future. The conclusion drawn from those explanations was simple: the two Andrews had no place together.  After several years of intense self-reflection, I realized college would be the platform where I could passionately grow and find out who I want to be in this world. I could go to a school that has some of the world\\'s best professors and challenging courses that push me to consider every side of a complex issue. I can picture myself starting the day studying the decay patterns of radioactive elements and finishing the day by debating the success of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty. Whether I end up working for a private energy corporation or the U.S. State Department, I know at this very moment that this is what I needed all along. I needed an avenue to continue to grow in both of my fields of interest. I would not be limited to one half of my heart. My two Andrews, it turns out, were not mutually exclusive, but rather dependent on one another. \"}, {\"index\": 827, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Who am I? I am curious. Innovative. Self-motivated. And yes, nerdy. Each of these elements flows in my blood, head to toe. I can\\'t deny them nor am I ashamed by them. Heck, I couldn\\'t even imagine life without them because, starting from an early age, they are what have made me.Everyone has had a certain toy or object they obsessed over as a kid. Mine was my dad\\'s briefcase. Inside was a clutter of spare electric wire, old motors, and electrical tape. It may have seemed like a heap of junk to some people, but to me it was a treasure chest. Every time he whipped his briefcase out of the closet, he always engaged in something innovative from wiring the home theater system to powering his own remote-controlled racing boats, and I was always inspired by it. In fact, I can recall a few times that I snuck the case out of my dad\\'s closet just to see the magic inside. While I had no idea what any of the pieces meant, I was moved by curiosity, and I wanted to explore and create just like my dad did.   At the age of eleven, I was gifted a small engineering kit upon which my parents let me loose. Quickly, I became obsessed with it day and night, often locking myself in my laboratory to keep from outside distractions. After reading through the instruction manual cover to cover, I learned all the nifty tricks behind simple circuits and became capable of successfully powering light bulbs and small motors with a few spare batteries. Completing circuits became my forte, and I began to explore other areas to apply my new knowledge. My first groundbreaking project was assembling a hand-held fan to escape the outrageous Texas heat. Using the tactics from the kit, I took apart an old flashlight, inserted a small motor with a propeller powered by some size D batteries, and voila, with the flick of a switch, I had a homemade device to release me from the scorching flames of the season. As I grew older, I continued to be presented with instances to learn by trial and error. I can remember a time when my parents bought me a new Nerf Gun for Christmas when I was in 7th grade. Motivated by curiosity, it only took a few days until I had the gun in pieces, examining every aspect of it. After a few hours, I learned about how the compression of the main spring affected the strength of the gun, and so by increasing the compression, I increased the speed that the air chamber closed when pulling the trigger. All of a sudden, the Nerf bullets began to shoot at higher velocities. With this modification, wars with my brothers became a lot more fun, and often our battles ended with who had the most bruises.  To this day, I find myself fascinated by technology more and more.  Best Buy has recently become my sanctuary, a place where I can go to inspire my curiosity by analyzing modern devices equipped with the latest Intel processors, the highest pixel cameras, and the brightest displays. In my free time, I can\\'t help but tinker, trying to find new ways to enhance my personal speaker system and to improve my recent project of developing homemade cell phone battery packs. Such a passion for technology and innovation is a product of my early childhood experience and influences, and honestly, I would not be the same without them. I hope to continue to apply this same combination of self-motivation and childlike curiosity in every aspect of my life. It\\'s how famous inventors in the past thought, and it\\'s what allowed them to question conventional ideas, to explore the depths of technology, and to create new innovations and ideas. I plan on being no different. It\\'s who I am.  \"}, {\"index\": 828, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] This was one of several essays that I wrote for college applications. Although Amherst College never read this particular essay, I got into many colleges with this as my common app essay.There are endless reasons why I should hate riding on airplanes. There is never enough quality food, the seats aren&#39;t comfortable, there&#39;s a complete lack of personal space, and I have to pay if I want to use the wi-fi. Ironically, even with all of the setbacks it is only on a airplane where I feel all of my problems and stresses disappear, as if I checked them in with my luggage at the airport. Time seems to freeze; there are no deadlines to meet, no issues at home to worry about. All I have to focus on is tracing the path of raindrops with my eyes as they race past my window on a cloudy day as I prepare for lift off.The feeling I get when I&#39;m on an airplane is almost indescribable. I get this rush, like I am a small child on a roller coaster, or an astronaut about to take off on a spaceship. I feel powerful as I defy gravity, looking down to see familiar buildings fade into a tiny, unrecognizable blur below me. Excitement surges through me as the plane takes off at an angle and I am pushed into the back of my seat. I am so content that I do not care that my ears are popping, or that the little kid in front of me is whining to his mother. I take out my old, beat-up iPod and turn the volume up so that the noises around me fade out into nothingness. All I can hear is the faint hum of the plane&#39;s engine under the music I downloaded from iTunes the night before.My fascination with airplanes extends beyond the enjoyment of riding on one. Whenever I am walking home from school, or reading a book on my balcony and I see an airplane flying overhead, I imagine myself on it. I put down the book I&#39;m reading, and I look up to the sky to watch it fly over me. My attention is drawn to the plane until it is completely gone, the smoke from the engine dissipating into the afternoon air. What would normally sound like loud, roaring noise to others sounds like music to my ears. I picture myself sitting in the window seat as I watch the small town that I have lived in for so long finally pass beneath me. I&#39;m always longing for a change of pace; my daily schedule feels structured and predictable and I find myself wanting to escape it and experience something new. I could be lying out on a breathtaking beach in the Maldives, or visiting the Louvre in Paris.I picture myself flying toward a bright future. I am flying away from my past and away from my childhood into a brand new chapter of my life. I do not know exactly where I will be in the next few years, but I do know that I am eager to experience the journey wherever my flight is destined. I am prepared and excited to go along for the ride, whether it be on an airplane or at a university.When I travel to college, I want to look down to see familiar memories fade into a tiny, unrecognizable blur below me as I embark on a new journey, the rest of my life. \"}, {\"index\": 829, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Ever since I was a child I would always find myself listening to the constant \\'clicks\\' from the computers that were at some stage of repair every morning in the living room.  Sound cards and microprocessors were spread across the floor as my dad attempted to detect the problems and complications within each computer\\'s casing.  Watching him struggle with each of these projects, I would sit next to him with one of these relinquished components and wonder about its functions and consider the possibilities of its outcome. Other than being part of a Puerto Rican-Chilean family, I undeniably come from a household where learning, along with family and health, is considered a priority and a necessity. My parents, especially my dad, always encouraged me from an early age to question my surroundings.  Not only has this helped in my learning process, but I have also discovered how to perceive things through observation.  Many people characterize me as somewhat of an introvert because of my introspection and this independent comprehension I tend to have as I try to explore and question the purpose of every element I encounter. My father died from esophageal cancer a year ago.   Even though he was struggling with this terminal disease, he still inspired and motivated me to learn new skills through involvement and practice.  As a result of my developing interest in technology, I decided to join my school\\'s robotics team. I accomplished my goal in not only winning local tournaments, but also in qualifying to national competitions.Now that my family consists of two people, I have had to learn to take responsibility for myself other than limiting myself to only the academic areas.  Right after my father died, I was offered to stay in the boarding school program of my school.  With these new changes in my life, I have had to learn how to cook, clean, do my own laundry, take my medicine when needed, wake up on my own to go to school, and do other tasks that many people my age take for granted.  Even though this was a tough process to handle, I have managed to overcome so many obstacles and become more than just a student.  I have developed into a more independent individual.When my father emphasized how important experience is, I had not realized how true this was until after he passed away. The calamitous event of losing my father has produced positive changes in me; it has transitioned me from childhood to adulthood.     I have had the benefit of excelling as a student, I continue to be a person who observes her surroundings and takes initiative to react to those changes in environments by taking full responsibility. I am confident that in the future I will be able to use my father\\'s words of encouragement to guide me through new goals and tasks.  As his daughter, I will continue his legacy in a more meaningful manner. \"}, {\"index\": 830, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] My parents, immigrants from India, often call me \\'too American\\' when I ask if I can go out to the movies. Friends often call me \\'too Indian\\' when I decide to study for a calculus test rather than to hang out with them. This clash between the two cultures closest to me led to my inability to define the world I truly come from. At school I attempted to speak, dress, and act like my peers. I was to be American. At home I attempted to speak, dress, and act like my parents. I was to be Indian. Nearly eighteen years later, I understand that the world I come from, for better and for worse is a combination of the two.   As early as I can recall, my parents have advocated the ideology that education comes before anything and everything. I understood this; however, I knew that limiting myself solely to academics would hinder my overall potential. As a result, I enrolled in a competitive basketball league when I was seven, and instantly developed a fervent love for the sport. Inside my house I studied, and outside I played basketball. Much like other aspects of my life, the door to my home separated these two cultures. As time went on, however, my Indian background began to merge with my American identity. My playing the sport I loved pulled my parents into my American life, which in turn showed me that my identity, rather than being explicitly Indian or American, would be an overlap between the two. Ultimately, basketball became the first stepping-stone in the integration of my polar opposite worlds. Though my world progressed towards cultural integration, my Indian roots projected me to become an engineer long before I could even pronounce the word. Moreover, I have always felt a particular connection with the field. I yearned for the opportunity to accompany my father to work. Attentively watching his colleagues discuss the design of the new heart valve that would save countless lives or seeing the code behind the latest computer software, I knew that someday I was going to be one of them. However, the more I indulged in the American world around me, the more I realized that my dreams go beyond solely being an engineer. Captaining my high school basketball team and being an officer of my school\\'s math and science clubs furthered my passion for being a leader among my peers. Thus, I aspire to not only leave a lasting impact in the field of engineering, but also to positively influence the nation that has accepted me as one of its own. As an adolescent, I loathed fitting the mold of an Indian-American child in the 21st century. From the lack of self-identity to the lofty expectations, I perceived the multitude of culture contrasts I faced as an insurmountable burden. However, I have come to appreciate the diverse range of cultures in my life, and because of it, can now confidently answer the once perplexing questions of who I am and who I hope to become. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It never ceases to amaze me how coddled I was throughout my childhood; my parents praised my every accomplishment, teachers glorified my academic achievement, and coaches revered my athletic promise. As a result, I constantly found myself walking the fine line between confidence and arrogance, the former essential for success, while the latter detrimental to it. I saw a side of life filled with adulation, lacking awareness of what the other, \\'ugly,\\' side held. That is, until I faced the Goliath that was my first year of varsity basketball.Being captain on the JV team the year before, I had high hopes for myself. I expected to contribute immediately, hardly recognizing that varsity would be an entirely new challenge. As we ran onto the court for the first game I felt my heart racing from anticipation. I settled down as the game progressed, eagerly waiting to demonstrate my abilities on the court. However, this didn\\'t happen and I left the arena without even breaking a sweat. By the end of our pre-season we had attained the best record in school history, but I was stuck at the end of the bench. Though ecstatic to be a part of a winning team, I felt as if I was no use to it. As the season advanced, our winning ways faded and we fell out of contention for the playoffs; still I wasn\\'t given the opportunity to contribute on the court. At this point my frustration intensified, at one point even causing me to contemplate quitting, and my emotions became evident to those around me. I had become distanced from the sport I had once been inseparable from.Ultimately, I felt as though the team was more important to me than my pride. I maximized my every opportunity to contribute, cheering louder than any fan and practicing with unparalleled aggression. This radical change in attitude was the turning point in my season. My passion was back, and the game was fun again. As the season concluded, I thought of the team banquet as a farewell to a truly unique season. My coach stood behind the podium, prepping to hand out the annual team awards. My name escaped his mouth as he announced the \\'Most Inspiration Player,\\' the player who showed outstanding leadership and constant passion. My jaw dropped as I stared at him in complete awe. I was the only underclassman to receive an award, and the turmoil I had faced throughout the year suddenly felt insignificant.While the award itself was fulfilling, it hardly compared to the knowledge I gained from my first year of varsity basketball. I had witnessed the other side of life, the side filled with struggles and hardships. By putting my ego aside and working hard, I was able to overcome my \\'Goliath.\\' One year later, I am captain of my varsity basketball team, thanks in large part to the difficulties that transformed my perspective on adversities. Adversity is an inevitable aspect of one\\'s life; how that adversity is handled is a true testament to one\\'s character.  \"}, {\"index\": 831, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Immigrant parents with a few dollars to their name and a tiny house packed full with fifteen people at one time isn\\'t exactly the ideal recipe for success. My father grew up with the odds already stacked against him, fighting an uphill battle from the beginning. Every year of his life was a struggle to overcome his situation, pushing himself through the endless hours of medical school, enduring the sleepless nights, raising a family in the midst of it all. Yet he fought against these forces with more strength than anyone I\\'ve ever known, and the consequences of his determination have inspired me to pursue my dreams with just as much drive.My passion is creating a better future for children who endure the pitfalls of poverty. I have worked at an orphanage and its surrounding community in Nicaragua for the past two years, and its impact on me has been huge. I witnessed extreme deprivation in every sense: a penniless community without opportunity, a hopeless situation of starving children and orphans scattered along the road. All I wanted to do was help these children, but the sheer magnitude of the issues that were plaguing this one community overwhelmed me. It seemed that whatever I tried to do would be lost in the shuffle, and that anything that could make a significant impact was far outside my capabilities. As I struggled with these realities, I remembered my father and how he tackled the seemingly insurmountable. I remembered just how daunting his obstacles were, how no one could have ever predicted that he would make it to where he is today. I want to carry on this legacy of refusing to give up even when the outlook is bleak. So I began to research micro-loans, food packages, and donation possibilities for the community. Although I can only operate on a small scale right now, it is my hope that as my resources and expertise grow, I can create greater and lasting impacts on this community and others like it.As I have experienced in my own pursuits and in those of my father\\'s, anything worth solving isn\\'t going to be easy. The obstacles are going to be demanding and there will be times when walking away seems like the only option. But what separates the good from the great, what marks the truly successful, is the ability to push on to the very end, to hold focus of the vision through every setback. I want to be the person who can look at a terrible injustice and transform it into a beautiful possibility. I want to pursue everything that I do with the same voracity as my father has in his own life. \"}, {\"index\": 832, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 833, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Essay 1: Throughout high school, I have given my all to learning, and have learned to love mathematics and the arts.

Coming from a multicultural background, from being born in Berkeley, California and moving to several places including San Jose, Costa Rica, we ended up moving to a rural, marginalized community in the cloud forest region called \\'Vara Blanca,\\' which also happens to be my father\\'s home town. We started anew there, trying to get accustomed with the place\\'s own unique isolated mountain beauty and challenges. It was a drastic change at first, for we did not even have telephone or internet. These things made little difference to me as a child however, as I created many of my best childhood memories here, such as roping and riding the neighbor\\'s cows and goats with friends, running amok through the forest, or going on multiple day camping trips with no tent. Life wasn\\'t easy though, as we then moved to Atlanta, and then to Pennsylvania after hearing that my grandfather went through a series of 7 strokes. It was hard to try to adjust to the new environment, especially considering my grandfather\\'s state. Even just living in the suburbs with my current view of life stemming from Costa Rica was different. I was too young to notice before, but I could now identify the disparity in affluence and attitude that was present in the U.S., where many of the things that would be a blessing to have in other places were taken for granted. Then, in one moment, after 2 years of being there, an earthquake with a 6.4 magnitude hit the small town of Vara Blanca. I did not hear at first, but found out later that around 80 people in the area were killed, with numerous others missing. Virtually everyone had infrastructure and property damages, with a good number of people even losing their homes. Worst of all however, I discovered that one of my best friends had passed away in the disaster. The loss and the void that it left was inexplicable. I still remember crying about it at night, not telling anyone because I didn\\'t wish to be a bother. We then decided to move back to Vara Blanca, and my parents opened up the first high school in the entire area, while working with community leaders to be a part of community development. Our family started many projects along with the high school, including an organic blackberry co-op in the area as an alternative to the strawberries with high level of pesticides, and a gardening/greenhouse project on our own farm. Although I sometimes did not appreciate it back then, my hands itch with with the desire to pick up a shovel and work in the earth again. Thankfully we were never lacking in our necessities (mostly due to my father\\'s incessant work ethic,) however there were some times when there was only rice and beans (thankfully it\\'s a complete protein) available to eat in our home. I then started to attend my parent\\'s high school, and from then worked hard with a small number of other kids from my town who had dropped out of school, deciding now to return, in order to pass national standardized exams, which we did with some of the highest grade averages in the country. I graduated a bit earlier than most of my peers, but nonetheless stayed with the high school, and began to work there as a volunteer teacher as well. Thus, my life has always taught me to look/dream for creative ways of solving problems using the richness of every circumstance, instead of being passive and thinking only about what is lacking.

Elymas has the answers. Spindly-legged, toothless, resting casually on his wooden staff, Elymas told me in a mishmosh of \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018Swahili-English\\' the lessons of living in the beautiful mud-hutted Maasai village nestled between an active volcano and the flesh-burning Natron soda lake in northwest Tanzania. Walking around Maasai bomas, he explained how generations survived the volcano\\'s wrath. There\\'s no handy binder, web database, or even a scrap of paper to give these people guidance and instruction. Fireside stories of survival, passed down through generations, have preserved this society. Elymas made me realize how important the culture of storytelling is in life. It has the power to inform, enrich, preserve, and rescue people from tragedy. Not only did Elymas teach me about who he is and his culture, he also helped me to further discover who I am.Before moving to Tanzania, I didn\\'t feel \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018smart\\' in a traditional sense. Seriously - my mom used to read Encyclopedia Britannica as a kid; my dad is a data & news junkie; my brother loves factoids. Me? I have always loved stories and reading. Even when I am far from a book, I cannot escape my love of stories. When I visited the British Museum this past summer, I looked around and saw swarms of people crowding the walls reading the laminated signs next to each artifact, listening to the audio-tour, or taking selfies next to the Rosetta Stone. I just wanted to sit on the bench in the Elgin Marble room and daydream of Demetrius calling out, wailing over Persephone\\'s marriage to Hades.  Or sit hearing the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018yarn\\' about Daedalus\\' workshop and Minas\\' labyrinth. Like the opening dramatic scene of the Phantom of the Opera, where cobwebs and filth are swept away and lights are lit, I could see the lifeless, broken statues re-form and become vividly lifelike. It was moving to Tanzania, living among storytelling people groups, and realizing that stories are powerful and enriching, that gave me a vision for what I want to do with my life. Just like my neighbors the Bantus, Maasai, and Waarusha, I also learn, speak, share and flourish in the vibrant world of stories. All I needed was a venue to throw myself into it.Not only was it in Tanzania that I discovered this, but I was also able to do something with it. A media group in Arusha was willing to let me join their team for several weeks to write dramatic scripts for teaching videos. These were to present instructional stories with fictional characters that could teach local Swahili-speakers some basic financial skills like the importance of saving, making a family budget, taking out responsible loans, and allocating family resources to things that produce more income.The results from this work were several co-authored, published, and animated 30-minute TV shows depicting everyday life in a humorous way while teaching farmers and small business owners how to improve their livelihoods and their family\\'s wellbeing. Through stories and humor we were able to educate, inspire, and hopefully shape the culture in a positive way. Even now, seeing the disastrous spread of Ebola in West Africa, I wonder how much more effective organizations like the CDC, WHO and even Doctors Without Borders would have been in preventing the spread if they had developed media-based stories to show prevention tips to villages rather than just posters of factoids and pictures. Too often storytelling is looked upon as childish and naive, rather than the powerful teaching method that it truly is. The storytelling culture of Tanzania has become my culture. I live in the stories that tell our past, present, and future. I want these stories to make a difference in the world, and I see how it can be done. I want to make Elymas proud. \"}, {\"index\": 837, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'Wow, that doesn\\'t look good\\\\u2026\\'Not exactly what I wanted to hear from a medical professional regarding my teeth, or lack thereof.It happened one Thursday night and left me sprawled out, face down on a volleyball court below a crowd of spectators. I lifted my tongue and felt just slivers of what had been my two front teeth. In a surreal daze and with the salvageable pieces of my teeth in hand, I was rushed out, while my mom frantically called my dentist. Finally, something clicked in my head and crashed me back into reality as fast as my teeth had slammed into the hardwood court\\\\u2014tomorrow night was Prom. Anxiety took over and my mind started racing. I had a party bus, a tuxedo, a date\\\\u2026and most of my two front teeth in my hands. Through the hyperventilation and impending tears, I hurled expletives at the world (and everyone within earshot) about how Prom was now ruined because of an ambitious dive gone terribly wrong.I waited in the dentist\\'s icy chair with sweaty palms and bated breath as he examined the mess that was my mouth with indifference, noticeably irritated about being called in after hours. He explained that my teeth would be far from perfect, causing my anxiety to subside but resignation to set in: \\'Well, Prom, this is goodbye. See you next year, unless life screws me over again.\\' But as I submissively waited for the laughing gas to take effect, I thought about all I had put into arranging the perfect Prom night and how I\\'d looked forward to it as the highlight of a stress-filled year. Resignation developed into resolution; through the growing haze of laughing gas I vowed to enjoy my night, regardless of what I saw in the mirror when everything was said and done.It turns out it wasn\\'t just the laughing gas talking.My younger self would\\'ve folded at the first sign of adversity and not had the confidence or courage to persevere. The ninth grader who got braces and avoided smiling at all costs would\\'ve sat up from the chair, seen the jagged, uneven and gapped teeth in the mirror and spent the night wallowing in his self-induced sorrow instead of appreciating an irreplaceable moment in life. That\\'s the difference between who I was and who I\\'ve grown to be. I no longer derive my perception of self-worth from others, or feel a need to look to anyone for reaffirmation of who I should be. Of course, I still don\\'t have impervious, unwavering self-confidence\\\\u2014I\\'m evidently susceptible to the occasional meltdown\\\\u2014but my personal growth in recent years has served as a catalyst for diminished inhibitions and improved community and social involvement. Only a few years ago I never would\\'ve believed that I\\'d soon take up a completely new sport, not knowing anyone on the team, or just have the confidence to wear purple pants and neon green shoes to school. I no longer dwell on the judgment of others, which has allowed me to take greater control of my life.I went to Prom with botched front teeth, but that didn\\'t stop me from standing tall and smiling wide for every camera. Nor will external opinions prevent me from living my life to the fullest again, something I\\'m reminded of each time I see the mangled smile gleaming back at me in the mirror.Stepping into room 123 each Wednesday brings a smile to my face. Filling the walls are equality signs, \\'NO H8\\' campaign posters, and rainbow flags. This is my home away from home: the Gay Straight Alliance, or GSA. As a closeted sophomore I was hesitant to join GSA, afraid of what people would think of me. I had always been too scared to open up to friends or family, fearing being vulnerable and expecting to be rejected and shunned, but I couldn\\'t bear the silence any longer. After months of build-up I finally walked in one afternoon. All fears subsided straightaway. It was instantly uplifting to hear people use terms like \\'cisgender,\\' \\'ally,\\' and \\'preferred gender pronouns\\' as opposed to \\'fag,\\' \\'tranny\\' and \\'homo,\\' which I\\'d grown accustomed to hearing mindlessly tossed around at soccer practices.I developed a deep intimacy with the other club members and one day let the words slip from my mouth. There was no fanfare; just a room full of sincere smiles that told me I was accepted, which was all I ever needed. I had an ear-to-ear grin the rest of the day; I probably looked insane, but I felt invincible. With a reinforced sense of security, I relinquished my reticence and became publicly involved. I now make signs to advertise meetings, work tables at school-wide food fairs, and participate in visits with neighboring middle schools to advocate acceptance and share personal experiences. If anyone had visited my middle school I might have had an easier time accepting my unalterable identity, instead of enduring years of internal strife and self-loathing.GSA is no longer an isolated component of my life, sequestered to Wednesday lunches; room 123 now influences all aspects of me. This environment and these people have added an irreplaceable pride to my life and ignited a passion within me to advocate equality and help others feel less alone. For instance, through extensive lobbying we\\'ve convinced our school\\'s administration of the importance of inclusiveness, and now have certain gender-neutral bathrooms on campus. I\\'m proud to say that this world of tolerance is expanding. Looking through past yearbooks, GSA\\'s club photo has increased in size each year, while ignorance and offensive slurs have declined dramatically. The entire school now screams acceptance, with \\'Ally\\' posters across the halls, displaying everyone from faculty to football players supporting the club\\'s causes.  GSA has instilled in me a fight for social justice, and has revealed to me my potential to incite progress. With the support of GSA, I\\'ve become a better version of myself; I\\'ve become part of the change I want to see.  \"}, {\"index\": 838, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] It begins at age 6.\\'Al-Shalash. What kind of last name is that?\\' The cashier asks, smiling warmly. I stand taller against the counter, grinning. I know the answer to this one. Arab. Arab! Say Arab. My mother is unsmiling. She does not say Arab. Her eyebrow arches: stony, defensive, cold. \\'American.\\' Her accent is thick. We all hear it. Nobody says anything else. ---\\'So, like, what are you?\\' I am 12, my vision blurred by the gray colored contacts I am wearing, and blocked by the piece of hair hanging in my face, flat ironed into submission. Arabic. I think of my mother, of the cold, defensive eyebrow. American?

An old woman approaches, her gait a shuffling stutter. \\'Eid Mubarak,\\' she says, smiling warmly. \\'Eid Mubarak!\\' we reply in unison, and giggle at our unintentional group-reply. She surveys us fondly, clearly amused by our exuberance. Her gaze lands on me. Her eyebrows shoot up to her hairline, and I see her take in my freckles, the red tint in my hair, my thin tank top. \\'How nice.\\' Her Arabic is rapid. I understand every word perfectly. \\'You brought an American friend.\\'  ---I am 15. My eyes are stinging. My Name is Asher Lev.  \\'This class,\\' my English teacher reminded us when she assigned the book, \\'is meant to be a way to expand your horizons-- to look at the world beyond you.\\' Asher is the definition of an outcast: alienated from his Hasidic Jewish culture by his art, and alienated from the art world by his Hasidic Jewish culture\\\\u2014he is perpetually stuck in a kind of gray area, between worlds, ideologies, and people, never really sure of his own identity. But it is this, I realize: his cultural seclusion, that makes his art innovative and interesting, that makes his worldview unique and textured\\\\u2014that makes him special.  And suddenly, I am not reading to learn about the world outside of me, I am reading to learn about myself.    ---The dots connect when I am 16, hunched over an Art History textbook. It is mostly painted in shades of gray, all sharp angles and jutting, pointed lines\\\\u2014stark and harsh and frantic in the way they scream and twist against the canvas. Guernica, by Picasso. In it, is a web, a universe of connections centered on one painting: a raging castigation of Franco, a plea for peace, a conversation about the meaning of art and the place of beauty and reality in its aesthetic\\\\u2014a tangled mess of connections.  The cultures that I am and am not a part of, the identity that I do and don\\'t have, give birth, in that moment, to an obsession with complexity, with that which\\\\u2014like me, like Guernica\\\\u2014cannot easily be defined.   If you were to ask me what the most beautiful painting in the world was, I would say the Guernica. And if you were to ask why, my response would be: because of what you can\\'t see. ---I am 17, on my lunch break at the Dallas Museum of Art, perusing a menu of one of the food trucks parked outside. \\'Excuse me?\\' a woman approaches me, looking at my nametag, \\'Sarah Al-Shalash.

Please, don\\'t think too far into that. With the toilet cover down and the door shut, this one sacred space affords me some much sought-after privacy in a house with five other people and a cat that insists on an open door policy. Surrounded by dental necessities, most would find themselves distracted, especially due to the bright orange and green color scheme. I, however, find peace in this one place where I am permitted to close the door and not open it when someone knocks or calls my name.I can hear the pitter patter of toddler feet running down the hall as I wince and try to preserve my concentration. Miniature hands pound on the door yelling their nickname for me, TT, as I reflect on the days before I ever considered this a place of contentment. I am brought back to the time before I had toddler sisters. This time was easier. There were fewer responsibilities, not nearly as many expectations, and fewer people vying for my time and attention. Despite my increased responsibilities and even further stretched time, I would not want my former carefree life back. Although I am now constantly seen as a role model for my newest sisters and must help my parents around the house more, I have gained much more than I have sacrificed. Nothing beats hearing a mousy voice say, \\'TT\\'s a princess,\\' as you come down the stairs in your prom dress, or shamelessly \\'flying\\' around the house with outstretched arms pretending to be Wendy from Peter Pan. Though I used to consider my room my safe space where I could escape from my growing to-do list and constant expectations, I now must retreat to somewhere that garners more respect for privacy.I remember a time before I ever had to worry about balancing it all. There was never too much going on, and never anything interfering with what I wanted to do. This was before school really pushed me, and before I really pushed myself. This was before I worked, and before I volunteered. This was before I had young sisters that grew before my eyes and made me want so badly to skip that last hour of studying and play outside. I remember a time when I didn\\'t think that the restroom really would become a place of rest, a time before I applied to college in the bathroom so that I could hear my own thoughts and focus on myself for once. To prioritize my commitments, maximize my opportunities, and still find time for myself has become no small feat. When my life became all about balance, the bathroom became my retreat.An end to the pounding on the door and the crying protests of small children brings me back to my present, back to the bathroom. It is here that I escape the customary \\'again\\' after the end of every game or story, as well as the continuous question of \\'why\\' that leaves every two year old\\'s mouth every five minutes. Instead, I bathe in the soft orange light as I concentrate and find my peace. It is in this bathroom that I can be found washing my face as an excuse to escape Ring Around the Rosy for the eighth time, or writing an essay at nap time so that I can close the door as a buffer against the screaming protests of my youngest sisters. Here, my words echo against the close walls and I am alone with myself. Though I enjoy the company of my close-knit family, this alone time is my salvation, despite the unusual location. \"}, {\"index\": 840, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 841, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I was on an early morning flight to Boston on April 13th, 2013, and it was the first time I had flown without my parents. I stared at the Massachusetts sunrise through sleepy eyes and snapped a picture that I promptly posted on Instagram at landing with the caption, \\'Rise and Shine Boston, it\\'s race day!\\' My stomach turned with anticipation to watch my dad, and world champions, race on the historic winding pavement of the famous Boston Marathon. With my carryon in hand, I exited the airport feeling independent, determined, and adrenalized. I knew I wanted to run the race some day.Seven hours later a police officer told me to run. My sister and I pulled our little brothers out of an overpass where a bomb was discovered below, and we kept running. We had to go ahead of our parents to meet with a car that would take us away from the scene. My dad, who had already finished the marathon at three hours and fifteen minutes, hobbled behind with my mom. Wheat, my 11 year old brother, yelled, \\'Go faster Dad!\\' just as he had a few hours earlier while my dad pounded the pavement of Heartbreak Hill.  I am thankful everyday that the pain in my father\\'s legs was from the grueling Bostonian hills and not flying shrapnel. We met the car at a gas station a mile away, picked up my straggling parents, and drove with haste toward Providence, Rhode Island. By that time news stations everywhere were broadcasting the events, but I only had to look out the window to watch hundreds of ambulances rush past. The smoke plumes haunting the Boston skyline got smaller and smaller in the rearview mirror. Lying on a hotel sofa bed in Providence, I stared at a pale blue ceiling trying to wipe the tears from my eyes. The sounds of Boston vibrated in my head, and I could still feel the bruising grip of my brother\\'s hand around my own. All I could do was succumb to the blueness of the ceiling above me and let exhaustion pulsate through my mind and body.  The pressure cooker bombs took away my high-school-bred invincibility and replaced it with fear and uncertainty. All six members of my family slept in one small hotel room that night, even though we had originally booked two. In the morning, we went to the Providence Rent-A-Car so we could begin our trek home down the east coast. There was nothing available except for a beat-up, white church van with peeling lettering. Wheat said, \\'This is too sketchy,\\' but that vehicle was our savior. We piled in and drove down I-95 without stopping. The radio was broken, so we talked, yelled, laughed and cried along the way as we passed around a bag of potato chips. In short, we were a family. In spare moments of silence my phone buzzed with texts from best friends and acquaintances saying, \\'Thinking of you today\\\\u2026 xo,\\' and simply \\'I love you, Annie.\\' Sitting in the backseat watching the landscape change, I was the safest I had been in hours.  Outside of that van I knew there was a big, frightening world that could test and work against me. Hatred occupies the hearts of terrorists, and fear burdens victims for years. But there are also doctors who save, a God who protects, and families that support. Before April 13th, bombs only existed behind the screen of my tv, and terrorists were just cruel characters in a faraway story. Those distant nightmares became a reality for my family, but the time I spent in that van showed me deep and unbounded love that disarms any bomb and outshines fear.   I was no longer indestructible, but I was durable with the support of the people I loved. \"}, {\"index\": 842, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] While family tensions and divorce are regrettably common in today\\'s society, my parents\\' divorce and subsequent legal confrontations have marred and continue to adversely affect my life. Tensions between my parents resulted in my sister and I unwittingly assuming the role of peacekeepers at a young age and we were both fundamentally changed by that role.Ever since the first grade, my parents have been polarized regarding two main issues: finances and child custody. As I grew older, I began to prefer the convenience of not having to live in two places and began to spend a majority of my time at one house. My mother, viewing this as a momentous threat to her child support payments, termed this as \\'moving out\\' and began to take increasingly drastic and manipulative measures to force me to spend more time with her, culminating with a legal battle during my freshman year.My mother\\'s attempts to force me to spend more time with her climaxed with her showing up randomly at my high school. At any moment\\'s time, I would walk out of class and she would be standing right outside the door, yelling at me. Other times, she would chase after me as I walked to my dad\\'s car and stand in front of it or sit on the hood to prevent him from driving away. These occurrences caused substantial friction between my mother and I and bred resentment within me over her willingness to invert my life over finances. Those experiences were highly embarrassing to occur in front of my friends and classmates and eventually drove my dad to seek a temporary restraining order preventing her from coming near me.Although the initial divorce proceedings were not lacking in malice or vengefulness, my young age shielded me from the potential negative influences on my temperament. In contrast, the routine meetings with psychologists and judges and giving testimony against a parent in a series of legal proceedings toughened my personality and significantly strained my relationship with all of my relatives on my mother\\'s side of the family. While the experience hardened me, it also served to cement the importance of my integrity and empathy in my own interactions with others.The majority of my family\\'s conflicts have been resolved, but they have a lasting presence in my life. My repulsion at the destruction of my parents\\' divorce created a strong resolve in me to devote myself to a career in the interest of the public\\'s benefit. I attribute my inclinations towards service as a direct result of witnessing extraordinarily selfish behavior between my parents committed simply out of spite. I do not view my parents as an archetype of conflict, but simply human in their response to hurt emotions. While I hold no blame towards them, I also have a steadfast desire to hold myself to a higher and fairer standard. I am confident that my resolve, and the character I gained from my experiences will exert a far-reaching positive influence on the lives of others, regardless of the career path I choose to follow. \"}, {\"index\": 843, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Four years ago, I failed out of the eighth grade. I didn\\'t care about school and I certainly didn\\'t understand the importance of an education. Positive role models were nonexistent in my world.My dad left when I was five. He joined a gang, started selling drugs, and was in and out of jail for most of my childhood. My mom soon brought home a new boyfriend, Fred, who was a meth user. It wasn\\'t long before my mom was addicted too. Fred\\'s word became law in our house, and he doled out punishment as he saw fit. I vividly remember the nights he beat my mom: little me hiding under my Transformers blanket, eyes squeezed shut, bare feet curled up under my man-sized Raiders jersey. As I cowered there, trying not to hear my mom\\'s sobs, I would pray that by burying the kitchen knives deep in my dresser, I had prevented Fred from killing us.Each day, I walked the two miles to school by myself. My mom never attended a parent/teacher conference or helped with my homework. I don\\'t even remember eating a single homemade meal; we were regulars at McDonald\\'s.By the time I entered middle school, I was too busy disrupting class to learn anything. Being the class clown got me exactly the attention I craved; it temporarily filled an emptiness that ached when I was at home, where I was always alone. Mom and Fred had been collecting cats for years, and by that point they had thirty. To avoid the stinging stench of cat urine, I barricaded myself in my room and watched hours of television. Immersing myself in other worlds kept my mind off the pain I felt, but I still cried myself to sleep most nights. Deep down, I was angry. I was angry with my mom, angry at the world, and most importantly, angry at myself. I was angry at myself for being so sad, so depressed and I didn\\'t understand what I had done to deserve it.The breaking point came during a simple phone call with my grandma, when I suddenly started to cry. My mom kept our family at a distance, and that was the first time I confessed the truth to anyone. Through tears, I begged grandma to help and she did, convincing my mom to let me move in with her.My new life wasn\\'t exactly what I expected. My aunt, who lives next door, insisted I do my homework with her every afternoon. Until it was done, I wasn\\'t allowed to do anything else. I hated it, but was afraid that if I didn\\'t follow the rules, I might get sent back to my mother. Slowly, my perception of school began to shift. I realized that not only was I capable of doing the work, but that when I did, I got results. The first time I ever earned an A, I surprised my math teacher with a hug. I had never been so happy. The feeling drove me to keep improving.I was shocked the first time a teacher asked me to tutor other students. Only a year prior, I had been failing. Doing well boosted my self-confidence, but it was amplified exponentially by helping others. I love spending lunch breaks and weekends tutoring classmates, in part because I clearly recall when no one was there to encourage or help me.Harsh as my childhood was, I learned invaluable lessons. I love my parents, but I never want to end up like them, and that gives me a fiery motivation to succeed. I\\'m living proof that our pasts do not have to define our futures, and I look forward to living a future I create: supporting others to achieve their dreams, and working to make a positive impact on the world.\"}, {\"index\": 844, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]      The bar was perched at a daunting 11 feet. I was tired, sweaty, and on my last attempt. I had rehearsed the layout of my vault; it became a mantra. No amount of practice was going to prepare me for this feat. I had to simply count my steps and run. Six\\\\u2014jump forward springing off the balls of my feet. Five\\\\u2014eyes focused on the bar; only one thing matters. Four\\\\u2014ignore the crowd\\'s stares. Three \\\\u2014Drop the pole consistently and quickly. Two\\\\u2014Don\\'t lose power--be aggressive. One\\\\u2014Jump. I had planned this jump perfectly, but the my failure was marked by the metal bar under my back.I have a natural tendency to overthink--from my comprehension of different atomic orbitals , to passing comments made by friends. This passion for analysis spawns from my deep-rooted need to comprehend.The concept of pole vaulting is simple: use your pole to jump over a metal bar. While the other athletes would simply jump, I would overthink. Before my pole vault competitions, I walked around the field acting out every single move I would do, miming the athlete\\'s progression. Every subsequent thought drew me away from actual motion.After my failure, practices were spent with me mind-mapping my jumps rather than jumping. My once healthy planning quickly turned into anxious insecurity. Each attempt down the runway ended with sudden abandonment. I did not trust myself to jump over the bar. Then, my coach said the two words I needed to hear: \\'don\\'t think.\\' It was an alien concept that contradicted everything that my teachers had ever told me. I had to trust that my pole would be there to support me and that I knew what I was doing. It was here that I started to understand a thought that would lead to success: Analysis, like everything, can be good in moderation; its abuse would be detrimental to my growth. With this newfound knowledge I could maximize my growth in multiple areas. To this day, I still haven\\'t cleared 11 feet, but I learned invaluable lessons through this failure. Newton\\'s first law: An object in motion continues in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. I can\\'t sit around expecting that people will come and help me; I must go forward and achieve. College will be a very different place where teachers aren\\'t always my advocates. Furthermore, I must always remember my goal and not lose enthusiasm to laziness. Newton\\'s second law: acceleration is produced when a force acts on a mass. The greater the mass, the greater the amount of force needed. The barrier to motion will come in different shapes and sizes and will appear at different points in my path. But I understand that no matter how big an obstacle is, there is always an amount of force to overcome it. I must use sheer drive, passion, and persistence to overcome the obstacles and move forward. Newton\\'s third law of motion: For every action, there is an equal and opposite re-action. There will always be forces pulling me back, and only some of them are controllable. Like gravity, some forces will always pull me back to the ground, but I must not let them deter my success. I must ride my determination and the support of my family, peers, and friends to unimaginable heights. These lessons will stay with me for the rest of my life. I know failure is inevitable. But when I meet failure, I will not sulk in shame and mire myself in thought. In the end, everything is less complicated than I make it out to be. I now know that my thoughtfulness can either be a strength or weakness depending on how I use it. In the future, I will trust myself and stay in motion. \"}, {\"index\": 845, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The 5 Stages of Being Biracial 1. DenialAt first, I think that I am just like everyone else. We all look the same in our little Seattle suburb. Maybe my hair is curlier than the rest of my friends, and my skin is a tone or two darker, but I have a mom and a dad just like the other kids. People always touch my hair, and when I\\'m with my dad, strangers often stare and ask if I belong to him. When attending father\\'s family barbeques, my 3rd cousins, twice removed, ask me why my skin is so light. But I brush it off. I can\\'t be that different from my family.2. AngerAt age 12 I reached an uncomfortable preteen stage. It revolved around \\'Mom, why does my hair have to be so curly?\\' and subsequent frying of it with a flat iron, just to look like my friends. When I go to family events on my dad\\'s side, I stick out like a sore thumb. I know their culture is supposed to be mine, but nothing in it feels like it belongs to me. I\\'m angry. How am I supposed to be a part of the family when I am so different from them? 3. Adoption \\'I\\'m half-black.\\' I tell people. In 7th grade, it is good to be different. I don\\'t feel accepted, but people in my dominantly white school see my heritage and deem it \\'cool\\'. Can I rap? Do I play basketball? Do I love watermelon? I laugh at these questions, and do not understand their deeper implication, but rather feel alive with my newfound heritage. Although accepting my culture brings me no closer to it, I feel that this is what I\\'ve been missing in my short life.4. Anger/AcceptanceAs I enter high school, I become aware of my heritage, and what it means to me. But despite where my family comes from, the questions are always, \\'Are you sure you\\'re black? Why is your skin so light?\\' I find myself feeling angry. Why does the way I look cause people to question where I come from? I begin to enjoy my dad\\'s side of the family. Finally, the gumbo begins to taste like home. I find my humor begins to develop into something like theirs: loud and comfortable. But as I grow into myself, and my heritage, my peers do the opposite. \\'You\\'re not black,\\' a student says to me.  But I am. I am not the color, or the stereotype, or the rap music. I am blood, I am the family, I am the late night barbeques and the gospel prayers. 5. Acceptance! (?)During my junior year of high school I attend a Student Diversity Leadership Conference in Washington D.C., and find myself in a group of multiracial students. Never have I been in a room with so many people that look so much like me. Our light brown skin, our curly hair, our beautiful range of eyes. There are others who have struggled and questioned and who have needed to belong. With them, I learn that I don\\'t need to validate who I am with the way I act or look or speak. The comments and assumptions may still bother me, but now, I know who I am. My identity is this: I am Auriana Woods. Half of my family is white, and I look a lot like them. The other half is black, and they are wonderful and loud and very obnoxious at times. It may have taken me a good portion of my life thus far to realize that what I look like does not decide whether or not I belong with them, but they are my family, and they are my home. The color of my skin does not define my identity, and whom I belong with. I decide that, and I have. \"}, {\"index\": 846, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] All I could hear was an eerie sound as my knee scraped against the school playground asphalt. When I tripped over my clumsy feet something far worse than my bruise had occurred. One of the brand new lightning blue velcro shoes my mom just bought me for my eleventh birthday was torn apart!The school nurse quickly bandaged me up and gave me a pair of old brown shoes to wear for the rest of the day. When I got back to class, my snarky classmate Sarah pointed out my laces were untied. I tried to stuff the laces into the shoes without drawing anymore attention, but she announced to the whole class, \\'My mom said that stuffing shoelaces in your shoe ruins the shoe, so you better tie them.\\'I barked back, \\'MYOB, mind your own business!\\'I was promptly sent to the timeout square and even though I \\'hated\\' Sarah at that moment, I was on the timeout square because of my inability to tie simple shoelaces. I was in trouble because I didn\\'t want to face this challenge. I hid my inability to tie my shoes for as long as I could remember. My older cousins used to tease me about not being able to overcome such a simple challenge and that feeling of embarrassment crippled my fingers even more every time I tried to learn. Instead of trying to address my shortcomings with lacing my shoes, I took the easy way out and just avoided the problem by asking my mom to continue buying velcro shoes. Embarrassing as it was, my biggest failure was that it took someone else confronting me to address a problem I already knew existed.When I went home I spent hours practicing on my mom\\'s worn out white Reeboks. I fought off the frustration and I finally tied my first \\'bunny ear loop\\'. It was not the finest knot and was pretty poorly tied, but I was filled with pride because I finally acknowledged and addressed the problem. My only regret was that I waited for someone else to approach me before I made the necessary changes. Luckily, I rose to many other challenges that appeared to be ordinary task for others without waiting to be told by others.Years later my mom barged through the door after her overtime expecting to find me hungry because she forgot to make me dinner before she left; however, that day she found out I make a mean bacon mac and cheese. I watched Youtube videos when I needed to learn how to tie a Windsor knot for my regional DECA business competition. I learned how to shave when I found out I was going to be speaking at my cousin\\'s funeral. As I matured I began to take initiative over my challenges and employ the resources available to me, unlike when I was ten and humiliation drove me to confront a challenge.Last year it seemed like every assignment I turned in for AP Language and Composition fell dramatically short of my high expectations while everybody else seemed to be doing great: the AP summer literary analysis on Frederick Douglass, B+, the huge grammar test, B. Initially, I considered waiting for Mr. B or my mom to confront me about my shortcomings. However, because of the obstacles I faced in the past I decided the best solution for me was to take control of my grades. AP English was like the old brown shoes I couldn\\'t lace, and if I just \\'stuffed\\' my grades and looked past them I would be losing valuable opportunities to grow as a student and individual. Therefore, I sought feedback overcome my issues, I went in the morning for extra help, and became more active in class. The change in my approach towards challenges is rooted in the straps of my old lightning blue Velcro shoes. \"}, {\"index\": 847, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I screw up all the time. It\\'s a well-cultivated skill, from being irredeemably clumsy \\\\u2013 table corners migrate into my path and coffee-cup holders snap in my grip\\\\u2013 to forgetting important appointments and hiking up mountains with maps in languages I can\\'t read. It\\'s sometimes demoralizing, often embarrassing, and always unavoidable. But to me, that adaptability is the most important trait I have: first being willing to make mistakes, and then always, always learning from them. I\\'m a messy baker. Literally \\\\u2013 I always emerge from the kitchen with flour in my hair and butter specks on my shirt, acquired from pounding butter and sugar into submission \\\\u2013 but also figuratively, in the sense that I\\'m always experimenting, trying to engineer a better lemon pound cake than the one before. It doesn\\'t always end well. While a meringue mix using lemon juice to replace cream of tartar (they\\'re both acids and that should stabilize the egg whites into stiff peaks \\\\u2013 right?) rose and stiffened properly at first, it became runny and unsalvageable; once, a plate of deceptively appealing chocolate biscuits turned out to have chunks of salt where there should have been sugar. (Those were gross.) But each time has also created better results for the future. Yes, lemon juice works, just not when combined with molasses; big labels are essential for all my containers. And I would never have discovered my favorite recipe for chocolate lava cakes, topped with a generous dose of raspberry reserve, if I hadn\\'t tried a new way of melting chocolate chips into a gooey, decadent mess. My academic pursuits are equally messy. Debate, at present, is probably something like the love of my life. It\\'s also like eating a giant slice of humble pie. My brain short-circuits. Nuances go straight over my head. I pilot a new argument that is missing a wheel. And then, inevitably, comes getting steamrollered by the other (better) team along with the ensuing twenty-minute commentary on exactly how I did everything wrong. Admittedly, it can be downright embarrassing. Once, in sophomore year, my feedback was: \\'Your rebuttal was just bad\\'. Still, I\\'ve found it\\'s how to improve. The night after a loss, I stay up in my hotel room to research, to turn up a list of answers and send them to my friends for additional review, and to practice arguments again and again. I\\'m proud to say that while my partner and I have definitely lost to the same team twice, we\\'ve never lost to the same argument. Messing up and moving on is likely the single unifying theme in my life. I find so many discordant things interesting \\\\u2013 from derivatives to Derrida to desserts \\\\u2013 that trial and error has been the only way to attempt to make sense of them. When I started high school, I loved the humanities. I dove in completely, reading (and misunderstanding) Foucault in my free time, finding and interviewing Susan Epperson herself for my National History Day project on the Supreme Court case Epperson v. Arkansas. Had I not immersed myself so entirely, I don\\'t think I\\'d be able to so determinedly declare an interest in science and engineering today. I still find incredible value in the humanities, but trying them out meant that I could compare that experience to ones of synthesizing aspirin in lab, of solving logic puzzles in geometry, of the neat interlocking pieces of a sandwich assay to detect metastatic breast cancer. That\\'s how I discovered a certain type of clarity in the sciences that I don\\'t think I can do without. I\\'m excellent at screwing up. Headaches aside, to me, it\\'s a singularly valuable skill when it comes to making decisions, to finding a right answer, or discovering that I don\\'t know anything at all. I look forward to making mistakes in the future. \"}, {\"index\": 848, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The steady hum of the fan murmurs in the silence of my dorm room. The brightness of the lamp contrasts sharply with the stifling gloom of the rest of the room. It\\'s way past midnight, yet I\\'m still awake, pondering. I lean back in my chair to get away, but the nagging reminder of a quickly-approaching deadline still overwhelms me. I can almost feel the depressive stress permeating the dorm as everyone races to finish his project. \"}, {\"index\": 849, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] What is home? To many, this question has a very simple answer, usually the address of their current house. I feel, however, that my answer to this question is much more complicated. Home is my little house on Pleasant Street, where I have lived and grown up my entire life. Home is my host family\\'s house on Juliantie in Piikki\\\\u00f6, Finland, where I lived for 6 weeks during the summer before my junior year. Home is my family and friends, who have loved and supported me through the good and the bad. Home is the other American students I met in Finland, who share my love for foreign cultures. Home is not caring what I look like because I know that the people around me will accept me anyway. I also find manifestations of the concept of home in the world around me. When I hear the song \\'I\\'ll Be Home for Christmas,\\' I think of my host family and how I wish I could be with them for the holidays. The phrase \\'home cooked\\' brings to mind an image of my mother, who always puts in the effort to make a full meal every night. I know how to say, \\'Welcome home\\' in four different languages\\\\u2014 \\'Bienvenido a casa,\\' \\'V\\\\u00e4lkommen hem,\\' \\'Tervetuloa kotiin.\\' And I wholeheartedly agree with the statement, \\'Home is where the heart is;\\' a small piece of my heart lives in each place I have traveled to, making the world my home. By the way, I take the phrase, \\'Make yourself at home\\' very seriously (Yes, I will gladly stay for dinner. And do I want to spend the night? Why not?). I don\\'t just have a second home; I have a third, a fourth, an infinite number of homes. And my door is always open to everyone, be it a close friend or a stranger, so that I can return the favor and give someone else a new home. (I\\'ll make you dinner . . . and maybe even dessert, too!) Sometimes I yearn for a different home, to return to my memories of Minnesota in August or Finland in June or Washington in January or a myriad of other places and times. But then I remember to live in the present and appreciate the time I get to spend in this home. Because someday, although it may be difficult for me to believe, I will miss my mother\\'s home-cooked meals, the way I can see the sunset through my living room windows, and my nightly walks around the cranberry bog with my dog. Five years from now, the smell of chicken parmesan will bring back a flood of memories just as the smell of Finnish pulla, filled with cardamom, butter, and eggs, does for me now.   In the years to come, I know that my definition of home will most likely change countless more times. There is one thing, however, that I will remain sure of: although it is very difficult for me to define \\'home,\\' I always know it when I find it. The feeling of being at home is unmistakable, and I will never forget the moments when I realize that a group of friends has become my new family. I find myself at home while wandering around Stockholm all by myself (I successfully found my way from Gamla Stan to the Royal Library without glancing at my map once), but I also feel at home while spending time with the friends I have had since elementary school. I have finally come to the realization that no matter where I am, if I am with the people who best understand and accept me, then I am at home. And if at some point I feel as if I have strayed too far, I can always come back. Because there is no better feeling in the world than coming home.  \"}, {\"index\": 850, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] In the seventh grade I was offered gang protection. My San Francisco middle school was smack in the middle of the territory of one gang but also attended by children of other area gang members. As I walked down the hall one day, pass in hand, I noticed a lone figure farther down the way, struggling under a pile of sheet music, probably suffering through a detention. Hoping to prolong my absence from Pre-Algebra, I offered to help carry his burden to the music room. I recognized him as a boy in the grade above me, who often got in trouble for wearing a red bandana and fighting. We walked in awkward silence, as boys and girls in middle school do, until we dropped our piles onto the music office desk. We smiled at each other, acknowledging our shared chore, before he turned to leave. He stopped at the door and twisted to look at me, fiercely serious, and said, \\'If you ever need anything, let me know.\\'I only spent five years in the poverty that it\\'s likely this boy spent his whole childhood in. His life was centered around his position in his gang, and mine around reading. I was shocked by his offer and thought it a funny development, but to him it was reality. Although I was connected to the students I went to school with by food stamps and hand-me-down clothes, I was still an outsider. Options have been presented to me that some of my San Francisco friends may not have, like a college education. Although coming of age with limited opportunities was a painful process, I am thankful for the fact that I have had the chance to learn the value of my privilege.When I didn\\'t have to watch my sister, I spent after school hours at the public library, a few blocks from home. My favorite place to sit and read was far in the back, a cushioned window seat hidden among the less popular tomes and dictionaries. The smell of old paper, the lazy sunlight that filtered through the window, and the almost constant silence created a comforting environment very different from my school and home life. It was when I read James Joyce\\'s Ulysses and stumbled over the foreign words that I had to reach for the Latin dictionaries shelved mere feet from my cozy haven. My eyes were opened to the language, which has a certain mathematical quality that pleases me to this day, always reliable in its grammar. The myths that had fascinated me as a child were written in an equally fascinating language. I was hooked on the culture of the Roman Empire too, so different from my own and yet from which we borrowed so much. I took on the task of reading everything I could get my hands on.As I grew older in a new community, I viewed the inequality I had seen in San Francisco in a more knowledgeable light. The socioeconomic disparity I had witnessed resulted from a blend of misogyny, racism, classism, and ableism. I studied intersectional feminism alongside ablative absolute, and for me, becoming aware of the politics of classism coincided with cum clauses. I wanted to know about the people who had lived in ancient cultures like the Roman Empire and how they had dealt with the experiences I, my mother, and the boy I helped had faced, so I delved into research, and from there my passion for classical studies was born. This passion pushed me to continue learning Latin even when I didn\\'t have a tutor or classroom. When I was offered protection in seventh grade, I received another gift from that boy. He ultimately helped to open my eyes to the intersection of privilege, history, and language, and since then I\\'ve come to trust my own intellect in making connections across cultures and times. \"}, {\"index\": 851, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Being big is something I\\'ve always struggled with. I was always the biggest kid in class and have always been the butt of jokes.I never responded, but these jokes ate away at me. I always believed that it was my fault and my size came from eating toomuch, not exercising enough, and having bad genetics. I spent my summers at basketball camps, not to have fun, but to loseweight. This worked temporarily, but the minuscule amount of weight I lost soon returned. I then turned to AAU basketball. Inever truly was invested in the game, but in losing weight and ending the onslaught of jokes, and finally being able to have theconfidence to speak to girls. I wavered on throughout the season, never fully invested in the team and continued to lackconfidence.Then one day I sat with my Uncle Mike and he asked me, \\'How\\'s basketball going? \\', and I responded with a mundane \\'Ok\\'.He then asked me if I felt like I was getting anything out of it and I told him,\\' Yes, I\\'m losing weight.\\' He became angry with meand told me some advice that has shaped me greatly,\\' You are who you are. We are all different and what truly matters is whatyou do to become the best you.\\' From that day I haven\\'t worried about my size, but focused on trying to be the best me.Sure I continued to be referred to as 3 bills and Justin 300, but I haven\\'t let the names define me. I have been able to feelcomfortable in my own skin and this has allowed me the confidence to pursue my goals. Academically I have been able tobecome an active participant in class along with feeling confortable working in groups. Athletically I have been able to focus onbeing the best me. Additionally I have been able to focus on being a great teammate and having a great work ethic when itcomes to watching film and developing my craft as an offensive lineman. Most importantly this change has help me socially; I\\'mnot scared to introduce myself to new people or to have conversations with friends.

It wasn\\'t the fact that I was on a plane. I had flown many times before. It wasn\\'t the fact that I was flying to Europe. I had done that two years ago when my family returned to Moscow with my adopted sister. This time, it had to do with me. I was sitting next to an old English man with ruddy skin that glared my direction every time the cabin jostled and I accidently bumped him. I was flying by myself to go somewhere I had never been before. I was flying to London. Before I left my world of Suburbia for \\'across the pond\\', I was packing everything and double-checking I didn\\'t pack any shirts with words on them. I didn\\'t want to be that \\'American\\' tourist. With a backpack, duffel, and suitcase in tow, my parents and I headed off to the airport. I said goodbye to my parents. I wouldn\\'t be seeing them for another two weeks, the longest I had ever been gone from home.Landing in London, I had the sense that something has changed. In that trans-Atlantic flight, I had changed. I was independent. Of course I has been to sleep away camps, but this was different. I was thousands and thousands of miles away. I was on my own. A ten-day adventure was ahead of me. I had no idea what to expect. While in London, I went to lectures and was introduced to some of the top global businesses that are headquartered in the city. I sat in a glossy boardroom and learned Harrods\\' marketing strategy of why they only have one store and one sale a year. I scribbled notes furiously as I learned the corporate difficulties of the Associated Press. I not only learned about business but I learned about myself. I learned that I could walk along The Tower Bridge at night without my parents and buy fish and chips wrapped in newsprint from a seedy cart-vendor. I was adventurous. I was brave. I was independent. I was learning to be me. When my journey through London came to an end, I boarded the Eurostar. Facing backwards as we left St. Pancras, I reflected on the amazing memories I had made and anticipated the experiences to come. Next Stop, Paris.  The City of Lights was mesmerizing. I climbed up 669 steps of the Eiffel Tower to see the twinkling city lights. I learned the market strategy of Louis Vuitton during the day and gasped at the breathtaking scene of Notre Dame splashed against orange in the evening. I learned how business fused with art in the fashion houses on Champs-\\\\u00c9lys\\\\u00e9es and ate pickled duck for lunch in the Louvre. I learned that I could do things I never thought I could. I could order my whole dinner in French, use a foreign subway, and haggle over prices of street art. My adventures in Europe are a defining moment in my life. It changed and solidified many things within me. I had always known that I wanted to go into business, but all I saw was practicality. Through the meetings with the marketing director of Harrods and the designers on the Champs-\\\\u00c9lys\\\\u00e9es, I realized that there is creativity in business. The ingenuity needed to be successful in the field entices me. Within marketing, I can be creative and innovative. Most importantly, my trip to Europe permanently changed me. I transformed from a child to a young adult. I made my own decisions and learned not from a textbook, but real world experience. I was independent in an unknown world. The trip has altered who I am, and has shaped who I will become.     \"}, {\"index\": 854, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 855, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Paperwork consumes the room. Some essays are stacked to the ceiling while others are crumbled in the trash. Despite their placement, their screams are the same: \\'I\\'m smart! I\\'m different! Pick me!\\' For an admissions officer, this scene is too familiar and resembles their surroundings as they skim essays to answer the question: \\'why is this applicant different?\\' For an applicant like me, this scene evokes terror and causes the applicant to spend days dedicated to finding the answer. I could force an essay about my alcoholic father or being harassed freshmen year. Maybe I should write about being vegetarian. Would that make me different? Finally, I realized perhaps the experience that best illustrates the diversity I would bring to a college campus is this essay where I admit to an admissions officer that while on paper I may resemble other applicants, I have much more to offer.  After all, when sifting through applicants, admissions officers always find students who are devoted leaders. I too can appear to be an average devoted student. I spend hours after school, start service projects within my community, and create new ideas to solve problems. However, while other students radiate confidence, I am a leader who radiates both confidence and a quirky persona, which fosters a more humanistic and fun atmosphere. From tripping over carpet in front of thousands to giving a speech filled with cheesy puns, I have always been one beat off everyone else, yet I\\'ve embraced my differences rather than given up. As if performing a dance, I understand society\\'s choreographed expectations, but I showcase them as a solo rather than a robotic routine.  Unfortunately, the only societal dance that I\\'ve been unable to transform into a spotlight solo are my standardized test scores. In fact, I\\'ll be the first to admit that if test scores designated college acceptance, I\\'d be slightly below the average applicant. Unlike the model college student, natural intelligence has never been my strength. I am the brown-haired girl who others swear \\'should\\'ve been a blonde,\\' the oblivious girl who shrieks \\'oooh!\\' when a new discovery is made, and the headstrong warrior whose average-sized brain has never been a roadblock. I take pride in the fact that I am the stubborn student who forces herself awake at night to learn physics and calculus because, unlike others, I find an A worthless unless it illustrates new, valuable knowledge I have achieved. For me, \\'getting an A\\' or \\'good enough\\' are ridiculous terms when the opportunity to gain knowledge, foster new ideas, and achieve the extraordinary exists.   I could elaborate on how, unlike most students, I take my ambitions so seriously they become realities or how I dream of changing the world rather than obtaining wealth but these traits are only minute qualities of an unique applicant. The diversity I offer a college campus is best illustrated through instances like this essay; it lies in details that are so plentiful and mysterious only experiencing them will serve them justice.  \"}, {\"index\": 856, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 857, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea.  What prompted you to act? Would you make the same decision again?  Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg were my childhood heroes. I heard stories of how they single-handedly transformed the digital age. These stories led me to a short-sighted belief: when I left my mark on the world I, too, had to do it alone.  Following my heroes, I began a journey into computer science at a young age. It started when I was nine and my dad bought me a Sony Playstation. I loved playing video games, but I never found the perfect game. To solve this dilemma, I decided to create my own games, and thus, I dove into the world of programming. However, I was very stubborn. When a computer bug appeared in my program, my dad offered to help, but I refused. Like my heroes, I wanted to do it alone. When I entered high school, I was so confident in my computer skills that I signed up for the hardest computer science class offered, AP Computer Science. As the only freshman in the class, I didn\\'t know anyone else, so I chose to work alone. Actually, I preferred this anyway because I thought that other kids would waste my time. I did not trust the quality of their work, and thought I would end up doing most of the project in the end. As the class progressed, other students began forming teams, and I soon realized that their group projects were far better than my solo effort. Luckily, a friendly senior student approached me to join his team. As a team, we worked together to solve problems faster, avoid bugs, and create an advanced finished product. I started to see the benefits of teamwork, but I was not sold just yet. The following semester I joined the debate team. Since debate was a competitive event, I viewed my teammates as competition too, and kept my research and ideas to myself. While I was relatively successful at the local level, I soon learned that the state tournament would be a far bigger challenge. The night before the tournament, we were all scrambling to find evidence and develop arguments. Midnight came and went, and the president of our debate team insisted that we work together. In the end, fifteen of us crammed into my small hotel room and researched until four in the morning. Thanks to our hard work, the following day we won the state championship. On the bus ride home, I reflected not only on how much more successful we were together, but also on how much more fun it was to work as a team. During my junior year, I was extremely fortunate to be admitted to a Youth Entrepreneurship Incubator program called Catapult at the Harvard Innovation Lab. My business idea was (removed for privacy). I was paired with another applicant who had a similar business plan, and we worked with two other students who were interested in our ideas. The program required all four of us to work as a team. Together, we were able to handle the huge amount of work and turn my idealistic vision into a practical solution. At the end of seven months, we created a company that we felt would have an impact (removed for privacy). As we pitched our product, (removed for privacy), I knew I could never have created it alone. Despite my preference to work alone, my proudest accomplishments have been achieved through teamwork. My childhood dream of impacting the world alone was ill-conceived.

I try to resist, but I am easily thrown out of my comfort zone when confronted with new situations and new people. An unfamiliar country, an unfamiliar language, and unfamiliar family therefore would present me with an extraordinary challenge.When I first meet my \\'Grandpa,\\' he doesn\\'t seem too interested in me. He has a fat hand-rolled cigar positioned in the space where his front teeth and incisors should be. I politely decline when he offers me one. He mumbles something indecipherable and continues about his business. Meanwhile, the rest of my new Paraguayan family bombards me with questions, and I do my best to answer in my classroom Spanish.The next day, I wake up before dawn. I want to show my family that I am a hard worker. Anyway, I can\\'t sleep with the cacophony of animal noises outside. No one else seems to hear the sounds, as Grandpa is the only one stirring. I follow him as he walks to a fenced off area where the animals are kept. He notices me following, grins a toothless smile, and slows for me to catch up. He begins untying the cows, and I rush to do the same. After successfully getting one of the knots untied, I look up for approval to see that he has finished untying the other eleven. \\'It\\'s okay, I\\'m new to this\\' I reassure myself.Grandpa waves his hand, gives a shout, and the cows respond. We follow as they begin up the path to the field. As we walk, I muster the courage to break the silence. I blame my Spanish when I get no response. I try again, and again, but still no response. Blood rushes to my face, which I then lower to hide my reddened appearance. Suddenly I realize why he is not responding. Grandpa doesn\\'t speak Spanish. He only speaks Guaran\\\\u00ed, the indigenous language of Paraguay. I try to remember the one phrase I know. I ask his name, \\'Nde Mba\\'echa Nderera?\\' After releasing a big smokers\\' cough-laugh, he answers, \\'|||||||||||.\\'My days in Paraguay are filled with responsibilities in the community. Still, I never fail to begin each day with |||||||||||. Each morning I rise before the sun, and join him as he makes his way out of the house and to the cows. Each evening I rush home to mirror the ritual at night. He points things out to me along the route, and shares their Guaran\\\\u00ed names. Every day we communicate better, and every day we share more of ourselves. Our conversations are elementary at best, yet meaningful.One night I am woken up to |||||||||||\\'s prodding. I follow him outside, where one of our cows is moaning and lying on the ground. After a few minutes, a literally steaming calf emerges into the frigid midnight air. That calf, he tells me, will be named after me - \\'|||||||||||.\\' I am filled with love; love for this amazing newborn creature, this old man, and the community that has welcomed me.I accomplished much while in Paraguay. However, my relationship with |||||||||| stands out. I will always have tendencies to keep to myself. However, my Grandpa taught me that there are many ways I can share. He gave me both the language and the courage to build relationships with others in the community. We both cry as we sit together during my last meal. I cry again when I land in Los Angeles. The distance between us now seems insurmountable. I often get glimpses of him as I Skype with the rest of my family. With a hand-rolled cigar in his mouth, he peers into the frame to get a good look at me and to tell me that \\'||||||||||||\\' is healthy and happy.

I started meditating when I entered my junior year in high school. Given all the stress from prepping for SATs, club activities, preparing for three AP exams, class tests, projects, essays, extracurricular activities, and chores, it was a natural time to start meditating.  While relieving stress was my primary motive, I realized I gained much more: knowledge and contentment. When I meditate, I chant the mantra \\'AUM\\' slowly, stressing the sound of each letter, creating a vibration that drives me into a deeper state of meditation as time passes. It feels that I\\'m releasing bad energy\\\\u2014worries, headaches, anger, sadness, and stress\\\\u2014with each \\'AUM,\\' and bringing in love and devotion, allowing me to delve into a deep, pleasing state of meditation. At this point, I feel like I\\'m touching my inner self, where all the positive energy\\\\u2014patience, humility, and happiness\\\\u2014seems to flow. Meditation has taught me a lot. I refined my abilities to observe and concentrate\\\\u2014I see things clearly, especially small details that I would have initially glossed over.  For example, I noticed that the North American mammals exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History seems like snapshots of time\\\\u2014and they actually are! On top of that, my attitude becomes positive. I become courageous\\\\u2014I feel like I can do anything. Also, meditation provides me with a calm heart, which allows me to gain insightful awareness, which, in turn, allows me to gain control over my reactions in a tranquil fashion. I can see flashes of my pure mind, which is part of my inner self; I see the good side of myself: a nice, determined, hardworking, caring, and lovable person. I know that if I continue to meditate, I will refine my abilities even more. Then I will see my problems with lucidity, apply solutions, and become freer. When I meditate, I enter my sacred place\\\\u2014my inner self\\\\u2014where I learn a lot from myself. I feel contentment when I meditate. I remove my mind and senses from the distractions of my house and neighborhood to contemplate the sound of \\'AUM\\' with concentration. It is a focused thinking, and through this I realized how the human will is powerful. I use my will to meditate, and it made me realize how organizations\\' foundations are based on the human will. For instance, we wanted to improve society, so we created community service clubs. We wanted to pray and believe, so we created religions. Human will can change the world. My will drives my life. Moreover, through focused thinking my mind and body function together in one harmonious unit. Meditation helps me overcome mental blocks, negative thoughts, worries, fears, and stress by figuring out their cause and dealing with them.By regularly meditating, I feel that I can learn about the essence of things; I feel that I can gain insight into human nature; I feel that I might be given a glimpse of the cause of human suffering \\\\u2013 and its solution.

Parrotfish crunch on coral in the reef below, preparing to cloak themselves with a nightly mucus bubble, a translucent nightgown. Kelp swishes in the tide with lobsters scurrying up and down the long stems. And if I\\'m really lucky, I hear the high-frequency squeaks, whistles, and clicks of a pod of dolphins, a passing moment never forgotten.Thirty-six feet. Thousands of brittle stars congregate throughout the sandy bottom.

Now it\\'s time to observe beauty in a place where vocal exclamations don\\'t exist, only hand gestures. When I spot a bat ray nuzzled down into the sand, the only thing I can do is move my arms up and down by my sides as if to imitate the ray\\'s movement and hope someone will see me. Sometimes it\\'s a gift only for me.One hundred feet. Two and a half city blocks underwater. Every color fades to shades of blue and grey. There\\'s no jutting up to the surface in an emergency from here. Tiny gas bubbles built up from time at depth can so easily expand within arteries, causing decompression sickness, commonly known as \\'the bends.\\' Run out of air and the only thing to do is remain calm and signal to a buddy to share -- a pleading signal for the ever-important alternate air source hose, otherwise known as the \\'octopus.\\'Quiet observation, silent reflection, inaudible expression. The red hand of my depth gauge swivels around its axis as I descend. The necessity for pure, simple communication increases, allowing me to figure out how to express myself effectively both underwater and above. Having the opportunity to break away from the typical interactions of my day and spend even just an hour communicating in a manner so atypical to most is absolutely captivating to me. Instead of words, which flow easily, I talk with my hands, with my eyes, with my whole body. Everything but my mouth, unless it\\'s to crack a smile. Now, I weightlessly float along, clapping with delight. \"}, {\"index\": 863, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Thump. That\\'s the twentieth time I\\'ve heard that sound today. What happened? I fell on my butt. Again. When I was eight, I was inspired by the movie Ice Princess to fall on my knees and begged for ice skating lessons. From the very moment when I took my first steps on the ice, I truly felt like a princess, and eight years later, I still feel the same way. The crisp atmosphere, the faint music of flashing arcade games, and even the stale air signify my second home. Figure skating is my passion, and I love it with all my tiny, fist-sized heart. However, the entire eight years in between haven\\'t always been a fairytale. Initially, I felt like nothing could ever bring me down. And for a while, nothing did. For years, I had simply passed all of my tests on the first try. Until I was eleven. It was then I experienced my first real disappointment: I had failed my Intermediate Field Moves Test a second time. I kept my chin up and smiled, telling everyone that it was fine and that I would just do better next time. After all, I would say, third time\\'s the charm, right? I practiced in the blistering cold before dawn, and again in the afternoons until sunset. When my next testing opportunity came around, I was confident. I kept my legs extended, knees straight, and toes pointed, all with an easy smile. When I got my results, I was devastated and perplexed as to how I could have failed again. It was at that point in my life that I paused and reflected profoundly upon my skating; I clearly couldn\\'t keep doing what I was doing. What I needed was to make each attempt not only an attempt, but improvement, letting every thump teach me what not to do. As I undertook that emotional journey, I stumbled upon something \\\\u2013 I was too caught up in the details, too worried about passing that I forgot about the bigger picture. I forgot that skating is founded upon speed and power, not just perfectly pointed pinky toes. And as the next few weeks passed and I improved my speed and power, I realized I had forgotten something else: love. I forgot that I skated because I loved it, that my happiness didn\\'t depend on a test. With these two epiphanies, I gradually became a better, happier skater, finally able to see the bigger picture, and I achieved more in the end. Since then, I\\'ve unlocked a few secrets about figure skating, and now, I have earned two Gold Medals from the United States Figure Skating Association, and I am only two Gold dances away from earning my third and final Gold Medal. Just because my skating accomplishments are speckled with failures doesn\\'t mean that I am not content, especially because success is defined on my own terms. This definition is eight years in the making, and every day, it changes a little bit, because every day, I change a little bit. True, even today I face challenges, but because I am exposed to these constant opportunities to push myself, I have learned how to face difficulties, how to triumph even when it seems impossible. Figure skating has irrevocably influenced my perspective, on and off the ice, and continues to be my love affair to this very day. This sport has given me so much that I wish to give back. As a volunteer coach, a performer or simply a friend, it is my dream to inspire people, even if just one person, with the love of figure skating \\\\u2014 the same love that inspired me.Thump. I climb back up, brush myself off, and skate on. \"}, {\"index\": 864, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The moment before the curtain goes up and the ballet begins, all the lights backstage go out. Soon, the curtain will rise, but for now, almost palpable anticipation radiates from my fellow dancers on the dim stage. Although I\\'ve been performing for large audiences since I was six, nervous jitters flutter in my stomach, brain, and feet, freezing my whole body in place. Being a classically trained, pre-professional ballet dancer is easy. Sure, I could never wear sandals because of my bloody, stinky feet; wearing a leotard in public always drew stares; and I spent more hours than a part-time job dancing on my toes in pointe shoes; but my love for the art ran so deep I wasn\\'t fazed by the negatives. Growing up as a ballerina, I learned to define my life as time dancing, and time between dances. Without realizing it, I built my identity within the walls of a dance studio, isolated from the world outside of the one in which I felt comfortable. And I excelled at my daily routine: school, dance, homework, repeat. Then, the executive board of the Rockford Dance Company announced the hiring of the third new artistic director in five years, sparking the idea in my head that my own life could use a change as well; it was time to break out of my dance cocoon a year earlier than anticipated.Objectively contemplating the choice between another year of intense ballet training, when I knew I didn\\'t want to be a professional dancer, and a year to embrace new opportunities, I decided that I was ready to discover what normal people do and make non-dancing friends. Driven by a burgeoning desire for excitement and experience, I made the decision not to sign my contract to be a ballet company member for a fifth year, a position I had worked for my whole life. I changed my focus to dancing for fun and fitness, making classes even more enjoyable, and chose to stop performing because of my minimized dance schedule. Once my mind turned to new pursuits that dancing at top levels precluded, there was just no turning back.Without having to spend so much time in the studio, I dove into activities that had always appealed to me: new opportunities such as Student Council, Ultimate Frisbee, and a job scooping ice cream, as well as expanded leadership positions in my Girl Scout troop and environmental club. (I\\'m especially looking forward to cutting my hair shorter than the ballet-acceptable length for the first time ever.) Discipline, commitment, and passion, characteristics I learned through ballet, are now helping me to succeed in new pursuits. I have come to understand that I actually thrive on change \\\\u2013 something I never could have discovered in my little dance bubble, and an important truth for me to learn before the transition to college. Most importantly, I grew up. Exiting the dance stage felt like letting go of my childhood, improvising my next move instead of following a choreographed path, for once not knowing the next set of steps but taking them anyway.Life is a lot like ballet; a large portion of time is spent in daily routine \\\\u2013 practicing, perfecting \\\\u2013 punctuated by exciting and nerve-wracking performances. Although I no longer perform on brightly lit stages in front of thousands of people, sparkling in rhinestones, I have come to appreciate life\\'s other performances \\\\u2013 getting a paycheck, planning an event for younger Scouts, going on a first date, scoring the winning Ultimate point. Now, when the curtain rises and the orchestra plays, it\\'s a different scene, and new music, and I am drawn onto this different stage to be the person I\\'m enjoying discoveringBeing a classically-trained ballet dancer is easy; choosing not to be one was hard, but I am so very ready for what lies ahead, even if it isn\\'t accomplished under a spotlight in a tutu. \"}, {\"index\": 865, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Bbu bbu pfft, bbu bbu bbu pfft. Bbu pfft pfft bbu pfft, tuka tuka.I first began beatboxing when I was in fourth grade. I was an Asian kid with a bowl cut, respectful and shy, when a neighbor showed me a video of a man on French TV laying down the funkiest, freshest, grooviest beat I had ever heard. It was a mash-up of Michael Jackson&#39;s hit song &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and Usher&#39;s club banger &quot;Yeah!&quot; It was unlike anything I&#39;d ever heard.Beatboxing is the art of imitating drum and turntable noises with your mouth, tongue, and throat. From the moment I heard those sounds, I was obsessed. They were so different from the classical music that my parents listened to. Beatboxing (and its associated musical genre, hip-hop) became a passion. As such, my love affair with beatboxing initiated my first adventure in learning.I had always been a dutiful student, but for the first time, I found myself excited about learning. I guess you could say that with beatboxing, I learned how to learn. Physically, I began to practice making realistic drum sounds with my mouth. I constantly watched beatboxers on youtube for hours on end, trying to shape my lips and control airflow to create a specific noise. When watching wasn&#39;t enough, I began to study diagrams of the mouth. I learned that to recreate the sound of a snare drum, I would have to raise my tongue to the soft palate and create a buildup of air pressure behind my tongue. I discovered that recreating the record scratching noise that is so prominent in hip-hop music is created by breathing inward.Even as I grew more proficient at replicating rhythms and sounds, my curiosity about beatboxing and hip-hop grew. I began subscribing to trade magazines such as The Source\\\\u00b8 XXL, and Vibe. I would read about up-and-coming artists. One thing would lead to another; one answered question would cause me to have more questions. From rote memorization and formula-driven learning at school, I was discovering the adventure of self-education. I would start off reading an article about East Coast hip-hop, which is filled with wordplay and vivid street imagery, and be inspired to learn about West Coast &quot;G-funk&quot; music, which is centered on gang violence. From geography, I would delve into history. I would trace the roots of hip-hop back through spirituals and jazz. From the days of slavery to the Civil Rights movement, African-American music had historically expressed a people&#39;s discontent with the civil injustices of their time. Even as the sounds of this music changed, the message remained the same. This was a music that depicted everyday struggles and the aspirations for a new life. It talked about the difficulty of achieving the &quot;American Dream,&quot; of rising from poverty to affluence.Suddenly, I realized that my adventure in learning had brought me somewhere very personal. In the seventies, just as hip-hop was evolving as the forerunner of African-American music, my parents had come to the US to pursue the very American dream that this music was about. And as Asian-Americans, they also faced discrimination based on their race. Everything was connected.While some may view beatboxing as a mere party trick, this style of music-making has taught me something far more significant than the ability to imitate snare drums and hi-hats with my voice. Although this music has recently attained a level of legitimacy among academic and cultural institutions, (researchers at USC study MRI scans of people beatboxing to understand the nature of sound and mental processing in human communication; undergraduates can receive a BA in beatboxing at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama) for me, beatboxing still remains something very personal. It has taught me how to learn. \"}, {\"index\": 866, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Change is my middle name. Figuratively, that is. My parents divorced when I was very young. Understandably, I couldn\\'t choose between living with either of them. So since kindergarten, I have attended nine different schools, trading off between living with each parent every year. Yet, the largest transition in my life came when my mom remarried and moved us to Washington two days before my fifth grade graduation. I had been used to starting new schools, but this was different. I felt vulnerable and isolated in this unfamiliar place. My dad could no longer stop by unannounced to take me out for ice cream. My grandma, who I used to visit nearly every weekend, would now only be seen on holidays. Even the weather was different; the constant rain was a far cry from the Southern Californian sunshine. It was emotionally draining to switch between attending schools in California and Washington every year. I remember the envy that I felt as I watched my best friend\\'s parents attend our middle school\\'s winter concert. By the time I reached high school, I decided to stay in California with my father and attend one high school. I did not foresee, however, the strain that my permanent move would put on my relationship with my mother. I would often go months without seeing my mom. I felt guilty if I did not call daily because I was afraid of losing some irretrievable part of her. When we did visit each other, my mom was often preoccupied because she needed to assist my little brother, Jayden, who has Down Syndrome. I loathed airports because being in a plane meant that I was leaving someone I loved behind. There were times when I needed to motivate myself to get through the day because I just felt so exhausted.Through this adversity, I have developed into a stronger individual, although much of my success is attributed to the support of my family during this tumultuous period. My resilient nature forced me to continue in pursuit of the things that make me happy, despite the emotional burden of the separation from my mom. I found my niche in my Chamber Singers Choir, allowing myself to achieve harmony in both my music and my mind. I also created a club to help other children with disabilities like Jayden. I made amends with my former enemy: the airport. Being in an airport still evokes strong memories of parting from my mother, but I have learned to view it as a place of new beginnings. Moving had been hard when I was young, but I eventually grew stronger. I found a way to make my unique situation work for me. After school, I often called my mom to tell her about my rambunctious puppy or any upcoming tests. I visited my mom every summer, which led to grumbling from my friends, who wanted to spend our summer days on the beach. But they understood that summer was my opportunity to make up for lost time with my mother during the school year.Looking back, I am happy with the decision I made, but I also appreciate my previous nomadic lifestyle. I often longed to see my mom, but had she not moved, I may not have developed my strong sense of independence and adaptability. Yet through all of this, I have learned that these adversities don\\'t define me. I am defined by the strength, confidence, and independence that I have developed despite the difficulties that I have experienced along the way. Change is an inevitable truth in every person\\'s life, and it is the way that stress is dealt with that shows true character. Although I come from a \\'broken family,\\' I am not broken. I have learned to ride the wave of change, without letting it compromise my goals. \"}, {\"index\": 867, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The harsh scent of Windex filled my nose while I whipped the damp paper towel across the arched windows. My mom called out, \\'Camilla, why aren\\'t you finished with the windows. We still have lots of work before we can leave for the day.\\' Hesitantly, I picked up more paper towels to cover with gallons of Windex and quickly finished the rest of the windows until they were crystal clear. My mother, beside me, was sweeping up a combination of dust, dirt and a few bugs here and there, weeks worth of grime buildup. When I finally finished the windows I urged my mother to agree that that the house was clean enough to leave; however apparently it wasn\\'t clean enough to earn my mother\\'s approval. So we kept wiping, sweeping, mopping, vacuuming and sweating. Once the sun began to set, around 7 o\\'clock, my mother decided she was done for the day. However, my day would not stop until sometime past midnight; I still had biology homework to finish.      My parents have always been self-employed, switching jobs every few years. Growing up, I remember my weekends were spent at the local Flea Market where my parents sold clothing, then bamboo for a few years, and then dog clothing. The only weekend I wasn\\'t at work was on Christmas weekend because the Flea Market was closed. When I was 11, I became a miniature sales woman, telling future costumers why they should buy bamboo or how cute their dog would look dressed up in a polka dot skirt. Although the location has changed, I still help my parents work on the weekends and occasionally weekdays. My parents clean and manage vacant real estate properties in addition to the sporadic construction jobs my father does. Instead of engaging in more extracurricular activities or spending time with friends, I now spend most weekend helping my parents clean houses.     Education was never a priority for my parents when they were my age. My father wasn\\'t even able to finish secondary school while he grew up in Mexico because of his economic situation at home. However, now my only priority is to excel in my education. Despite my family\\'s economic and educational circumstances, I am afforded the tremendous privilege of attending a rigorous private school, while on financial aid. My school has not only prepared me for the academics of college but exposed me to the disparity of life with and without higher education, the contrast between the gated communities with mansions that my classmates live in with framed college diplomas hanging on the walls and that of mine, an older, smaller house in a poorer neighborhood. The disparity between the economic lifestyles between my peers and me has not cause any envy nor tension, but has instead made a diverse community where all backgrounds are accepted, a community which I have come to love and look for in higher education. The disparity also caused me to become a more driven student, striving for the academic success that my peers\\' parents had.      My upbringing in an economically disadvantaged household has shaped me into the strong and hard working young adult that I am today. Rather than feeling ashamed of my house or economic status, I embrace my background because through it I have learned that socio-economic status does not define success. I am driven by the strong work ethic my family has instilled in me and determined to bring my family and myself out of economic distress through education and hard work. \"}, {\"index\": 868, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I live in Corona, California; a small city that advertises itself as a bright landmark oncenotable for it\\'s exhilarating racetracks. However, there is neither much excitement in my town,nor is there much to do. On rare occasions, the thrills and action occur at times of congestion onthe 91 freeway, yet that still isn\\'t exciting.    As a high school student, I wondered how I can make a difference on this suburbandullness. Rather than just looking at the high school that I attended, I decided to impactsomething bigger, my community. More specifically, I became motivated to reach out to myentire city by hosting a carnival-themed festival called Sharkfest.    For four months, my life revolved around Sharkfest. I invited members from the CoronaBoard of Education and assigned positions to volunteers. To advertise, I contacted localnewspapers and inserted ads to create awareness for this event. In addition to renting attractionsfrom game companies, I also planned my own games, such as the water balloon toss, that not only fit the theme, but also, were family-friendly. However, this experience was definitely not a flawless journey. I encountered several setbacks along the way. There were many times where businesses never contacted me back as promised, and even in one unfortunate incident, my younger brother accidentally deleted my flyer designs that I labored on for weeks. Yet, these obstacles never deterred me. I deemed them petty and pushed on. I worked days and nights organizing staff positions, checking on decorations, and finalizing everything in order to ascertain the production of this event for my community.       A whopping 2,000 citizens rode on rides, cheered on the fall sports teams, ate delicious foods from food trucks, and generally just had a great time. Compared to the amount of time it took to plan for Sharkfest, the actual event only lasted five hours. Five amazing, unifying, and community fun-filled hours. I took a small idea and let it run its course. As it gained traction, Sharkfest managed to produce precious memories my community could keep for the rest of their lives, and that\\'s what truly makes me proud of my accomplishment. Whether these memories were kept in a photo from the photo booth or a prize from a game, I know that I made a unique experience possible for the people of my city. By leaving a footprint and overcoming obstacles, I was ultimately able to reflect the person I truly am throughout this personal venture, a leader.      I was dissatisfied with the dull atmosphere that consumed my city, so I took a small ideaand ultimately impacted my community through my strong determination and efforts. Althoughmy event may have ended rather shortly, I know this is just the beginning to my future potential.                 \"}, {\"index\": 869, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Everyone has heard the horror stories.These are not whispers about the dusty double doors that lead to a dark labyrinth underneath campus, nor are they the tales outgoing seniors spin about the brutal fatality of financial aid (or, rather, a lack thereof). At my school, the greatest menace students face is United States History, known officially as History 101 and 102.Famed for its crushing rigor, 7-pound textbook, and unforgiving testing calendar, HIS 101/102 is a dual-enrollment course offered to juniors. It\\'s the first college-level class most of us ever take. It\\'s not pretty. The students who sign up are the overachievers, the perfectionists, and the dreamers. We\\'ve always done well in school. We\\'ve constantly succeeded with little effort, and we\\'ve been commended for every A, regardless of how hard we worked for it. In short, this class was boot camp, and we were cocky young recruits about to get a slap in the face.In a few weeks, 30 students who had thought themselves invincible - myself included - could be overheard in the hallways comparing their struggles to painful variations of medieval torture. We wrote eulogies for our GPAs and ordered caskets for each piece of our shattered pride. I found myself trying desperately to keep my head above water. I\\'d never taken a class that had challenged me so fully - academically, emotionally, and psychologically. It wasn\\'t just about switching from a project-based learning style to one founded almost entirely on lectures and notes, or about the hours of heavy reading and vigorous essay writing. This was an entirely different beast.For me, it became a personal crisis of identity. All of who I was - my talents, my accomplishments, and my aspirations - was grounded in academic perfection. Like my classmates, being good at school was just something I did. The day our first quizzes were returned, each with a cold, unforgiving letter in fat red marker on the front page, I left the classroom shaking dazedly, wrestling with the unfamiliar feeling of failure. I kept thinking, \\'Who am I?\\' Who am I that my entire existence can be shattered by a quiz grade? Who am I if that person, someone whose identity rests on something so trivial, is not who I want to be?Over the course of the year, I slowly learned that attaching my self-worth to a grade that often dipped below the autumn temperatures was neither healthy nor wise. To succeed, I needed to shift my focus to myself, not my performance. For the first time in my life, I needed a plan.My grade didn\\'t change overnight when I finally acknowledged my weaknesses and my humanity. As the class progressed, however, I found myself becoming a more skillful writer, a stronger reader, and an increasingly self-conscious and hardworking student - adjectives no one would have used to describe me six months earlier. I practiced, I reviewed, and, most importantly, I gave everything I could. My satisfaction became tied to my honest effort rather than my luck. I grew to know the difference between getting a score and earning one. As I became less concerned with being \\'perfect,\\' I finally found myself able to learn - I mean really learn, not just remember information for an assessment. When I ended the year with a perfect score on the final exam, I knew I\\'d gotten there because of what I\\'d done to prepare, learn, and grow. It was a demonstration of who I had become, not just my raw talent.My final HIS 101/102 grades don\\'t seem that special, but when I see those letters, I feel so incredibly proud of myself and what I was able to accomplish. I worked for those. I earned them. It wasn\\'t about the A, though.

I had always taken it as a compliment without realizing the possibilities for my own pursuits of higher education. Today, both of my parents work in factories because they wanted to be self sufficient despite having little more than a high school education. However, sacrifice for the family has resulted in my father becoming a machine operator and my mother, a packager.

However, as a child, I hardly ever used this phrase. While many children were learning how to add or how to read fairytales, I was focused on the obstacles my family and I were facing not on the difficulties of being left to \\'sink\\' in an English-only classroom, barely keeping my head above water.

Steve Jobs inspires me to change the world every time I listen to his 2008 Stanford Commencement Speech, but my own parents truly epitomize the American dream. My father moved to the United States in hopes of a better education when he was only fourteen. Within four years he was graduating at the top of his class and enrolling in an Ivy League university. My mother sacrificed everything for her children. While learning a new language and acclimating to the new fast-paced world of South Florida, she did everything in her power to ensure that my brother and I took advantage of all the opportunities she never had. 14 years later, it\\'s clear both her and my father\\'s efforts continue to be fruitful.As I grew up, I looked to the words of others for inspiration, but it is one thing to write of strength, love, and compassion, and another to characterize it in all your actions.

As I looked at my mother, she started to cry. 2012 had been a difficult year. My sister had scoliosis surgery two weeks before my visit and my mother was struggling with her recovery. Here came my second defining moment. Do I break down or do I put up a strong front for my mom? I wiped my face and put on a smile as the doctor discussed my treatment plan.Life delivers hope when all is lost. Two months of physical therapy until I could return to cheerleading. I was gaining strength and stability. Pleased with all the progress I had made, Dr. Ashgar cleared me to return to cheerleading. Life tends to drop you when you are feeling high.Cheerleading was wonderful. Every skill was coming to me with such ease. My back felt magnificent and only bothered me on rare occasions. A month later, I returned to Dr. Ashgar. Following his evaluation, Dr. Ashgar informed me that my condition had worsened and I required emergency spinal surgery. I was faced with my third defining challenge. Do I give up or do I keep pushing forward? At this moment, I gave up. Life will let you stay down.I continued to look for the light in the storm, but the closest thing I got was lightning. My surgery was risky. I was facing possible paralysis in my legs. The numbing sensations in my legs were frequent. I had to leave school for an entire month. After my surgery, I was too depressed to be social. I was frustrated that I could not walk or sit without being in pain, that my parents did not understand why I was so upset, and that I could never cheer again. I was faced with my fourth defining challenge; unlike all the other challenges, my mother presented me this challenge. \\'Megan,\\' she said \\'Will you let this keep you down or are you going to push through and come back stronger?\\'Life turns around when you do.I resonated over what my mom told me. If I could walk, run, jump, then I could cheer. The phrase \\'I could\\' soon became \\'I must.\\' Despite the metal in my spine, I refused to give up. Life won\\'t raise you up unless you push it.Today, I am not only a cheerleader, but the captain of Ferguson Cheerleading. Though I had many defining challenges, this was my character defining moment. There were times where I was a settler and I wouldn\\'t allow myself to move forward. However, overcoming spinal surgery, conquering adversity, and returning to cheerleading facilitated my choice. I know exactly what kind of person I am. I am a Riser. \"}, {\"index\": 873, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Numerous elementary and middle students my age were looking forward for the school day to conclude with the final bell. I, however, did not represent the typical student as I dreaded the end of the school day. While my classmates welcomed the afternoon by playing outside and enjoying the day, I would arrive home only to aid my family in our restaurant. Each time I would pass a group of my classmates enjoying the weather on their bikes, playing an imaginary game of war, or in a game of hide and seek as I arrived at the restaurant assisting with the family business. Although my family owned a restaurant business, our unstable financial situation constantly dangled us below the poverty line. The restaurant would often be empty during dinnertime, filled with the dreams and aspirations of our family rather than customers. As a result, I did not receive the luxuries that my peers would consider normal, such as a radio controlled helicopter or a fresh pack of Pok\\\\u00e9mon cards. I did not have the luxury to present my money to the lunch lady during lunch, and instead rather received disapproving and condescending glare for benefiting from the lunch waiver program. Vacation was not something to welcome but rather a distraction that impeded work. I remember the feeling of shame that I received when I did not have the money to attend a field trip in elementary school and stayed behind at school, failing to articulate an explanation in my broken English. My poverty and English skills was quicksand, slowly dragging me down each time I attempted a step towards progress. Despite our impoverished lifestyle, my parents insisted that with labor and persistence, they would eventually strike success. Similar to the multitude of impoverished immigrants before us, my family adamantly believed in the American Dream and that success would be imminent as long as determination and dedication fuel them ignoring the quicksand of poverty that constantly pulled them down. They imparted this cornerstone of the Chinese ethos to me and encouraged me to apply it to my academic endeavors as I struggled with my grasp of the English language. I applied my parent\\'s philosophy in school as I spent extra time and effort receiving instruction in order to enhance my English skills. After a year of toil and dedication, I was deemed advanced in English, a reward as a result of the tireless effort I invested. I finally understood what my parents meant as I saw for myself that dedication and dedication yield success. During my transition into high school, I realized that the Chinese ethos and the American Dream not only complemented each other in their respective beliefs, but they completed each other. The Chinese ethos implanted in me emphasized the importance of dedication and arduous work while the American Dream guaranteed success from persistence regardless of social or financial circumstances. Equipped with both my heritage\\'s beliefs and the ideals of my adopted country, I entered high school with an adamant determination to not let my social and financial situation influence and control my academic potential. Despite not having transportation from and to school, I participated in numerous extracurricular activities such as the yearbook club and the math team, trekking miles home each day in the brutal Wisconsin winter in my determination and dedication to succeed. Furthermore, I obtained a job at another restaurant in order to aid in my family\\'s financial burden and amass money for college, working nineteen hours a week during the school year and full time in the summer. Using the wages I obtained from working, I purchased a plethora of Advanced Placement, SAT and ACT materials to prepare myself for the exam dates. Consequently, I passed all eight of my AP exams in addition to obtaining a 35 on the ACT and a 2170 on the SAT. After obtaining transportation, I had greater access to extracurricular and community service activities as I was elected to the President of student council and became a representative of the Junior Achievement Board. Despite these successes, I still challenge myself to achieve greatness due to my continual belief with determination and dedication, there are no limit to one an individual can achieve. I am looking forward to improve my ACT and SAT score in the fall and preparing for the thirteen Advanced Placement exams I will be taking in May. To this day, I strive to pursue the American Dream through determination and dedication emphasized by my family and culture, challenging myself to continue to achieve. I hope to transfer this persistence mindset to whichever university I will attend the following fall and achieve the highly revered American Dream. \"}, {\"index\": 874, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I watched my parents separate, sickly sweet and sticky, honeyed and viscous torment drawn out in narrow stretches. I watched my grandmother decay and mold into a self-made death bed, sinking in pound by pound, day by day. I watched a house burn down without preamble or ceremony, gone without a single tear to stifle the flames. Escaping unscathed from these moments,I, a na\\\\u00efve child, convinced myself that I was strong, maybe even invincible.\\'So, did Mom tell you?\\' I already know what he\\'s going to say, but I shake my head anyway. \\'I got disqualified from the Marines for a year.\\' The air, already thick with the stale scent of tobacco and gas station food, grows staunchly tight and uncomfortable as I firmly plant my eyes on the dashboard. These moments, when I tiredly decide whether to be surprised or not, drain me to the point of adulthood. Peaking up cautiously, my shoulders slump down to see my brother\\'s eyes on the road. Making the amateur mistake of relaxing, his words catch me off guard. \\'Are you going to say anything?\\'Wringing my hands together silently, I contemplate my answer. I don\\'t know what he wants and I don\\'t know if I\\'m willing to give it to him. My brain groans and sputters as it pushes out recent memories of similar occurrences. Repeated self-sabotages, implosions with his hand on the detonator. Like a circuit breaker overload, a switch snaps into place resolutely. \\'No.\\'My older brother Corrie once told me that only children need heroes. Yet we relentlessly hunt for another mentor, another God, another hero. We slash our way through countless bodies and life becomes a graveyard of forgotten idols. Rarely do we consciously witness a hero\\'s death, deaf to the shattering glass. When I finally allowed myself to hear it though, the occasion wasn\\'t as tragic as I feared. It was freeing.I spent a good majority of my teenage years mirroring my brother\\'s actions. He played baseball, so I started playing softball. He volunteered at the church youth group and soon I was leading the teen group, as well. Though my love for writing remained my own, I didn\\'t embrace it until my brother made his approval known. When adolescence, a time of finding one\\'s identity, frighteningly approached me, I ran under the wings of my mentor.As time passed, however, I came to resemble a child stubbornly holding both hands over her eyes and yelling at the top of her lungs. My interest in softball waned dramatically and I found myself literally dragging my feet to the field. Instead, volunteering clubs drew me in until my schedule revolved around Habitat for Humanity builds rather than softball games.When my junior year arrived, I dropped all athletic pretense and quit softball altogether with a happy flourish. My grades and confidence sky rocketed as I started joining more clubs with my newfound free time. I spent weekends at volunteer events and study groups with friends while my brother remained at home, tapping away at a sullen typewriter in the dark. For someone who prides herself on being acutely perceptive, it took me a year to realize that our roles reversed.Sitting in that car, I listened to my brother recount another self-destructive failure with disillusionment evident in his voice. Despite the lengthy list of amazing qualities he possessed, I knew I couldn\\'t keep looking up to him anymore. I loved him and I respected him, but now it was my turn to be the hero.  \"}, {\"index\": 875, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 876, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Badum\\\\u2026badum\\\\u2026badum\\\\u2026 The bass of a 2008 pop song reverberated against my erratic heartbeat as my sweaty fingertips dragged the mouse across my computer screen. I glanced nervously around the school lunchroom that, despite the noble efforts of the PTO committee, still reeked of steak nuggets and suspicious grape juice. The students of Hutto Middle School quickly claimed the booths along the wall, too embarrassed to be the first to conquer the dance floor. This was my first school dance. Ever. As if that weren\\'t enough to get my eleven year-old blood pumping, I was given the responsibility of controlling the music for the event. Despite my inexperience and unhealthy anxiety, I survived two grueling hours without ruining the occasion for all of my peers.When February came around, I was asked to DJ the Valentine\\'s Day dance. This time, however, the school made me an offer I couldn\\'t refuse: twenty five whole dollars! Tiny, green dollar signs struck my eyes as I planned out my career as a DJ. I went about it like a miniature Donald Trump, designing business cards and taking out a loan from my parents to finance my own sound system. I had monopolized on school dances and then expanded to private birthday parties. I was obsessed, even asking for lighting equipment and a new microphone for Christmas, improving my act. Emily\\'s DJ Service gained momentum, and pretty soon I was landing gigs all over town. Owning my own business as a middle school student required me to accept more responsibilities. I had to earn the respect of adults who were skeptical about trusting a pre-teen with an important job. I found that nothing makes a solid first impression on adults like a firm handshake and a confident voice. I learned the hard language of business and the delicate etiquette surrounding it (such as how to ask politely for the payment and how to not let others take advantage of me). I discovered that actions have consequences, and the consequences of playing an outdated Britney Spears song to a mass of middle school students could be deadly. I honed critical thinking skills and learned how to persevere when my computer crashed on the morning of a half marathon, forcing a last minute scramble to find an alternative music source. While most of my peers were hanging out at Skate Towne or the movie theater, I was creating invoices and tweaking my social media sites. After six years of being behind the DJ booth, I still can\\'t escape the anticipatory flutter in my gut before the driving bass line of the first track spills out of my speakers. I still crave the primitive connection I share with the dancers as I feel their mood shift with each song change. This makeshift, one-woman business has not only become a source of income, but also a vehicle of personal expression in my community and a central part of my identity.  \"}, {\"index\": 877, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] There are lazy brothers, fun brothers, absent brothers, and smart brothers\\\\u2026.but what does it take to be a good brother? Ever since my little sister was born, I have been trying to answer that. And in the process of doing so, I have matured into the person I am today. Being a good older brother is difficult: you have to be exemplary but not overbearing, you have to be a friend but not entirely permissive, you have to be there for them and yet let them make mistakes. You have to be a role model, parent, friend, and tutor all in one. Sarah, my younger sister, was born during a time of change for me. I was about to transfer to a new STEM-oriented school, I had friends that I was going to have to leave, and then my parents drop the bomb on me-I was going to be an older brother in 7 months\\' time. Now my position as favorite child was in jeopardy too. 10 year old Santiago didn\\'t love the idea of a younger sibling. But when I saw my little sister I couldn\\'t help but feel a sense of responsibility. \\'Ugh I\\'m going to be an older brother\\' turned into \\'Yes! I\\'m an older brother!\\'Fast forward 6 years and Sarah is going into first grade. She can easily fill a room with talking, questions, and debates (my parents say that she is just me reincarnated into a girl\\'s body).  She was having trouble understanding some of the new math concepts being introduced to her. Sarah was coming home with tests half complete and losing confidence in her ability as a student. Obviously, she wasn\\'t taking it well; she even asked us to let her skip school on the day of a test. This really troubled me because it meant that Sarah believed that she was a lesser person simply because she could not perform to a standard. I taught Sarah that making mistakes is fine, as long as she adapts herself and moves on from them a better person. We tried approaching the problem differently: I introduced Sarah to visual aids and shortcuts to help her understand the new concepts they were teaching her. End result?  A 97 and one happy girl. Sarah still has trouble with learning something in school every once in a while, but now she simply asks for help and accepts the fact that she will not always know everything. She takes after me in many ways, and I am proud that now she believes that her learning has more value than a number in a gradebook.This entire scenario made me realize that I can make a difference to others. Today, I consider myself a very active teacher and mentor - I love to sit down with a friend and explain a concept that they do not understand. I have been formally involved as a teacher in various programs in high school in the areas of leadership, computer science, math, and especially chemistry. Through my sister, I think that I have been able to take a more mature stance on both learning and my family. She has helped figure out that I enjoy contributing to the success of others.Being a role model for someone else has also made me accountable for my actions. Whatever I do or achieve sets a precedent for what my little sister believes she can do. In this way, I hope to pave my little sister\\'s path and give her even more opportunities than I had myself.  Sarah\\'s birth has made me a more conscientious person and as a result, I constantly remember to be the best version of myself. I have formed many positive attributes and habits because of this tendency and thus I attribute my maturation into an adult to my sister\\'s birth. \"}, {\"index\": 878, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] There is a place, among the hills and dales,Upon a lake, where breezes fill the sails.It seems to be, calling back to me,It\\'s the life for you and it&#39;s the life for me.My buddy come out tonight, the campfire is aglow.No place on earth where truer friends you\\'ll know.I\\'m waiting for the day, when back to you I\\'ll go.Camp Longhorn.- \\'Camp Longhorn Song\\' Camp Longhorn touches individuals with a kind of boundless sunshine despites the miles and years between them. A camper of six years, a counselor of one, I have come to know why so many people refer to camp as their personal heaven on earth. I mean, living with sixteen girls for two weeks in the Texas heat without air conditioning, electronics, or much contact with the outside world may sound like torture to some, but it was here where I learned to be vulnerable, how to speak without fear.  I grew up quiet. Ashamed of the sound of my own voice, I refused to let my words echo and instead let them rebound inside my head. I remember sitting in a classroom, suddenly getting the courage to speak and then being looked at in awe because people had thought I was mute. It was my first year at camp where I finally found my voice. I got off the bus at Burnet, Texas to discover that each girl in my cabin was new to the summer camp experience, and equally terrified. But the atmosphere, electrified with possibility, formed hellos between our lips and followed through with words of friendship. Each one of us born of difference, we still grew intertwined, climbing towards the sun as vines just now receiving the proper care. We slept, ate, played, and lived together; a world of constant laughter and chatter divided up by activities, chow times, and campfires. However, it was in the silence that my cabin developed the ties that keep us together today, and where I found myself. Every Sunday, the tone of camp became pensive as we climbed over boulders of limestone to reach the edge of a cliff, Church Mountain. All of Camp Longhorn watched the sun dip below the Texas hill country in silence so the sky could slowly dim into shades of black and blue. I closed my eyes, then opened them to find the stars glistening through a blanket of night. Three hundred kids and adults sat parallel, inches apart but hands held tight as we listened to the absence of sound. After one week of canoeing, crafting, dancing, and blobbing, the quiet came as a shock. However, testimonies soon began to fill the empty space; each one sharing stories of life, love, and failure followed by thousands of unspoken thoughts. Even us, some of the youngest campers, need not be scolded into silence; the quiet spoke for us. Church Mountain is not about what separates us as individuals-it\\'s about connecting to everyone and everything.  It\\'s difficult to explain, but have you ever felt the edges of your soul fade beyond its boundaries? Have you ever felt as if everything was whole, just for the moment? Have you ever felt that for maybe once in your life, you felt like you belonged? It was this moment, humming along to humanity\\'s tune, that I decided to return the next year, and hopefully for many years after that. In silence I found my voice. \"}, {\"index\": 879, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 880, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'\\\\u00a1M\\\\u00e0s!\\', meaning \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018more\\', was my favorite word as a baby. My intense, enthusiastic persona was obvious from a young age. The first time I slid down a slide, my eyes burst open and I ran to my parents for a hug, demanding \\'\\\\u00a1M\\\\u00c1S!\\'. As years pass, my intensity remains and complements my desire to do my best and share my successes with others.In contrast, \\'She\\'ll never walk, never talk,\\' were the somber words uttered by the doctors when Lorena was born. Yet when I met my little sister, two months and three surgeries later, I na\\\\u00efvely saw no difference between us\\\\u2014she was my new playmate!  Fifteen years have passed, and despite being developmentally delayed, Lorena has made unimaginable progress: she walks, swims, and learned to sing before she could talk. It has become clear that Lorena and I are quite different in terms of our capabilities, but not in terms of our happiness or success. It may take Lorena thirty minutes to get down the bunny hill on the ski slopes, while I hurtle down the black diamonds wanting \\'m\\\\u00e0s\\' speed. However, at the end of the day, when sipping hot chocolate at the lodge, our accomplishments are equally rewarding.Helping Lorena succeed taught me to maintain high expectations for her and celebrate the little steps in achieving each milestone. I applied these lessons when I began volunteering at Backyard Sports (BYS)\\\\u2014a program that provides one-on-one sports coaching to special needs children with a broad range of disabilities. Inspired to help special needs kids in my local community achieve similar success, I created a district chapter of BYS with two friends.We took our vision, some buddies, and a few soccer balls to Central Elementary School on Friday afternoons for a trial run of the program. We paired each high school volunteer with one special needs athlete, who would work together every week. The 1:1 ratio allowed each volunteer coach to modify the activities to cater to their athlete\\'s capabilities. Having his feet strapped into his wheelchair while the other kids were dribbling did not hinder Shauny, an athlete with cerebral palsy, from participating in a soccer session: I handed him a tennis racket, which he used in lieu of his feet to \\'kick\\' the soccer ball.After three months of consistent trial sessions, we solidified the program. I had truly found \\'m\\\\u00e0s\\'! Over the past two years, our club has grown exponentially and surpassed our expectations. At last year\\'s Mamaroneck HS Club Fair, students swarmed the BYS booth, yielding a 100+ volunteer base. It was endearing to see other people so eager to participate in something that I am so passionate about.However, our surplus of volunteers presented us with a dilemma: what would we do with the extra volunteers?The solution came naturally\\\\u2014we expanded our programming and created some large events that integrated the community. Now, every winter, a BYS team consisting of high school volunteers and special needs athletes runs in the local Turkey Trot and raises money for the Special Education PTA. We also coordinated a fundraiser basketball tournament at the Knicks Training Facility, where the special needs athletes played a halftime scrimmage. I am proud to see the culture toward special needs in my school and community being influenced by BYS. In a town where people are constantly rushing and competing, we created an environment where we celebrate patience, positivity, and perseverance, where there is a team bond between mainstream and special needs athletes, and where everyone\\'s successes are equally valued. Whether sports or special needs related, the community constantly reaches out to BYS for \\'m\\\\u00e0s\\'.As high school graduation approaches, we are training the next round of leaders to ensure that the BYS legacy continues. And as I enter the next stage of my life, I will carry the lessons I have learned through Lorena and BYS in my pursuit for \\'m\\\\u00e0s.\\'  \"}, {\"index\": 881, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Scuff, scuff, scuff. Another half hour of swinging my trusty pickax at the hard, dry dirt and I need a break. Breathing a frosty cloud into the Saturday morning air, I peer at the net and imagine a perfect play - pass, set, kill - as a smile illuminates my face. Schlip. A sip from a thermos of warm ginger tea fuels a mental review of the day\\'s schedule: studying, volunteering at the old nun\\'s home, then lion dance practice, more homework, my nightly hour of prayer, a call to my mother, and, at last, sleep.But the volleyball court comes first.Thwuck. Digging again, my body persistent, continuous in the motion. This is the third time this week I have tilled the dirt to prevent the dangerous accumulation of dust on this peculiar soil, which is both fine and clumpy and threatens slipping feet and turned ankles. I know the others won\\'t play if they have to worry about twisting a ligament, so I keep at it. Thwuck, thwuck, tack. I\\'ve hit a rock. A big one. \\'Not the first rock I\\'ve plowed through building this court,\\' I think wryly.It started with the recognition of a problem. Our school\\'s volleyball court was an unkempt, thistle-infested lot with a sagging net. There were only three balls, pitted and scarred beyond recognition. Students avoided the court and hoped for rain on volleyball days during P.E. class. Volleyball may have been my passion, but no one else shared it, largely because of the disrepair of the facilities and equipment.Not for long.Ouch. Soreness is already setting in, but my mind escapes into memory, back to the painstaking, rewarding steps taken to build this court, this program, from the ground up: installing a second net, dangerously feisty, onto fragile wooden poles, hammering boundary lines into the dirt, wrenching thorny star thistles from the soil, re-tightening every week the nets that refused to stay taut, waiting tables over the summer to buy materials and new balls. \\'Labor of love\\' may be an understatement.Schuuuuuuck. My metal rake combs the dirt back into place, prepared for flattening by stomping feet and cheery voices. The job is nearly done. I remember buying my first batch of volleyballs: fresh, blue and white Spalding TF-5000\\'s, ten in total. \\'New ball? Hey, let\\'s go try it out\\', I\\'d overheard as I pulled on my shoes and did a little jig of joy.Crunch, crunch.

My autistic brother also covered his ears with an expression of fear. Tears were running down his face and he started to whimper. I could not imagine what was going through his 4-year old mind, so I hugged him tightly and didn\\'t let go.Why me? I constantly asked myself this question as I went day in and day out hearing my parents fighting over the pettiest subjects: \\'No, you cannot buy him those sneakers.\\' My dad said. My mom replied, \\'Why not!\\' My dad asserted, \\'Because I said so!\\' Ironically, my home was not a sanctuary for me to escape the troubles that bothered me, but was an unrelenting battleground that further exacerbated my stress in which the bullets were the words that pierced my mind on a daily basis, leaving me with the constant fear that my parents would divorce and a distorted misconception that parents normally acted this way. For that reason, education was not a priority in the household, and their constant bickering would entangle me in situations that made it difficult for me to focus on school-related matters. Regardless, my mom and dad unconditionally loved me, even if they didn\\'t get along.Being immigrants, my mom and dad had to work hard and study diligently in their respective countries, Nicaragua and Hungary, to go to the United States, so they could provide my brother and me a suitable environment for us to live in. My dad, who lived in poverty for most of his life, went to Russia for five years to pursue his economics degree. There, he coincidentally met my mom and they got married in Moscow. After the marriage, they decided to leave Moscow and go to California. However, when my parents were informed that my 2 year old brother was diagnosed with autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by difficulties in social interaction and impaired verbal communication, they had to stop all the progress they made with their career plans.I, just 4 years old, was not aware of the differences between having an autistic brother and a normal brother, but as I grew older and started attending elementary school, I soon started to realize what it was like to have a younger, autistic brother. It hit me when I was walking to school with my elementary school friends and they asked me, \\'Why is your brother not normal; He makes weird sounds when we talk to him.\\' That day I realized the subtle differences between my brother and my friends\\' siblings. Unlike my friends who had siblings that would play with them and do \\'normal\\' sibling activities, I had to carve out personal time to help my parents teach my brother the simplest tasks. This, nonetheless, didn\\'t stop me from bonding with my brother. In contrast, this helped me start the maturing process much earlier than my peers, and acquainted me with the responsibilities that are usually given to adults. In addition to taking care of my brother, I had to cast away the pleasurable diversions like going to the theaters and going to the concerts because my brother would get agitated by the deafening volume and music. Although I did find this burdensome when I was growing up, I now realize how much I have learned from having to take care of my brother and the rewards of having a disabled sibling. Every time I play tennis, study for exams for hours on end, and do other activities, I have the thought of my brother in the back of my head, inspiring me to strive to do the best in anything I decide to pursue. \"}, {\"index\": 883, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] How many people would hand a knife to a seven-year-old and say, \\'Here, cut your apple\\'? Knives hurt, and in a child\\'s hands, knives are a recipe for disaster. However, having a knife in my hand didn\\'t worry me or make me feel as though I would cause trouble, because my mom was there to support me and guide me. As she watched over me, I grew more and more confident in my ability to chop my apple. As I cut it, I could feel the somewhat slick, crunchy feeling of the apple under my tiny hand - I knew I could do it. I knew that the knife wouldn\\'t slip and I wouldn\\'t accidentally cut my childish fingers. I knew what to do and I knew I could do it, and all because my mom taught me how; her presence gave me courage. It made me feel strong, important, and responsible. I had a sharp, dangerous instrument in my uncoordinated hands and it was up to me to control it, to maneuver it in such a way so as not to hurt myself. A knife is an adult tool, and holding one in my hand with my mom there made me feel like an adult.And then one day she wasn\\'t there to watch over me and I knew that her presence would not be in the kitchen with me anymore. She was gone. I had a knife in my hand, an apple in front of me, but no mom to watch over me, to be there to guide me. I was a child again, not the strong adult I pretended to be. I had no idea what to do and whether or not it would be okay because she wasn\\'t there to give me advice. I remembered everything she taught me, yet I still hesitated. I went to my dad and asked him to cut my apple for me.When he came with me to the kitchen, he told me that he knew that I knew what to do and that I could do it. He told me to cut the apple and left me to my own devices, trusting me to do it correctly, giving me the faith I had denied myself. Hesitantly, I cut an apple for the first time since my mom died, and suddenly I was an adult again. I knew that I had the strength and ability to slice my own fruit and that I didn\\'t need my mom\\'s presence anymore. I knew that I could be an adult all by myself. \"}, {\"index\": 884, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] At seven o\\'clock Sunday night, I was surrounded by almost one hundred thirty 2.5 inch square cookies, which were due the following day. Only a dozen had been iced, and I was already getting tired. I had been working since eight that morning. I had never made sugar cookies with royal icing before, so if I messed anything up, I would fail my chemistry project. Although I only received four hours of sleep that night, I didn\\'t mess up. Give or take a few extra cookies that were covertly hidden away in my stomach, my project was perfect. I had been persistent and determined to do the best job possible. Instead of giving up and turning in mediocre work, I made sure I finished my two-week long cookie escapade with A+ work. My classmates quickly devoured the one hundred eighteen intricately frosted cookies shaped and decorated as the periodic table of elements.A lot of my time is spent on my school work. I am one of those students who love school. I love the aspect of just learning something new, and being educated. I strive to be the best, not for my parents or for college, but for myself. I have pride in myself, and my work. My parents are not very educated, and they have never cared much about my grades. My father is unemployed due to an injury, and my mother works extra to make up for the lost income. She took a job that she hated over one she loved so that she could earn more for us. She has recently returned to that previous job, and I am proud of her for it. However, I still go to my own conferences. When I receive an A+ in class, I know I do it only for myself. I want to have better opportunities in life.In my free time, I like to bake. I have had many fleeting passions, like wanting to be a couture fashion designer, a lawyer, a crocheter (because knitting was too hard at age ten), an actress, or a world-renowned architect. However, baking has really stayed with me in the last several years. I took a cake decorating class at a local store. It inspired me to try to create a three layer vanilla cake with a beautiful ombr\\\\u00e9 purple Swiss meringue buttercream frosting for my twin and I\\'s birthday. I also created chocolate fudge malted cupcakes for my business teacher for her birthday. My craziest creation has to have been the S\\'mores cupcakes I made for my Advanced Placement Biology class on a free day. They had a graham cracker cake, with a fudgy ganache dollop and a fluffy white marshmallow frosting, all from scratch. We used the teacher\\'s blowtorch (don\\'t tell the Principal!) to create a golden brown crust on the marshmallow frosting. I also baked six dozen assorted cupcakes for my school\\'s National Honor Society\\'s Teacher Appreciation. The theme was a picnic, so a few had fake plastic ants, some were corn on the cob, a few sunflowers, and then some mini cherry pies. Baking is where I can show the more creative side of me, since I put so much stress on science in my schedule. Baking is chemistry!I love creating things for others to enjoy. Seeing the expression on my business teacher\\'s face when I handed her a half dozen cupcakes was priceless. She even asked me which bakery I had gotten them from! I hope that one day I will be able to start my own cupcakery and share my success with everyone. Baking provides me with a change of pace in my always busy schedule. It becomes a stress reliever, and helps me think about things other than that one question I missed on my calculus test. The bonus is that after everything is said and done, I get the pleasure of eating everything! \"}, {\"index\": 885, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] During the months before I was born, my father was convicted of drug-trafficking, plunging my family into a state of chaos further complicated by my imminent arrival. My mother charioted my sister and me back and forth in a beat-up \\'84 Toyota from our home on the outskirts of Miami to a prison visitation-room until his deportation to his native Colombia. These vaguely recollected events would cause deep rippling effects that would pervade my development into who I am today.Despite the troubled conditions surrounding the beginning of my life, those crucial formative years following his deportation were essentially positive, associated with the transformation that came once my mother, sister, and I joined my entire extended family on my aunt\\'s paso fino horse ranch, with the home of another aunt close enough to run to barefoot. Recently, reading Dylan Thomas\\'s poem, \\'Fern Hill,\\' named for where the poet spent his summer holidays, I was filled with nostalgia for the green pastures of my childhood. His descriptions of himself as \\'green and carefree\\' among the apple-trees and horses, reminded me of my own days of pure, youthful ecstasy- climbing kingdoms of trees with my sister, following my uncle Jairo around as he fed the horses, and boldly swinging on a bright, rainbow hammock. When, a few years later, my mother moved us up to Ocala, Florida, I found myself a world away from the green acres that had been my personal version of Thomas\\'s Fern Hill.In our solitary band of three, Mami worked tirelessly as our sole provider, leaving me to draw closer to my big sister Gabby.Though only two years older than me, she half-raised me, acting as my best friend and caretaker, cooking and cleaning like an adult, while I trailed behind her, a shadow mimicking her every action. Gabby is the one who taught me to read, and , through it, we developed our own special bond. Side-by-side we would walk out of the local library, dwarfed by the precarious tower of books we would insist on carrying out ourselves. Given that we didn\\'t have cable, our options were to either read or watch the \\'Price is Right\\' marathons. We chose reading.By the time I had started at Hawkes Bluff Elementary, I had decided there could be no differences that could separate us. Entering young adulthood, I realized I couldn\\'t plagiarize Gabby\\'s identity as my own forever. I stepped off her blazed trail, and learned that I had my own natural gifts. Unlike Gabby, I wasn\\'t destined to become a varsity swim team captain; but that was fine, because I found that I loved singing and playing piano. In these and other ways, I had discovered that I had my own interests to pursue: a realization that was revolutionary to me.Armed with a new found self-awareness, I began high school ferociously, seeking out who I was. Looking back to my freshman year, I am amazed at the person I was only four years ago. I was friends with my entire class, and willingly sat through every football game. Scrawled across every club sign-up sheet was my name in flowery cursive. Unknowingly, I had fallen into one of the classic traps of adolescence. Much to my freshman self\\'s chagrin, I was not actually passionate about gaming and art club. Scrupulously, I carved out my own identity from the chaotic mess I\\'d thrown myself into, developing into someone I recognized as me. As far as I have come, I still have plenty of growing left to do. I\\'m still trying to find balance, but I now know I can overcome pitfalls along my journey. Like all lives, mine is an evolution. My dreams, my failures, my successes, and my innermost desires are all made up of the imperceptible changes happening everyday. But these slight changes are pieces coming together to become the transformations that ultimately make \\'me.\\' \"}, {\"index\": 886, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Since I first learned to add and subtract, I have been pummeled with the notion that life is a numbers game, that school is where we go to become masters of math and science, that the only prerequisite to a fruitful life is an academic education. The day I joined Key Club was the day I realized how incorrect my teachings have been.  Over these past four years I\\'ve learned to develop skills in leadership, give back to others and the community, and create lasting bonds with my peers. These experiences have played a defining role in shaping who I am and how I view life. When I first joined this service organization in 9th grade, I didn\\'t understand the allure. It had nothing to do with the math and science I was taught to idolize, nor did my parents approve of me \\'wasting\\' my time volunteering. Key Club presented me with a \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018red pill, blue pill\\' moment. I opted for the red pill and after a gulp and a breath, escaped into another world. Suffering from clinodactyly and a pronounced lisp, growing up I often felt a form of social anxiety stemming from my physical presentation. I would refuse to talk to people, refuse to make any friends, because I was so afraid of being criticized. Key Club forced me into a new world, one in which I had to forgo my insecurities and inadequacies to move forward with any task. At one of my very first volunteer events, I found myself amidst welcoming and unique individuals who took no hesitation to adopt me into their family. This may seem commonplace, but for an isolated high school student with little to no experience at social interaction, this was akin to being thrown into the deep end without knowing how to swim. As I grasped at straws trying to think of what to say and what to do, I learned to swim, in fact I swam far out of my comfort zone, actively socializing and enjoying it.From community beautification projects and charity fundraisers to spirit rallies and banquets, every event I participated in since then worked to forge a bond between me and my fellow Key Clubbers. No longer did I want to hide in the shadows, alone and afraid. My veins surged with newfound love: a love for my community and a love for my fellow student.I soon became the Vice President of my school\\'s Key Club and adopted a role as Club Editor so I could encourage other students like me to explore the world Key Club has to offer. The leadership, communication, and management skills I\\'ve learned have shown me paths I never knew existed, all leading to the person I am today.  Every facet of my high school experience has been influenced by the growth Key Club has initiated.I believe I am a more sympathetic person than I was when I first stepped foot onto my high school campus. I am no longer the selfishly cold and analytical student who thought only of how I could benefit myself. I\\'ve learned to see a world apart from the mathematical and scientific. The changes to my life Key Club has allowed me to make have facilitated my attempts to design a future of my own creation. I\\'ve changed my outlook on life to fit the person I want to be and the world in which I want to live. In a mere four years, I was able to overcome some of my greatest fears and discover a new side to life. I hope to apply the lessons of my past and present to create a meaningful future dedicated to those I love. Key Club has taught me that life is more than a numbers game. A person\\'s development is for the most part shaped by his/ her environment. My environment consists of the people around me, namely my family. I\\'ve seen through my parents\\' lives and my own life that change is a powerful and radical force that can bring dreams to fruition and create some of life\\'s greatest joys. I aspire to save and more importantly change lives via a medical career. I hope that one day I can attain the ability to improve the lives of those around me while at the same time, improving my own.Born in a rural farming community of Michigan isolated from any activity, I had few opportunities to further my education. Realizing this, my parents took a leap of faith, migrating to California and leaving behind our perfectly stable lives in favor of the unknown. In their attempts to provide me with a better life, they inadvertently gave me two wonderful role models as well.  Reflecting on the risks my parents took and the changes they incurred encouraged me to do the same. I aspire to emulate my parents and build an even brighter future for my family and my community. I want to attempt to change the world and in the process, succeed in my endeavors to change someone\\'s world.My parents enlightened me of the gratification that comes from change, hard work, and perseverance. As they struggled and succeeded in making a living in the US after emigrating from India, I too hope to vanquish my dragons with just as much passion and ambition. I\\'ve learned to see the world through others\\' eyes, to push well past adversity so I can find a better world for those I love.In every way, I hope to inherit the traits and qualities of my parents. I hope to be as hardworking, caring, influential, and determined as my parents have been, to take risks and shoot for the stars, to be an inspiration to myself and my community.My ambition is to build upon my parents\\' dreams. Just as my parents lived to change my world, I want to live to change the worlds of others. I exist today because my parents risked life and limb to create my world, change its course from what it would have been to what it is now, remove the pain and struggles I would have suffered in favor of love and opportunity. I owe my past, present, and future to my family and every step I take, I take to repay them. \"}, {\"index\": 887, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Growing up, the first thing I did when I got home from school was read the newspaper.  I wish I could say I was interested in Middle Eastern policy and the Dow Jones, but the truth is I only wanted the sports section.  I would flip to the second page and note the time and station of that night\\'s Angels\\' game; minutes before the opening pitch, I would pull up a chair and sit about 5 feet away from the flat screen TV in my living room.  I could recite the Angels\\' batting order from memory and learned each player\\'s home run total from the year before (batting average had a couple too many digits for me to recall).  Likewise, much of my time was spent playing and contemplating baseball.  My weekends revolved around Little League; if I had an early morning game on Saturday I would be disappointed, as I couldn\\'t spend time looking forward to the game.  After the age of 8, I was unable to play catch with my family, so my dad bought a bounce-back.  This contraption was foolproof, an aluminum frame with netting pulled taut across it.  My father and I built the bounce-back together in the garage, placing it in our driveway.  Unfortunately for my parents, this meant our driveway would no longer be used for cars, but rather for hours of throwing and fielding until it became too dark to see.  With the help of my newfound partner, I developed and mastered basic techniques of the game.  After graduating from Little League and moving into Pony, I found that my hard work with the bounce back had paid off: I was constantly in the field and one of the better defenders on my team.  Unfortunately, my place in the batting order slowly fell, as I wasn\\'t able to adjust to a larger field and bigger opponents.  After a year of frustration and disappointment, the realization struck that even with my craze for baseball, I would see less and less of the field I loved.  Rather than break my heart slowly, I decided to do it overnight.  Going into high school, I traded in a baseball diamond for a volleyball net.  After my first volleyball practice, it dawned on me just how unprepared I was.  There were full-grown 18 year-olds towering over my 6-foot frame, and others who looked like they could snap me in half and eat me whole.  Despite my initial inhibitions, the more I played, the more I enjoyed the sport.  I began to play outside of practices: I would go to my old elementary school and hit against the backstops, pass against my garage (much to the dismay of my parents), and was rarely found without a volleyball.  However, as my physical skills developed, my knowledge of the game began to lag.  The varsity players I admired and coaches who counted on me were literate in a language I didn\\'t know existed.  I began to pay more attention to the mental aspect of the game: the positioning, the rules, the verbiage.  My go-to learning strategy became watching professional volleyball.  Unfortunately, volleyball\\\\u2014despite what many believe\\\\u2014doesn\\'t have a huge presence on national television, so it was difficult to.  I resorted to watching videos of elite players online, and attempted to emulate them.  While I have yet to reach the prowess of these professionals, my abilities as a volleyball player improved dramatically as I developed from a gangly freshman into an All-league player.My passion for sports has challenged me both physically and mentally: showing me not only the value of hard work and the joy of success, but also the realities of my own limitations and the pain of failure.  As I move into the next stage of my life, I know further challenges will push me to grow and achieve new heights I have yet to dream of. \"}, {\"index\": 888, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Growing up in a household comprised of a single parent and an older sibling has definitely been a major contributor to my desire to succeed in life. Following my parents\\' divorce, at a young age, I was forced to move into a new country, taking a giant leap forward at a time when most other kids\\' \\'great leaps\\' consisted of choosing which toy they would play with that same afternoon. From that point on, my life has never been the same. We were constantly moving around from house to house until we finally found a real home. Being unfamiliar with everything -from the language to the culture- I had no sense of self. I had abandoned everything that was concrete in my life -my newly acquired childhood- for the simple promise of an American Dream.          Ever since I was a little kid, I have highly valued education because I truly believe that knowledge can lead to great things. Therefore, I have always sought to do all that I possibly can to perform well in school. This was initially a problem for me, however, as I attended three different schools within the short period of my first six months in the country. The first school only saw me for one week; the second school saw me for a semester; the third school saw me finally settling in what would become my home school from elementary all through high school. This transition from a nomadic lifestyle to a more sedentary one provided me with an idea of what my goals were, where I was going to achieve them, and how I was going to accomplish them. In a sense, it was my transition from a helpless, extinct Cro-Magnon to a Homo Sapiens with a future ahead.          There were often times when our financial situation was so surreally low, that I wondered what \\\\u2013 if anything \\\\u2013 we were going to eat. As a result, my mother was forced to work two and even three jobs to provide for my sister and me, which resulted in me only seeing my mother in the mornings (while she slept) when I got ready to walk to school and occasionally on the weekends (if she had the day off). Eventually growing tired of all the hardships that presented themselves one after  the other, I promised myself that one day I would be able to care for my mother, and reciprocate all the time she had spent on me, all the hardships she had endured for me, and all the sacrifices she had made for my well-being.           As for my older sister, she has always been there for me, supporting me when I have had any major athletic and academic events. She has even been there for me during times when I have felt that I had no one to talk to. However, I have never really seen her as a role model, as she breezed through her high school years not putting much effort, thinking that life would always wait for her; she ended up in community college and (though there is really nothing wrong with that) that is not the goal I have set for myself.           Many times, friends have asked \\'Why? ...\\' Why do you try so hard? Why did you exchange your social life for school? Why do you break your back so often just to get better grades than other people? I have not once answered such questions because they undeniably deserve no response, because well... I have done so to ensure that someday I can go to college and receive a higher education. I have done so to ensure that this \\'higher education\\' will provide me with the opportunities to obtain a job that I hope to enjoy. I have done so to ensure that when I am out \\'in the real world\\' I can be happy with my life and with all the decisions I have made. I have done so to help others. To help my mother. To help myself. \"}, {\"index\": 889, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Debate, at 400 words per minute, is ludicrous, incomprehensible and counterintuitive to an outsider, but not to me. To me, it is a hub of constantly refreshing ideas that stretch my mind and force it to quickly grasp concepts previously unheard of. Yet, I am still in charge. In debate, I am a researcher who strives to become an expert. I am a policymaker who deliberates over consequences and its philosophical underpinnings through calculations of risks, costs and benefits. Here, I explore unrestricted by a course\\'s curriculum and play with scenarios of global nuclear war, economic depression, and environmental collapse.  Here, I have a place to research what intrigues me, and convey my advocacies in a forum where people listen. In the competitive realm, the roads to victory are infinite, but my goal is to find the most innovative path. Through hours of research, I learn the intricacies of a concept, craft a strategy laden with traps, and attempt to foresee my opponent\\'s actions. Today, I advocate for increased port dredging. My opponent introduces evidence regarding the negative environmental ramifications of port dredging, but after examining it closely, I\\'ve figured out the strengths and weaknesses of this article. I will grill my opponent with questions, but these questions are different. I know the answer already, but I want him to tell me it so I can hold him accountable, and use it to my advantage. Today, I\\'m the expert, and I can explain port dredging and its benefits with passion. The ideas that we talk about in debate: space elevators, deep-sea mining, or intercontinental high-speed rails seem both technologically and politically infeasible now, but it\\'s precisely this mindset that precludes them from happening. Debate\\'s deliberative process allows me to envision what tomorrow could be. Although in debate rounds, when we \\'enact policies\\' as the federal government, nothing actually happens on Capitol Hill, change is still happening elsewhere. I\\'m becoming a better advocate. I\\'m learning to defend my position more effectively, improve it, and refute others. I learn the in\\'s and out\\'s of persuasion, and become a better thinker. We may not have these technologies today, but one day, I\\'ll be the one presenting my own engineering idea, and I\\'ll be ready. It\\'s a reflective process: through wins and losses, I\\'m able to uncover alternate viewpoints, expand on my own, and challenge others. The first debate argument I was introduced to was whether or not global warming was real, anthropogenic, and destructive. Having been educated on the dangers of global warming, I came in with a dismissive mindset and thought to myself, \\'Of course it\\'s real and bad!\\' Yet, as I began reading about the controversy, I began to reconsider my position on the issue, rather than blindly accepting everything that is given to me. I began to have more questions about the world and now, I am always observing. I observe myself, the communities that I belong to, as well as the world that I live in.  I can now reexamine the world through the lens of Marx\\'s theory of historical materialism; I have the ability to question the free market, the hegemonic showcase of the U.S.\\'s dominance, and the looming threat of climate change. I can now distinguish the scare tactics from the data itself and have a dose of healthy skepticism regarding everything I see.  Events are constantly happening in the world, and although sometimes they may be happening thousands of miles away from me, they are still important, and shape the world that we live in today. While there are objective truths in the world, grounded in empirical, scientific evidence, there are many more things that are subjective, up for discussion, and can be changed.  \"}, {\"index\": 890, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] How much does the moon influence your weight? What path does a boomerang take? Questions like these run through my mind like squirrels through a forest; and I take it to myself to explore them. Finding and solving real world problems make up who I am. Exploratory endeavors outside of school are staples to my education, teaching me lessons that I would not otherwise learn. One example of my many adventures started in chemistry class with a lecture about Graham\\'s law of effusion.Curiosity naturally made me question the practical uses of Graham\\'s law. I thought of applications like oxygen tanks and pneumatically powered projectiles, but it dawned upon me that many require an equation for absolute rates, whereas Graham\\'s law only provides a relative relationship. To quench my thirst, I set my sails, yet again, in search of knowledge - this time for an absolute effusion rate equation. I sure spend a lot of time sailing.After a couple days of frustrated thinking and fruitless research, I was stuck. In school, the information we need to know is contained in the chapters outlined in class, but to solve a real-world scenario, information has to be drawn from an unspecified range of sources. To solve my effusion problem, I had to first backtrack and consider all the different ways to view the problem. I thus learned another valuable lesson from my journey to add to my collection: taking some time to gather a variety of possible solutions can pay off in the long run.For full satisfaction, I wanted to confirm my solution by testing it in the real world. Drawing inspiration from a beloved pastime, I came up with the fun and economic idea to use my paintball gun as the \\'scientific instrument\\' of choice. (I calculated the effusion rate of CO2 by measuring paintball airtime and thus exit velocity to determine CO2 cartridge pressure.) I was ecstatic to find that my equation had correctly predicted the relationship between effusion rate and time. No textbook had ever produced such a joyous motivation!In the weeks following, I shared a potential application of my findings with friends, family, and teachers - in particular a group of paintball enthusiasts. They had been frustrated with the problem that, as more shots were fired, paintball velocities diminished. I explained my equation so they could give it a shot (or better yet, a cartridge\\'s worth of shots). I produced a spreadsheet to determine the relationship between velocity and number of shots fired to better evaluate when to replace the CO2 cartridge. The beauty of my spreadsheet lay in its adjustability to different power and gun preferences. This way, there was no need to test every single gun\\'s shot power over time. Impressed with the applicability of physics, several paintballers even ended up researching their own ways to optimize performance such as temperature control! In utilizing my tool, they saved time on the battlefield and money in testing materials, and even learned a bit of physics in the process.My journey in the exploration of effusion started with a natural curiosity, followed a design-test-apply process, and concluded with a new toolset of equations, concepts, and techniques. Interest-driven, out-of-school experiments such as this one make up a large part of my character. Thinking in unexpected ways, collaborating with friends, and drawing from interdisciplinary fields comes naturally to me. A backyard project of this magnitude may not be game-changing, but in the future, with more knowledge and resources, I hope to carry out more serious, far-reaching research. The world\\'s an oyster and I\\'m eager to open it. \"}, {\"index\": 891, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] As the clock ticks past five, I leave behind the busy world and retreat to the paradise behind my neighborhood \\\\u2013 dirty, rocky trails.  This is where I bid farewell to my everyday engagements \\\\u2013 homework, texts, essays.  It\\'s my time, my escape, and I\\'m smiling. The first two miles are always the most difficult.  Blood begins draining from my organs, flowing to my limbs, leaving my unconscious wondering where the AC went.  My breath becomes labored, the warm Santa Ana air burning deep in my lungs.  As I settle into mile three, I hit a rhythm, striding begins to feel more like gliding.  Step-by-step I climb up the hills and maneuver around obstacles \\\\u2013 a broken tree branch here, a dried-out creek bed there.  The occasional dust rises up, coating my legs a shade darker.  I push on, continuing away from the bustle of every day life.  Mile four, my breathing slows \\\\u2013 only deep, calm breaths now.  A physics problem I was stuck on drifts into my head.  I chew on it as formulas float through my mind.  Why was I stuck?  It\\'s been another mile now.  I continue to work, mind and feet moving at the same speed.  It clicks why I was baffled, a careless error \\\\u2013 I transposed an easy formula.  Mile six, this far out on the trails and the only sound one hears is the rustle of a bird in a passing bush.  Being far removed from the city, it\\'s peaceful.  Looking behind me, I can see fragments of I-5 out in the distance, as a trail of lights and smog hover above, marking its path.I roll into mile seven, the end of isolation, today\\'s therapy session almost complete.  It\\'s my last climb before I reach the sleepy roads of my neighborhood.  Shadows have grown long.  I take in the quiet trees rustling in the wind, and note how well I fit with the scenery.  My skin is the color of clay, and my blonde hair has lightened even more from the hour in the sun.  The sky has turned pastel and the air is now heavier, cooler, as the marine layer sets in.  Less than a mile to go, I stride pass my school, a consuming symbol for my life.   I know I\\'ll soon be home, re-engaging with my schoolwork, picking up with my life as I left it.  It\\'s easy to get caught up in my perceived daily troubles, and without any escape, it would consume me.  That\\'s what I love about running; connecting with the natural world keeps me balanced, it lends perspective.   \"}, {\"index\": 892, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] As I roll the final G chord and let it ring, I savor the serenity that fills the room. At my piano is where I am perfectly content. A picture of my closest friends sit to my right to remind me someone will always be there for me. A bag of Hershey Kisses is beside me to sweeten the bitter blocks that sometimes make their way into my mind. To my left sits a stack of song-filled notebooks of which no one could ever replace. Underneath me, I feel the comfort of my beautiful, quilted cover. Although it may seem petty, the encouragement it gives me is indescribable. It was my piano teacher\\'s favorite, but she felt that I needed it much more in my life. There is a key that sticks only if the soft pedal is pressed. I only use the soft pedal when I don\\'t want my mother to hear me play, so that single key encourages me in its own way to not suppress my thoughts and feelings.To escape from the pain and heartache that plagues daily life, people turn to alcohol, drugs, and even self-abuse. I turn to playing music. Piano has been an emotional lifeline for me throughout the seemingly countless years of custody disputes, financial stresses, and lack of parental support. Not having the opportunity to be an older sister to my three younger siblings causes extensive heartache for me. The mistakes of my father has made the simple joys of showing love for my siblings and having a childhood free of conflict, impossible for me to reach. Tears streaming, I often find myself running to my piano when I get home. It is there that I play incessantly. It is there that I enter my happy place; a place where I forget everything that is going on and just relax. It is a gradual change. To start, I strain to see through the tears to play. I choke out the words to songs I have scribbled down over the years. As the minutes turn to hours, the screams turn to soft whispers. It is such a perfect time of playing, every time. I write songs seated here. Composing is my own way of expressing all the thoughts I am too afraid to say. In the notebooks filled with songs, my every emotion is visible. Some verses have nearly unrecognizable handwriting with one word taking up a quarter of the page, depicting the lack of mental stability I had at the time. As the resolution of my song comes into focus, my writing neatens. Through the mood of the music, I can literally feel the calm overcoming the song. At times, when the tears choke me to the point I cannot squeeze out a word, I love to return to the classical songs. Some I play so often, the presence of my mind is not required for the movement in my fingers. Even though my eyes are blurred, the music still flows unclouded, crisp, and clear. The beauty in that is unlike anything I could ever describe with words. Even though I am not mentally present to support myself, my piano stands strong beside me. It soaks up each and every one of my tears and uses them to water the seeds of inspiration I wish to plant in the hearts of others through my pieces. Where am I most content? My mind does not even wander for a moment. My beautiful Baldwin in all of its scratched and aged splendor immediately enters my mind. Music opens that gateway of peace and concord for me, and for that I will be forever grateful. \"}, {\"index\": 893, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Ting! Metal clanks against metal, voices chirp like content cicadas. Sitting on a rough, navy blue rug, I find myself looking up at people of different ages, excitedly talking and sharing stories as they wait for the usual routine: football. Every Friday during the fall, we gather in this room and await orders to get dressed, sit in our sections, and be ready to perform. The room perpetually buzzes with excitement and anxiety, as many of our first-timers worry about making some sort of spectacle of themselves on the field. We veterans find it amusing, but we can\\'t just let them stay upset about their first game. Walking around, we offer some words of advice, pats on the back, and even some of our first football game stories to try to ease their tension before going back to sitting in our sections. Sitting on this rough rug, after three years of Marching Band, it suddenly hits me how much I love the band room and every memory our band makes before each football game. No matter where anyone comes from, what they love to do outside of music, or what kind of life they lead, this band room never fails to turn strangers into a tight-knit family. Looking up around the room, my eyes catch a tall wooden trophy placed perfectly centered among hundreds of brightly colored smaller ones, which line each wall of the band room on high shelves. It reminds me of my first musical award, one which I thought I didn\\'t earn. I remember sitting in the auditorium, on a blue plastic chair, in concert band format. Aside my French Horn section, names began being called out into the microphone, honoring those who participated in Marching band my freshman year. As I sat in my chair, I watched band members get up and walk proudly to the band director as he pinned a medal onto the right breast. One by one, each person got up, until finally, my section came next. I felt awkward, considering I started band my freshman year during concert band, not marching. Surprisingly though, I heard my name boom from the speakers and my band director smile toward me, inviting me to be pinned anyway. Looking around the band room, every little detail reminds me of all the times I\\'ve felt accepted, as a part of family whose bond can never be broken, no matter what. This band room creates memories, and inspires people who pass through every year to create something larger than what lies physical. Those who have never played an instrument, or have ever been in band, tend to see our crazy noise- the music, tings of metal instruments hitting each other, and our never ending \\'band camp\\' stories- as some sort of weird chaos. But, it\\'s somewhat like Greek mythology. From chaos, came a world full of tragedy, love, happiness, and progress. From our chaotic sounds and experiences in this room, comes music that touches all, bringing smiles to children\\'s faces during parades and honoring veterans on Veteran\\'s day, spreading itself from person to person. I love the band room, not only for the way it keeps us feeling accepted and gives us the ability to spread happiness, I love it because it reminds me of where I came from, who I once was, and it shows me all the things I could be.   \"}, {\"index\": 894, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I am 6\\'5\\' with a fairly athletic build, and I have played several years of recreational tennis, so when I walked into the tryouts for my high school tennis team I was fairly confident that I would qualify. However, my high hopes plummeted when I played a poor first round and was eliminated in the early cuts. The loss was beyond imagination, but the blow to my ego was even more painful. My steps and heart heavy, I began the long walk back to the locker room, but along the way, I noticed a flyer for my school\\'s FIRST robotics team. I did not want to miss other opportunities by dwelling on my failures in tennis, so I decided to give it a chance.Opportunities don\\'t always show up in the ways you would imagine; you have to live in the present to recognize the ones knocking on your door. \"}, {\"index\": 895, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'The 50m freestyle is next. Swimmers, take your positions.\\' I stepped onto the diving platform as the announcer\\'s voice echoed through the natatorium and tightened my goggles, not too tight, but just right, like Goldilocks\\' porridge. This was my debut since my hiatus from the U10 YMCA Sharks. Standing on the diving board, I could feel the power of the room engulf my being; energy filled my body while my fingers began to tingle. \\'Chariots of Fire\\' by Vangelis began to play in my ears.Today, I would live up to my potential. The feng-shui of the surrounding environment was in spiritual harmony; the stars had aligned the night before - even the Mayan Calendar, although wrong about the date of the apocalypse, had predicted my emergence as the clear victor of this important race. My heart beat to the war drums of Alexander the Great; my blood pumped to the deafening cries of Hannibal\\'s elephants, my mind became a paradise of tranquility, liberated from anxiety.I glanced at the other swimmers, their fear evident through the tinted film of their goggles, nervousness radiating from their trembling bodies. I couldn\\'t help but silently chuckle. I was the Nelson to their Bonaparte, the Lincoln to their Davis, the Tesla to their Edison. I was Poseidon; the pool, my home.With the sound of the starting horn, I dove in with the grace of Michael Phelps and the elegance of a bottlenose dolphin. Parents and coaches gasped with incredulity, witnessing an impossible miracle. However, as my head hit the water, my goggles were torn from my face with the harnessed power of a thousand suns. The world dissolved into blackness, my eyes blinded by the relentless onslaught of infinite liquid; frantically, I tried to resurface.My goal of winning this race was dashed; my dreams chipped and cracked with every crash against the lane lines. After what seemed like an eternity, I finished a whopping minute and thirty-two second behind first. Wiping the burning pool water from my eyes, I grudgingly glanced around the natatorium, feeling the same lack of accomplishment Leonardo DiCaprio must have felt when he realized, after his fifth nomination, he still had not felt how an Oscar fits in one\\'s hands.What I saw caused a deep, painful rush of embarrassment and shame to cut through my soul. Students giggled; coaches refused to make eye contact; parents and other spectators had their faces in their hands. Climbing out of the pool, I could hear \\'Danny Boy\\' softly echoing through the building. I tried to take the stance of a defeated martyr, a man who could retain a sense of dignity and hope, but my will to continue swimming had been destroyed by the humiliating darkness of absolute failure.As I commenced the walk of shame back to my school\\'s bench, past the mocking glances of rival swimmers, a boy my age - whom I didn\\'t know - walked up to me. He stuck out his hand to shake mine and said, \\'Everyone has a bad day. You\\'ll get \\'em next time.\\'Those words, coming from someone I had never met, did more for me than any inspirational speech or pep talk could have done. That boy instilled in me a new drive that I took to every subsequent practice, improving until attaining a thirty-two second freestyle in my final race. In the rest of my swim meets, I strove to be, to other struggling swimmers, what that boy had been to me: one shimmering beacon of hope in turbulent waters.In complete defeat, when one\\'s inner spirit is crushed with despair, it\\'s not a support group or weeks of binge-watching Friends while crying into a container of Ben and Jerry\\'s ice cream that\\'s needed to cast some positive light onto the situation.

You just have to find, or be, that person. \"}, {\"index\": 896, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] With the cacophony of noise, the potential for being whacked by low-hanging branches, and the oppressive heat, I am perfectly content on my John Deere riding lawnmower. It\\'s ironic, but among these less-than-pleasant factors, I find myself completely at peace.Of course, one doesn\\'t usually associate mowing the lawn with peacefulness. Such serenity is only achieved by the innovative technology that is the noise-cancelling headphone. With a pair of these, I can shut out the endless drone of the lawnmower, as well as the rest of the world. Then, and only then, can I truly enjoy my favorite music. No, I don\\'t regularly blast out my ears with Eminem or Katy Perry or even Macklemore, as many of my peers would. Rather, I find myself perfectly content when I immerse myself in classical music.For me, classical music takes many different forms, from the blaring brass of Holst\\'s \\'Mars\\' to the subdued piano of Debussy\\'s \\'Clair de Lune\\' to the fantasy-like nature of Rimsky-Korsakov\\'s \\'Scheherazade.\\' Regardless of the style, I have always found an ability to connect with such music, a connection that transcends reality. Listening often produces a sudden burst of energy, or sometimes a period of personal introspection. This profound connection I have with such music stems from my own past musical experience.My relationship with classical music developed from an early age, when my parents, constantly irritated by my incessant whining, would play a recording of Vivaldi\\'s \\'The Four Seasons,\\' which instantly silenced and captivated me. From then, classical music and I only grew closer. I was a black-belt recorder player in fifth grade, which was more impressive then than it sounds now, and in sixth grade, I joined band as a clarinet player, largely because Squidward plays the clarinet on the TV show Spongebob Squarepants. I quickly became enamored with clarinet-playing, choosing to take private lessons and to expand my performance opportunities with competitions, recitals, honor bands, etc. Later, I even decided to teach myself how to play the piano, motivated by a simple desire to play Beethoven\\'s eerie yet peaceful \\'Moonlight Sonata,\\' which I achieved within a year. I mention all of this, not to laud my musical abilities, but to demonstrate my passion for such wonderful music.My contentedness on the lawnmower is not to say that it is the only place I have to enjoy such tunes. A quick YouTube search on the computer affords me the same opportunity while I am, say, computing complex Taylor-series polynomials. However, there\\'s a problem with this scenario, namely, the complex Taylor-series polynomial needing to be computed. Such mundane work presents a clear impediment to fully appreciating such wondrous music. At these times, I hear the music, but I cannot listen to it. Only in such environments where I am completely unengaged mentally can I truly listen. Then, every crescendo and decrescendo, every melody and counter-melody, every entrance and release, all are in perfect balance. I can hear everything, from the high-pitched expressiveness of the upper woodwinds to the striking tonality of the brass to the flowing lyricism of the strings. It is truly an incredible experience.I realize that I may be somewhat of an anomaly among my peers with my musical tastes, but that doesn\\'t really bother me. It\\'s not as if I don\\'t ever listen to and enjoy hip-hop or rap; it\\'s just that I prefer the broad array of sounds that only classical music offers. I have found, after listening to many genres of music, that \\'popular\\' music requires words to convey even a cursory meaning, while classical music requires no words to convey a profound meaning. \"}, {\"index\": 897, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 898, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Overcoming the StandardChildren raised in an unstable environment, similar to the one I was born in, are not expected to be successful. The standard is to graduate high school without getting pregnant or arrested; therefore, there is a prevalent misconception that foster children will not accomplish great feats. I am an example of the exception to that crippling stereotype. I made it my goal to prove people wrong, and accomplish more than anyone thought I could. I am a child that came from a drug-filled background, but I have overcome that obstacle, and stand as one of the most successful students at my school.  The progression of time has faded my memory of the parents that created me, but my childhood is an inescapable, permanent scar of remembrance. A spider-infested trailer, complete with a hole in the kitchen floor, is what I called home. My parents were drug addicts, and an irresponsible breed of people.  My fragmented memories contain images of the parents who were supposed to love me, leaving me alone to care for my younger brother while they injected needles into their arms. I know now what those needles contained, but my na\\\\u00efve mind could not come to that conclusion at six years old. Nighttime was dreary, and babysitters became dearer to me than my parents. My mother did her business in the nightclubs, while my father remained nearby and watched. He found himself in and out of jail quite often. There was a lack of structure, guidance, and love. Removal from their care was relieving, but a child should never have to live knowing that her parents chose to continue consuming drugs, even if it meant the loss of that child.  I resided in an abundance of foster homes for two years after I was taken away, but it felt like a lifetime before I was certain about my future. The posed dilemma was that my siblings and I wished to be adopted together, but that proved difficult as there were not many takers of three children of varying ages, especially a middle son with a history of anger issues and molestation. My sister was born straight into the foster system, and my brother ended up in a separate home. He was my best friend, the only person that had been with me through everything, and I could not see him any longer. Throughout this time, I forced myself to stay motivated in school, and learned at a young age that education was the most important goal a person could set for themselves. I reflected on the path my parents had traveled, and strove to travel the right path to be a good example for my siblings. Eventually we all three were taken into an embracing family, and received the love, guidance, and nourishment that fosters prosperous growth and development. The adoptive couple was kind-hearted, and I was ecstatic to have a family and a home where I belonged. After many years of living a happy, picturesque life, the tides turned. My father always told me that he adopted us with the intention to remove us from a life of drugs; however, that statement proved to be ironic and hypocritical. My father, Tony, became addicted to various pills, and I was subjected to the side effects. I would come home to him passed out on the kitchen floor, or he would fall asleep while driving. His quality of life was deteriorating, and it was depressing witnessing his incoherent physical actions and his mental absence. My parents separated, and I was prohibited from seeing my dad. He made empty efforts to improve his condition; nevertheless, there were many disappointments. Death came around, and claimed his life with liver failure due to his addiction. I felt betrayed and disgusted, and hated myself for not feeling grief or remorse. I would continue through life without an inspirational father figure.  The story of my life posed an enormous emotional barrier within my psyche. I endured situations that other children were never exposed to. Instead of falling victim to the risqu\\\\u00e9 activities that characterized my childhood, I rose above that obstacle and put myself on the other end of the spectrum: I oppose all drug related activities, and remain a good influence on my peers. My studies became my main focus and I sustain a highly moral character. I am among the top ten seniors in my graduating class, and in the future I aspire to obtain the highest degree in my college education and attend a prestigious university. The biggest motivational drive in overcoming these challenges has been my mom. She encourages me to shoot for the stars, and I have. Although my childhood and the lingering memories of drug addict parents letting me down remain the largest obstacles in my life, I am thankful that I had that experience: it made me the self-motivated and responsible individual that I am today.  \"}, {\"index\": 899, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Approaching the colossus with hesitant steps, I peered under its lid, suspiciously examining the bronze coils beneath as if they would detach themselves from the golden crown and lash out at me. Reassured that I could proceed in relative safety, I shuffled over the stained floorboards, evading the giant\\'s legs and seamy underbelly. Sitting down on a raised bench, my hands fell randomly over its chilled ivory teeth, the warmth of my finger tips dragged out with each passing breath. In a fit of panic, I drove my hands down, hard and fast, causing a flurry of hammers to strike those bronze coils. A discordant chord reverberated across the room. Glancing down, I thought to myself: What have I done? Then I pushed down again.Growing up, I never intended to teach myself the piano. I was always stuck in the required music classes: Understanding Music through Listening, Musical Appreciation, Why Do I Have to Sit Through This Class, etc. Something like playing an instrument, a skill requiring so much practice and human effort for an often imperfect result, never appealed to me. Forget it, I told myself. It\\'s a waste of time. To the horror of my friends, recently enamored with the Beatles, I even had the audacity to bravely denounce the efficacy of instruments; any sound they can make a computer program can produce better. I was met with gasps. Yet when I took a chance by sitting down on that piano bench, by pulling up YouTube on my iPad and slowly but surely committing Coldplay\\'s \\'Paradise\\' to memory, I acted out of, but definitely into, a new character. Abandoning the conventionality of reading sheet music, I opted to memorize or even, dare I say it, improvise new music. With my fingers dancing over the keys, what started off as a whimsical pursuit evolved into a world of new possibilities. Quasi-satiated with the piano, I tried my hand at guitar, and then the drums. Counterintuitively,  moving from 88 keys to six strings to two sticks fashioned from hickory wood was harder than one would anticipate. But the correlation among the three was clear, almost mathematical in nature. Then my curiosity escaped from a strictly musical realm. If math lay at the heart of my venture into music, why not learn the basics of CSS and HTML programming through Code Academy, another online resource? Maybe not 88 keys this time, but 26 letters nonetheless. Searching for a way to sweep French into this new wave of curiosity, I stumbled onto Duolingo, a language-learning application that greets the user with the smiling face of a green owl. After completing AP French, I was about to delete the program when the option to learn German flashed on the screen. Use Duolingo to learn some basic German? Sounds Spa\\\\u00df to me.I\\'ve always known that somewhere inside of me lay an inherently ravenous curiosity, a certain love of learning. The piano, in a way, was a catalyst for this curiosity. Yet now, I have begun to see that pushing down on that piano was more than just an attempt to fulfill that desire, that forgoing sheet music was more than just an attempt at originality. They were acts of communication. It was me, a slightly high-strung, results-driven, stay-in-the-box type freshman, recognizing that despite all the work I was putting into school, I still lacked a basic fluency in the languages of the world. It was me attempting to change that. And in this change, I wasn\\'t going to restrict myself to one way of communication, to one instrument, to one language, to one sheet of music. As my beloved French teacher  once advised me, \\'You seem like a perfectionist. Life is more fun when you\\'re not.\\' I agree. Sometimes, it\\'s better to throw out the sheet music. \"}, {\"index\": 900, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'You can\\'t have a career in science and lead a fulfilling life. Sorry, but you just can\\'t,\\' the girl sitting next to me concluded, shrugging contentedly as the bell rang. The rest of the choir members packed up their belongings, but I remained seated, trembling from both bewilderment and rage.It was the first day back from winter break, and we had spent our choir rehearsal reflecting on our holiday performances. Instead of focusing on the glamorous Winter Concert, the conversation kept returning to our mornings spent Christmas caroling in soup kitchens and homeless shelters. The conversation quickly turned sour, however, when one of my classmates asserted that only artists could truly love serving society. Wait -- what? To me, the benefit of everyone having different interests is that society needs all types of people. This diversity of interests allows humanity to grow in all directions. Nonetheless, my classmates were quick to buy into the idea that artists were the only people who enjoyed helping others.For a moment, I locked eyes with my best friend sitting all the way in the bass section, and I thought he understood my frustration. Of course I loved singing as much as anyone else in the room, but I\\'d dreamed of researching autism since I was in elementary school. While many of my classmates were preparing to audition for music conservatories, I was searching for medical and research internships. My cheeks burned as I recalled the numerous occasions on which I\\'d written in my choir journal about my experiences mentoring students with autism. My best friend knew all about my future plans, but when his turn came to speak, he jumped right on the bandwagon with the rest of the choir. If only science or art, but not both, could make the world a better place, arguing in favor of science would discredit the importance of our musical community service.My hand shot up, propelled by an outrage I\\'d never felt before. My classmates\\' unintentional assault on my aspirations made me realize how accustomed we are to holding one idea as \\'true\\' and another as \\'false\\' while in reality, neither is necessarily right or wrong simply because we prefer it. So as I impatiently awaited my turn to speak, I pondered the shackles imposed on us by dichotomous thinking. Da Vinci surely would not approve. In an age when pixels dominate photography, engineering strives for elegance, and animations help test hypotheses, art and science are inextricably woven together.I sat forward in my seat, hand still raised high, hopeful that I could break down the walls this conversation had built between my classmates and me. But my imagined monologue never came to fruition, and every time my hand was overlooked, it felt heavier and more hesitant. I schlepped out of the choir room that day, dragging behind my classmates like gum stuck to the bottom of one of their shoes, and feeling just as ignored.When I think back on that painful afternoon, I still can\\'t believe that my interest in a so-called STEM career made the people I trust and identify with most think me less of a genuine human. Even worse, I\\'m sorry to say that their ignorance made me question my own sense of direction, if only for a minute. The truth is, after a month of hard work at the Governor\\'s School, the applause my research team received following our presentation was, to me, just as energizing as the applause after a musical performance. I consider myself lucky to find fulfillment in multiple realms. I know I will deal with this inevitable dichotomy for the rest of my life, but I refuse to be defined by an either-or. No matter where I go in science or the arts, my true fulfillment will come from helping to blur the lines, no matter where they are drawn. \"}, {\"index\": 901, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 902, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  In the over-scheduled haze of adolescence, many teens long to go back to the simpler days of kindergarten, but few actually get to live out this fantasy. However, I am lucky enough that once a week I get to spend my morning in kindergarten and I even get paid to do it. To clarify, I do not just sneak into my synagogue every Sunday morning to relive my childhood; rather, I am a teacher\\'s aid. As part of my job I am given many responsibilities to help class run smoothly, ranging from supervising recess to participating in activities to set an example that even \\'big kids\\' follow Jewish rules. But none of that compares to the joy that I feel every week when I walk up those familiar stairs to find adorable faces smiling at me, eager to tell me about a movie they watched or a mitzvah they did.  Nestled up on the third floor of Temple Beth Hillel-Beth El is a cozy little classroom dedicated to teaching kindergarteners Jewish principles during the week in the preschool and on Sundays in the religious school. The bright posters on the walls and potted plants on the windowsills are welcoming enough, but what makes it even more special is that it is all ours. That classroom, and the entire third floor, became a world of learning prayers and Torah lessons with unmatched enthusiasm and openness. It is contagious to watch my nine little kindergarteners absorb the lessons and really apply them, like with their mitzvah notes. A mitzvah is defined as a good deed and it was one of the first concepts that the kids learned. Every week, the kids are encouraged to bring a note into Hebrew school with any mitzvahs they have done during the past week, from helping clean up a mess to playing with a new classmate at school. This creates a beautiful environment where each child is praised for their kindness and even gets to play a game by guessing who did which mitzvah. To show them that even a big old 17-year-old does mitzvahs, I also bring in notes sharing my own good deeds. As silly as it sounds, being able to share my own mitzvahs with the class has helped me become more cognizant of my own behavior as much as it teaches them the same lesson. My role in the classroom goes beyond fun and games with the kids. I often act as a liaison to the main office to make copies and ask for extra supplies so the teacher can keep teaching. Through this, I have become much more comfortable with not only talking to adults, but talking to authority figures with confidence. I am so glad to have gained enough trust from the teacher to have an integral role in the classroom. Throughout last year, the teacher consulted me, a mere teenager, on the best schedule for the kids like I was another adult in the classroom. When a particular child was disruptive in class, it was I who took him out in the hallway, calmly explained why the teacher was frustrated, and helped him shake out his rogue energy before bringing him back to class without causing interruptions in the lesson.Even with the lessons I learned about working with adults, being a better person, managing a classroom, and thinking on my feet, (with kindergarteners, you never know what you\\'re going to get) the most valuable thing I have gained from my job is the kids\\' trust. When a little girl slips her hand into mine as we walk down the hallway or a little boy excitedly explains the plot to the most recent Muppets movie, I know that their trust in me allows me to make a difference in their lives. Just that knowledge is enough to make the kindergarten classroom the environment where I feel the most content. \"}, {\"index\": 903, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]           PTSD, one of the most devastating acronyms  a service member and his/her family member may hear after completing their military commitment. The lasting effect of this mental disability challenges and affects the individual and those they come into contact with. PTSD is not only a disorder discussed between patient and doctor, but also a label with stigmas attached to it that further isolate and distance the sufferer from those around him; thus, making it more difficult to treat. The addition of this uncontrollable variable further complicates the entirety of the disorder, and places a greater appreciation on the effective treatments. The blare of the loud speakers are a reminder of the air raid sirens, the firework display recalls the night the base was attacked by artillery shells, and the jostling crowd conceals the enemy. These irrational thoughts of the sounds and visuals from a normal sporting event trigger a PTSD episode. Those around the victim, hearing the same sounds and seeing the same visuals, do not react as he does; they go about their environment as he once did before his deployment. Understanding the differences between the afflicted and the normal will help expedite the process to improve the quality of life of both the sufferer and those interacting with him. One perspective which will further the understanding of the disorder is to take into account the challenges that both society and the environment places on the patient. The intuitive perspective sheds new light on what has evolved from shell shock to PTSD, and has successfully improved the lives of those suffering. Majoring in Human Biology, Health, and Society, will allow me to immerse myself in this college\\'s perspective of innovative thought while continuing to pursue my life goal of becoming a surgeon. Within the program, I wish to become well versed in human physiology. Above all, it would be my priority to conduct research that may lead to performing new surgeries that equal or surpass current methods. My focus would be on providing a faster and more efficient surgery that would cut down on recovery time. If successful in my endeavor, I could employ more efficient methods to arenas like the battlefield, where cutting down on idle time and maintaining a strong able population is vital to saving lives. As a grandson of two veterans, and a patriot who greatly appreciates the sacrifice of soldiers, I wish to repay the world\\'s veterans with a service that can save their lives, or the lives of their comrades. Not entirely tethered to the military, the application of such methods could be employed even within our own borders, allowing for a quicker return to work for the sick or injured and thus, providing a more stable work force. Additionally, these new and improved methods could be instrumental in third world countries, where sterile facilities are few and far between.  The unique perspective of the college of Human Ecology, integrating normally overlooked details into research, provides the chance to contemplate the interaction between patient and environment, possibly leading to more advanced methods of treatment. Akin to the actions of my country\\'s guardians, I would be honored to be a part of a program with the virtuous goal of improving the living conditions and the quality of life of its citizens.  \"}, {\"index\": 904, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] When I was offered the ASEAN scholarship to study overseas at twelve,  I was elated at my personal and financial independence. As long as I produced good results, I was free to do anything. I filled my afternoons with plays, music performances and poetry slams, learning more about the local arts scene I never got to explore back in Malaysia, and meeting people from different backgrounds. Every conversation with strangers made made me realize how sheltered I was, living in the bubble of middle-class comfort. I then decided to take upon volunteering in hopes of bursting that bubble.One fund-raising project I embarked on to help the physically disabled made me acutely aware of my privilege as an able-bodied person. The structural reinforcements of these privileges that may not be immediately explicit to those who benefit, but immensely palpable to these disenfranchised. Slowly, I became aware of the rules and laws that govern our actions, and the structures we operate within.Back in Malaysia, I lived in the Chinese-populated Penang. As a Malaysian Chinese, I was initially unaware of my second-class citizenship until I overheard my father\\'s exasperations over his failed biddings on construction projects, solely because he was not Malay. I felt indignant. Was I not Malaysian enough just because I was not Malay? How could then I call Malaysia home, when I was not treated as part of the family?Then again, our nuclear family was no better. I grew up with a father who was frequently absent from home. The nights he came to visit, my parents would end up fighting.  Disenchanted at the age of seven, I remembered questioning the basis of what formed a family, and whether our fragmented one could still qualify. Perhaps due to the stress of work, my father used to hit my mom a lot. For a while, I blindly bought into the idea that \\'every family is dysfunctional in its own ways\\' and regarded it as normal.Gradually, I no longer wanted to be the girl hiding behind the stairways helplessly when they fought, so I took up judo in Singapore, driven by the naive hope that thirteen-year-old me could avert any future familial conflict.After six years, I picked up so much more than physical skills - I found a new family in my teammates, forged in arenas of violence and camaraderie. My adopted judo family has a hierarchical structure that breeds fear and reverence, similar to my biological one where my father wields absolute authority. But I accepted both, one for the blood, sweat and tears we spilled together over the course of six years, and the other for the blood, sweat and tears shared over my entire lifetime.In the past, I never knew I had a choice, of whom to call my family; now, I realize that the notion of family was never really set in stone. Likewise, so is my future. Even though there are some aspects in my life that I cannot control, I can determine how I choose to look at them and where I choose to go from there.  In many ways, family is a microcosm of society: how money, gender and power relations play out. My relationship with my family has fueled an earnest desire to grasp the unspoken: rules, hierarchies and boundaries, of society. I believe that by understanding how society functions, I am understand the social and human conditions that shaped my family, and come to terms with our flaws. \"}, {\"index\": 905, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] At the age of ten I had the jarring realization that parents are not perfect when I discovered that my dad was a gambler. He left in the middle of the night, pawned my Wii, and played poker until I called him to scream for what felt like an hour. I have never understood his reasoning for gambling, insisting that it was to \\'help out with money.\\' Sure he was thinking about our family and hoping that one day he would meet Lady Luck, but a greater part of him was selfish. This addiction consumed him, and it overwhelmed the entire family to know that he fell in love with the game that tore our family apart. To drown out my parents\\' arguments about how my dad should try his luck at the unemployment counter instead of the blackjack table, I was concentrating on my education. The disagreements worsened in 2009 as my dad had an attack of gout preventing him from working as a taxi driver. But this did not stop him from stealing my mom\\'s money to take a taxi to the casino. Those days were filled with anger toward my dad. I was unable to spend time at the library with friends, but he was able to pawn my guitar and cash-in my birthday checks. After the gout worsened my dad became bedridden, and I could see the fragmented expressions of pain the whole family had suffered through. Then one day he broke down. He spent an entire afternoon apologizing to my family for his failures as a father. As the raw sentiments fell down his cheek, I began to feel humbled. Even though I was constantly angry with him, he allowed me the chance to restart our relationship. For this I am eternally grateful as we are on better terms now.However, to make up for the lack of funds, my family went to food banks every Sunday morning. I loved the notion of charity until I was the one receiving it. It was a cynical and ungrateful perspective, but eventually these trips became highlights of my week because I witnessed compassion in each person that I met. While my friends were at the mall, I was at Sunday mass for guidance on turning my perceived tragedies into triumphs.  In retrospect, I have never been more thankful for a period of my life than when my family was literally struggling through each day. These experiences have shaped my philosophies, established my priorities, and motivated my passions. Growing up in a financially unstable environment revealed to me the importance of a significant support system. Without those struggles, I do not think I would have been as interested in pursuing my education. I like to think that my motivation to excel is a combination of my innate sense of curiosity and my need to survive. Rather than letting my financial and family background dictate my life, I choose to focus my energy into school. I am a learner. My eighth grade science teacher introduced me to TED Talks, and there were several speakers from impoverished backgrounds. These eighteen minute speeches ended my notion that I was not allowed to have aspirations because my family is poor. However, this idea was not an epiphany. It was a gradual realization that if I study diligently, engage actively in discussion, and take advantage of every opportunity afforded to me, then I can achieve my goals as a student. I am grateful that I was raised on the principle that happiness comes through hard work, and strength of my family, because without it I would not have taken the initiative to apply for the math and science magnet program at Ed W. Clark High School or joining Speech and Debate. I became devoted to answering every question even if I was wrong and joining the most challenging clubs on campus because if there is anything that my parents instilled in me, it is that I should not let life pass me by. Our life is a struggle, but without these crusades for improvement, I would not have my sense of passion. My family may be full of individuals who have let their struggles and addictions define them, but I have learned to acknowledge mine and control their effect on my life with a sense of conviction. \"}, {\"index\": 906, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Running to Medicine Running is something I love to do. As my feet hit the pavement, I spend my time thinking of ways that I can increase my speed and distance with every step. To me, becoming a physician is much like my outlook on running. From my experience shadowing surgeons, neonatologists, radiologists, and internal medicine specialists, and my experience volunteering in the emergency room, I know a career in medicine is challenging, but more than anything, my experiences have shown me how much I love medicine for three reasons. The first reason I am attracted to medicine is it is a profession of service. Physicians go to work with the challenges of the day unbeknownst to them, yet they always know they will be serving patients. One of my most satisfying activities in high school has been volunteering with young adults with autism and Down\\'s syndrome. I love spending time with these inspiring young adults, but the fact that someday I will be able to use my gifts to help others on a greater scale as a physician excites me.The second reason I love medicine is it allows me to unite all of passions into one profession of helping others. I love learning about other cultures, traveling internationally, and speaking Spanish. Becoming a bilingual physician will open many doors for me to travel and serve a wider variety of people, helping me to make an impact and improve care for those who are often overlooked. The last reason I am attracted to becoming a physician is the constant evolution of medical technology and procedures. Physicians are always taking advantage of new equipment and knowledge to benefit their patients, a direct reflection of becoming better, doing more, and making a global impact. Recently I observed a live robotic surgery, and I was intrigued at the improvements made in medicine to ease the patient\\'s journey through surgery. I question the world around me, and medicine will allow me to continue to put my questions in action to find answers. In high school I have conducted research on water quality, and I desire to research at the undergraduate level and beyond to continue to improve medical knowledge for the benefit of all.Running is challenging, but I have a focused and determined personality that allows me to push myself forward each day, and I know I will apply these same principles in my career as a physician.  \"}, {\"index\": 907, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Through the Looking GlassFrom the passenger\\'s seat, I became accustomed to the cruise down Hunters Crossing. The homes welcomed my stare, and, into their fenestra I attempted to see who had the nicest kitchen. When I began driving, I trained my eyes to ignore the familiar call of the glowing houses, and to focus instead on the road. The passenger\\'s side window and glass panes of the houses became the front windshield of my mother\\'s car and a pair of eyeglasses on my face. Stainless steel appliances and oak cabinets were replaced by the merciless reality of responsibility, and some oncoming traffic.  After the events of June first, I can confirm, eyes are hard to train, and spectacles don\\'t offer much assistance when a vehicle is rapidly approaching. There I was, in my mother\\'s big black Honda, advancing towards the end of Hunters Crossing where it intersects Route 116, ready to make the crossover from familiarity onto the faster-paced freeway leading to my destination. With my gaze set staunchly through the frames of my glasses, and the glass of the windshield, I began to inch my car away from the stop sign. A navy blue SUV came into the picture, prompting me to slam on my brakes. Unfortunately, my brakes didn\\'t stop the other vehicle. A cacophonous sound and monstrous jolt confirmed a collision.  I shuddered at the thought of getting back behind the wheel after the accident. At sixteen years old, I found myself back on the bench seats, again peering through the side windows to avoid the reality of the road ahead. The thought of seeing the navy blue car advancing towards me was petrifying. My pride was as marred as the car, but after encouragement from my mother and my own persistence, I realized one miniscule accident could not hold me back from obtaining the independence of driving I once yearned for. Everyone gets in accidents sometimes; my sometime just happened to be on June 1, 2015. A popular Japanese proverb says you fall down seven times, stand up eight. Although I don\\'t plan on crashing my mom\\'s car six more times, I did \\'stand up\\' when I fell down. Within about three weeks of the accident, I shuffled into my dad\\'s old white Hyundai. With knuckles as white as the sedan and anxious tension, I began my drive down Hunters Crossing and onto 116 with success. I eventually took my road test in the old white Hyundai, and passed! Almost daily, I make the turn onto 116 in that same car. For years, I have been traveling down the same path and going by the same landmarks. When the road ends and I have to pull into traffic, what will I do? Perhaps, I will do what I should have done on June first; come to a complete stop, decide what to do, and proceed when safe. I have learned that when life reaches a cross-roads, I need to readjust the lenses through which I view the situation. Sometimes, I need to expand the frame to include unexpected blue SUVs hurdling toward me. Other times, I need to narrow my view to limit distractions of glowing houses.When the path clears, I can drive into the future without incident. Even if I make the wrong decision, the most important admonition I took away from my car accident experience reminds me that I cannot be afraid to get right back in the driver\\'s seat and keep going. Failure, and apparently car accidents, are inevitable, but I can overcome the fear of failure and take control of my own success.  \"}, {\"index\": 908, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'Eww!\\' exclaimed several of my classmates during a lecture on Chinese history. Their faces contorted into grimaces of disgust as the teacher showed us a grotesque photo of the Chinese cultural practice of foot binding: a pair of feet twisted at an impossible angle. A boy turned in his seat and, chomping obnoxiously on his minty gum, sneered, \\'How\\'re your feet, Alice?\\' The collective gaze of the class seemed to beat down on me. I squirmed in my seat, my face reddened by embarrassment and fury.When I came to the United States eight years ago, enrolling in public school was like being thrown head first into a melting pot among a stir fry of races. I was immersed in diverse cultures and values, truly believing in the tolerance and acceptance America has promised. However, after noticing the seemingly careless jeers and laughs of my peers, the hidden deceit in all stereotypes overwhelmed me.Could those few pages of Chinese history textbook pages dominated by words such as \\'Communism\\' and \\'Tiananmen Square Massacre\\' truly represent the country China is? Self-doubts seemed to boil over inside me as I questioned the country in which I\\'ve grown up and with which I\\'ve identified myself. Was I really just another \\'Communist Chinese\\'? A brainwashed zombie? Was that really all that my mother country had given me?No, that couldn\\'t be true. My peers could not possibly truly understand the rich, golden Chinese culture and history hidden behind the musty, dark mask of political labels without living them the way I have: rolling a fat brush in ink carefully grinded for smooth formation of kaishu calligraphy; lighting the round, red lanterns for the promise of happiness in a new year; tapping my Chinese paintbrush on paper, giving life to the flight of a dragonfly; tipping my toes while swirling my arms to the folksongs from XinJiang. They couldn\\'t possibly know the warmth of a Chinese New Year night as the entire family huddles on the sofa in front of the TV, enjoying the eloquence of xiqu, an ancient Chinese opera passed down from the Han Dynasty, and laughing at the puns of a well-thought-out xiangsheng, the Chinese traditional crosstalk. If I have to be honest, however, I made the same exact mistake about the States.In my nine-year-old mind, I innocently believed that life in the magical \\'land of freedom\\' consisted of blissfully eating McDonald\\'s everyday while playing at school, free of any homework, stress, or troubles. Without question, my understanding of my new environment has changed drastically in my past eight years in the United States. By moving from classrooms full of peers of the same ancestors and culture to classrooms full of people of all religious beliefs, races, and backgrounds, I have gained a valuable, new perspective. As I sit, huddling on the sofa re-watching classics with my friends - a Creole Catholic, a Malaysian Muslim, a Mexican atheist, a Caucasian Mormon - as another New Year rolls by, it suddenly dawned on me: though the world is filled with people of diverse interests and heritages, we are the same sentient beings.Each nation has a face both beautiful and flawed. I am deeply grateful to have had the opportunity to live in both China and the United States, giving me the worldly outlook I now have. Although I would rather eat a hamburger every day for the rest of my life than ever experience foot-binding, and although I am proud to take part in a system of government that values the voice of its people, I am equally proud of the complex and magical history of my ancestors. The combination of these interwoven fabrics, the ability to be many things at once and not have to apologize, these are the true boons of having grown up in a multifaceted globe. No stereotype can defile that. \"}, {\"index\": 909, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Just as the different parts of the community contribute to the Duke campus, the different male role models in my life have prepared me for the future and have shaped me into the man I am today. First, my father, Ralph Brown Jr., was a unique man made of integrity, perseverance, and genuine love. Over the years, he taught me the basics - how to play baseball, tie my shoes, and ride a bike. However, the most important thing he taught me was respect. In watching him, I noticed how he treated everyone he met with such civility, even the people who did not treat him with any. He also addressed every man with the \\'Mister\\' suffix, even when he was addressing a child. In fact, he usually called me \\'Mr. Brown.\\' Unfortunately, he passed away when I was only eleven years old. While he won\\'t be here to see me attend his alma mater, he\\'ll be with me every time I treat my professors, classmates, campus workers, and others with respect.My grandfather, William Hall, has always been amicable, popular, and articulate. Having been in elected positions for many years, my grandfather has strived to make our community a better place. Through watching his interactions with other people, I learned how to be sociable and outgoing. Most of all, I learned that, as he often says, \\'you\\'re either part of the solution or part of the problem.\\' As such, I will use his example to contribute to Duke\\'s overall success.My older brother, William Brown, has played a major role in the shaping of my personality despite being only two years older than me. He has taught me the importance of not just intelligence, but also dedication. Whenever we talk about college, he tells me about staying organized, developing great study skills, surrounding myself with focused people, and reaching out to get help. He always says that the first step to success is applying myself, whether I\\'m applying myself to education, work, or personal relationships. While he was an average student throughout high school, William has made the Dean\\'s list at his university due to his rigorous work ethic. I plan to take his advice so that I too will excel in college.Finally, one of my greatest life lessons came from my little brother. In 2005, when my brother Isaiah had passed away at the tender age of five months, I truly learned how precious life is. I know that everyone\\'s favorite clich\\\\u00e9 is that \\'life is short,\\' but Isaiah\\'s passing taught me that you never know when your time will come. That is why you should cherish each moment, appreciate the people in your life, and make the most out of every situation. With that, Isaiah\\'s death gave me a more mature outlook on life. I hope to use that perspective to be successful in college and to be a role model for others. \"}, {\"index\": 910, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] For as long as I can remember, my mother has told me that my life would be very hard.  \\'You\\'re Mexican,\\' she said.  \\'I came here when I was twenty and my life was hard and I\\'m straight!\\'  My mother left Mexico for the United States on the eve of her twentieth birthday in hopes finding a better life.  Four difficult years later, she met my father, married, and later had me.  \\'I knew from the moment you were born that you were smart.  And from the moment you could talk that you were gay,\\' she jokes now.  It was not until I turned thirteen that I even knew what the word \\'gay\\' meant.  Until then, \\'gay\\' to me was a nothing more than a word, a three letter word that meant nothing.  However, I have learned since then that this tiny, monosyllabic word would define how I lived the rest of my life.  My father, an amicable, insightful man, took a less humorous approach in dealing with the manifestation of my sexuality.   \\'It\\'s a phase,\\' he once said.  Of course, my desire to seek companionship with the male sex was not merely \\'a phase\\' but a result of a deep, primal yearning to love another human being: I just happened to like men.  These were the reoccurring themes that ruled my young life: my homosexuality and my ethnicity.  While I played with Pokemon cards in the backseat of our beat-up Jetta, my parents lectured me of the ills that were to come of life.  When my brother was born, we moved to Discovery Bay, a predominantly white neighborhood.  All of the boys who lived nearby me came from middle class families, but feigned affluence and valued wealth more than intelligence.  As I matured and developed my love for learning, I felt increasingly detached from the world right outside my front door.  This feeling of detachment followed me all throughout my middle school experience.  My teachers all knew that I was a bright young student, but they expressed concerns that certain limitations would preclude me from ever being successful in life.  \\'He\\'s smart, but he doesn\\'t listen to me and he has a hard time working with others.  That will be a problem,\\' they would all say.  My mother had a difficult time coping with the constant criticism I received from others, as she felt it was indirectly aimed at her.  \\'Why can\\'t you be a better son?\\' she would ask.  I didn\\'t and I still don\\'t know how to answer that question.   I floated apathetically through the first half of my sophomore year, bored by its unchallenging nature.  It was not until the end of that year that I met a group of friends who made me feel special and accepted for the very first time.  Unlike me, many of them did not aspire to attend a university and were content with seeking a higher education at a state-level institution. Although all of them were intelligent, engaging young women who could attend a UC if they wanted to, it was interesting to get to know people who did not share the same dreams as I did.  Connecting with these friends helped me remain grounded and taught me to value a person not by her grades, but by her brains.  My junior year, I set myself on a course to self-enlightenment.  It was a selfish, empirical journey of who I am.  I took difficult classes, I read more books, I spent less time on my phone, I met wonderful people, and I really tried to become a more fundamentally decent person.  And, for the most part, I have succeeded.                 \"}, {\"index\": 911, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Balanced atop a sand dune gazing at the electric blue Aegean Sea pounding against Santorini\\'s shores was an American family\\'s rented hatchback. Mesmerized by the astounding view, the family was exceedingly eager to pile out of the Peugeot and furiously snap their final photographs before boarding the cruise ship scheduled to depart within the hour. However, the oscillating automobile perplexed the family as they stared at the teetering car. The Peugeot straddled a 5-foot sand dune, preventing the rear tires from touching the ground.Exactly 7,042 miles from home. A 15-mile radius devoid of any civilization. Zero bars of cell service. The family began to panic. The mother requested the youngest son to ask motorists to stop for assistance. With a barrier in language, nationality, and culture, he was doubtful that a 15 year old flailing his hands in the air could result in 29 strangers lifting the 2,000-pound hatchback over the sand dune and onto the ground. He was wrong.A young couple driving a motorcycle, a second couple driving a sedan, and a bus full of Greeks decided to discover the reason behind his ungraceful gestures. After five minutes of excessive pointing and explaining the situation in raised voices hoping the volume would allow them to understand English, the magnanimous foreigners gathered around the vehicle and my perspective on life immediately changed.Every day, I wake up to a spoonful of sorrow served by various news stations. It is nearly impossible to swallow an interminable number of thefts, manslaughters, and terrorist attacks on a daily basis and still conclude that humans are truly virtuous. Thus, it\\'s no surprise that I was pessimistic regarding the benevolence of humanity. Even as a sophomore, I assumed that not all of society was as friendly as the people I ate with or played a pick-up game of soccer with during lunchtime. So when I waved my hands on the side of the highway, I was anticipating nothing more than a sore arm; the assistance the Greeks offered demolished my preconceived notion that no one would help.As a sociable and affable individual, I have always been intrigued by the psychology behind human interaction. Why do I feel the need to help a friend with calculus homework if I am solicited for assistance? Why do I attend 12 hours of marching band practice every week just to remember, in the long run, the laughs I shared with the other trumpet players rather than the music or drill learned? The answers are simple. I value human relationships and cohesion among people. At school, I have created many friendships - ones that will hopefully last a lifetime. Until this remarkable experience in Santorini, however, I had believed that outside my sphere of companions, people were not instinctively charitable.In 2013, I attended the National Student Leadership Conference at Northwestern University where I met over 100 aspiring future business leaders; many were just as welcoming as my friends from back home. I especially recall the night Marcus, the Vietnamese student, came into my dorm and bravely introduced himself. His selfless gesture amazed me, and we instantly became friends. The next morning we ate breakfast together, shared life stories, and a year later we still update each other about our lives. The summer of 2014 reinforced the idea that people are instinctively good-natured as I became friends with the drum major of a nearby high school and even learned life morals from a suicide survivor during the Ronald Reagan Student Leadership Program. I now acknowledge that people are inherently generous and gregarious, excited to fortify relationships with others, especially in times of need.Some individuals are fearful of stepping forward, lacking the courage to assist strangers. But at the core of humanity, it\\'s possible for us to lift our fears, push them aside, and use our altruism to drive our society forward. \"}, {\"index\": 912, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Miasmal Maverick\\'Pride\\'s a little fire. Extinguish it and you shiver unbelieving, ignite it and you shout unthinking. But light a candle with it and you shine understanding.\\'After writing that line of dialogue, I felt a sobriety that lingered through the rest of the chapter. All at once I realized how familiar it was\\\\u2014from stuttering unconfidently during my first debate competitions, from eating my words after poor performance on a linear algebra test I\\'d boasted about, and from resolving a grudge against an old academic rival and knowing that even in my fiercest competitors I could find opportunities for collaboration. It was one of many such personal epiphanies, fueled by one of many instant coffees that tasted more of caffeine than water. But this night was different. An hour later, several pages more, and on my literary arch I finally dropped the keystone of the epilogue. Finally, my novel Miasmick was complete. Three years I spent writing this story, detailing a teenager\\'s journey through a landscape Balkanized into city-states by a nuclear exchange. The title is a portmanteau of Miasmal, revealing the unrelenting hell of post-apocalyptic murder and pettiness that the bookworm protagonist Zhenya Zhou traverses; and Maverick, reflecting the unexpected occupations of supply trader and freelance mercenary that Zhenya adopts. Inspired by works such as Cormac McCarthy\\'s The Road, I wanted to explore the extremes that lawlessness brought about: the brutality of sociopaths raiding a shelter for human chattel and the benevolence of survivors offering a family spare rations. In the safe, even insular realm of middle class San Diego, it was jarring to sit down and write about an execution by Molotov cocktails that was probably happening somewhere in the Third World at that very moment.  Moreover, I integrated substantial research and experience alike into the writing. My lifelong enthusiasm for firearms history and engineering supplied the juxtaposition between Zhenya\\'s hardscrabble toughness in his dilapidated Chinese Contract Inglis Mk. I handgun and his adversary\\'s highborn pedigree, an engraved FN Renaissance Browning Hi-Power pistol. Three years in NJROTC Marksmanship provided the mechanics for a heart-racing, lead-flinging firefight. Conversation with a Francophile friend and studying the L\\\\u00e9gion \\\\u00e9trang\\\\u00e8re created a foul-mouthed, wisecracking Legionnaire with a penchant for haggling. The breadth of history and depth of logic I respectively gained from Academic League and Cybersecurity saved me from countless inconsistencies such as a Dutch-themed Verviers in developing cities inspired by the Hanseatic League.  And through developing the struggle of my characters, I strengthened how I dealt with my own. From the birds\\' eye view of an arbiter author and from giving Cogs the gearhead anorak a socially awkward streak and infusing Seren the politicking Courtesan with an ultimately philanthropic bent, I found myself talking\\\\u2014without a hint of a stutter\\\\u2014to the choir singer or football player next to me in class. If character-building has taught me anything, it\\'s that everyone has a story to tell\\\\u2014and responding to it with disinterest is the worst disservice. In short, Miasmick was the brainchild of the marriage between years of high school experience and a lifetime of personal interests. I hope that my readers will enjoy reading about Zhenya as much as I bettered myself creating him\\\\u2014for his story, sculpted from the clay of my own, is one of my life\\'s most shining and sobering chapters.  \"}, {\"index\": 913, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] At age five I fell on a rose bush at my aunt\\'s wedding, resulting in an oval-shaped wound on my left knee. Though my father tended to the bruise, my first scar upset me: I viewed it as a burden that would forever plague my leg. Today, however, I embrace each unique scar, for in attaining each one, I grew wiser. Each one has a story that is a part of who I am.I have accumulated numerous scars, chiefly on my elbows and knees, throughout my life. Most resulted from rambunctious play or failed attempts. In chasing a ball headed into the woods during a soccer game, I received an upside down Nike symbol scratch, courtesy of a tree branch, on my forehead. A burn on my right forearm reflects an effort to remove chicken nuggets from the oven; a near identical burn on my left forearm, attained a few months later, resulted from retrieving apple chips from the same source (some lessons take longer to learn).While vacationing in the Pocono Mountains for the first time in sixth grade, I earned a notable battle scar. The vast landscape surrounding my friend\\'s cabin house perfectly suited ATV riding. Having never ridden such a vehicle, I eagerly strapped on a helmet and drove through the mountainside, exhilarated by the sight of gargantuan trees and the breeze flowing through my t-shirt. As my joy ride ended, I turned a corner too rapidly and struck a pipe, launching me into the air while the ATV soared towards the house\\'s front porch. After landing on my hands and knees, I popped back up, ready for redemption: round two with the ATV. My friend\\'s mother\\'s maternal instincts took precedence over my drive to apply the lesson learned from my first trial to a second attempt: I was forbidden from riding the ATV again. I emerged from the crash with bruised knees, the nickname \\'Air Bud,\\' and the still existing desire to improve upon my first experience riding a four-wheeler.I also bear emotional wounds, which parallel my physical scars. Those who know me are unaware of their existence until I point them out. Some of such scars are deeper than others, take longer to fade, or never completely disappear. Although they hurt at the moment of acquisition, I grow stronger because of them. My mother\\'s abandonment of my siblings and me in kindergarten left a severe emotional wound with various repercussions. From then on, I lived in separate quarters from my siblings, grew up with a single father, and learned to mother myself. Without a mother, I likely nicked my legs while shaving and burned my ears while using a flat iron on my hair more often than the average person does so. Yet attaining these emotional and physical scars taught me to soothe them on my own.In the past I tried to conceal my scars: those physical with makeup and those emotional by not discussing them. Today, instead, I bear pride in what my scars represent: strength, overcoming adversity, and perseverance. My scars are part of me - and merely that. Experiencing pain has not destroyed my spirit or eagerness to experience new things. In embracing my scars, I discovered my life mantra: Every opportunity in life is a learning opportunity. Unlike my five year old self, I anticipate a future full of growth and discovery, ready for whatever comes my way with my mantra, band-aids, and Neosporin. \"}, {\"index\": 914, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Feelings of shock, sadness, and anger still echo deep inside me as I think back to the day that my life had suddenly changed forever. Shortly after, I decided that I wasn\\'t going to let some disease hold me back from doing anything in my life even if it seemed impossible.Over the years, I have developed the unrelenting need to seek out challenging and positive opportunities. When I was selected by World Savvy through the U.S. Department of State, to travel to Peru for a month, it came as no surprise that my mother would have her qualms. Understandably, she was nervous about the idea of me traveling abroad as this would be my first time in another country without her, and as a type-1 diabetic. Ever since my diagnosis, my mother\\'s responsibilities, struggles, and worries as a single parent have increased significantly. And, as a nurse, she is fully aware of all the devastating complications that go hand-and-hand with diabetes. However, my mother simply could not let me pass up this opportunity of a lifetime. She saw this as my chance to embrace the language of my Latin roots and with all financial responsibility lifted, recognized that this was a gift, and the time to appreciate life beyond my borders while temporarily immersing myself in a culture very different from my own.The program\\'s central focus was to assess the issues of food nutrition both at home and abroad. The topic of nutrition is so central to my own identity, because I know firsthand as a diabetic, the importance of maintaining a nutritious diet and lifestyle. Additionally, I could not wait to be part of a team that would work together to create possible solutions to these problems within the Peruvian society.In Peru, exploring this relevant subject of food, its security, and its nutritional values was absolutely intriguing. Of all my amazing experiences, the most memorable for me was my two-day visit to the indigenous village of Union Chauay. Initially, I felt uncomfortable upon my arrival in the village due to its primitive environment, which took me time to adjust to. It was quite different from the two-week homestay I visited near the Amazon a few days prior and even more so from my home back in New York. Regardless of how I felt physically and emotionally, I remained curious and energetic as I could be about discovering how their food is gained, prepared and even distributed. While there, I was able to observe firsthand how an international organization was able to help transform an undernourished community into becoming a powerhouse of sustainably organic agriculture. After speaking to Francisco, a community leader, it was remarkable to hear how families who once solely relied on potatoes were now cultivating a wider selection of organic crops than many supermarkets supply here in the U.S. Coincidentally, my life appears to parallel the lives of the Peruvians. As I had to adjust to the challenges of my new lifestyle as a diabetic, the Peruvians too, had to change their own lifestyle to eradicate their problems of malnutrition.Returning home, I have realized my incredible journey to Peru has forever changed me as it has not only allowed me to appreciate Peru\\'s deeply revered culture but has also heightened my already positive outlook on life. My goal for this trip began with the thought of bringing to Peru my own experiences, which on some level I did accomplish. In a pleasant turn of events, however, it was I who was able to glean so much more than I could ever give. Through the people I met in Peru and fellow travelers with whom I had the privilege to join, I have confirmed that change is not bad after all and that the impossible CAN BE possible through mutual understanding and an unwavering desire to listen and learn from the lives of others. \"}, {\"index\": 915, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I was at home with Mom, Dad, Big Sister, and Little Brother - except none of them were actually related to me. They didn\\'t look like me, they didn\\'t talk like me, and they didn\\'t think like me - but, for one whole week, they were the only family I had.Two years ago, when my Japanese teacher announced a two week-long cultural exchange opportunity in Japan, I was the first to register. Six months later, I jetted off to Tokyo and marveled at the world-famous shopping hubs, Harajuku and Shibuya, immersed myself in anime culture at the famed Ghibli Museum, and took in a sweeping view of the city lights from atop the famous ferris wheel in Odaiba. And, in bona fide tourist form, I even managed to get lost at the train station.A week into my trip, I traveled to the tiny village of Numazu to stay with a host family for the second half of my trip. Stepping in through the doors of the house I was to call \\'home\\' for the next week, I bowed to the strangers with a simple, \\'Hajimemashite\\' - hello. My host family was sweet and accommodating, and, despite our distinct language barrier, I felt right at home. But, deep down, though I tried not to show it, I was filled with anxiety because of what was to come the next morning.  Innately shy, it took superhuman effort to will away my fear and walk into Numazu Chuo High School with Big Sister Rino. For the next week, the thirty girls in the room would be my classmates, and I eyed them nervously. Would they like me? Would we be friends? I didn\\'t have much time to ponder these questions, as I was immediately thrown into a whirlwind of activity. I presented about American culture in my stilted Japanese, took classes like history, physical education, fashion design, and cooking, and even helped the language teachers by having English dialogues with their students. No matter how mentally prepared I\\'d been for this trip, the truth is that the language barrier still made me feel lonely, the mixups and slipups still made me feel clumsy and awkward, and the cultural norms and unfamiliar traditions still made me feel confused and unintentionally rude. But during that week, I forced myself to focus on the positives, on what I could do instead of what I could not. I couldn\\'t will myself to become fluent at the snap of a finger, but I nonetheless applied every morsel of my Japanese language training to communicate with my classmates and host family. My sentences were awkward and full of mistakes, my accent too thick and sometimes incomprehensible. But I kept at it, and before I knew it, I felt completely at ease.I\\'m still not sure what motivated me - possibly one of the shiest people in the world - to embark on such a trek. But I\\'m so glad that I did. Traveling to and studying in Japan without the safety and comfort of my family and friends was nerve-wracking at first, but by welcoming me into their country and sharing their lives with me, my Japanese family and friends taught me to not fear but instead appreciate and celebrate what makes us all so unique. To this day, the friends I made in the Land of the Rising Sun are some of my closest. We keep in touch through every means possible, including video chats and phones calls. Those are my favorites because, on the rare occasion that I use the wrong word or make a basic grammar error, we cannot help but laugh as we remember how awkward I had been the day we first met. I am no longer that shy, timid girl afraid to make mistakes. In her place stands an individual unafraid, confident, and dare I say, enthusiastic about taking risks and seeking new and exciting adventures. \"}, {\"index\": 916, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I should not be alive right now. I should not be writing this essay. I should not be graduating from high school. And I definitely should not be applying to colleges. I am an African-American female. I can look outside my window and see at least five girls that I grew up with pushing strollers, simply leaving behind all of their childhood dreams because they now have to raise their own children. Every time I look out of my window, I wonder, what makes me so different from the people that I see outside? What have I done to earn the life that I am currently living?I remember being seven and wondering the same thing. Why? Why me? What did I do to deserve this? But at that time it was for a completely different reason. July 19, 2004. For most people it was a normal day. But for 7 year-old me, it was the beginning of the worst day of my life. It began with someone knocking on the door. I got sent into my parents room. My cousin sat in the living room speaking to my mom. All of a sudden I heard the door slam shut. I, having no idea what was going on, continued to watch over my younger sister. Eventually, I went into the living room to see who had left and realized that it had been my mother. My cousin told me, \\'She just went to check on your uncle. He got hurt, but he\\'ll be okay.\\' I just assumed that it was my mom\\'s oldest brother. He was always breaking a bone, so I thought nothing of it.The truth was revealed the next morning. My mom came into her room teary-eyed.\\'Your uncle was hurt last night.\\'\\'Okay...\\'\\'They had to take him to the hospital\\'\\'I know, but he\\'ll be okay.\\'\\'Your Uncle Michael was shot last night.\\'\\'I know, but he\\'s okay RIGHT? Please, please just tell me that he is okay!\\'\\'He didn\\'t make it.\\' Silence. My Uncle Michael, only 17 years old. The older brother I never had. My best friend. In that moment I didn\\'t know what to do or say. In that moment time stopped. At seven, I didn\\'t know what death meant. I definitely didn\\'t think that it meant that I would never see my uncle again. At that moment I had to do a lot more growing up than any seven year old should have to do. I had to be strong for my family. For my mom. For myself. That day, ten years ago, helped shape me into the person that I am today.Why am I different? I\\'m different because I now know how precious life is. I\\'m different because I care. I\\'m different because I know that life is short and that you have to take every opportunity that you are given and run with it. I\\'m different because I know how important it is to live a meaningful life because you\\'ll never know when it will be taken away from you. I\\'m different because I\\'m fighting for my right to live a successful and meaningful life. I\\'m different because I won\\'t ever stop. I\\'m different because I am me. I am different and I am still alive. \"}, {\"index\": 917, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I waited anxiously outside the gym, sweat dripping down my face, my heart racing. The coach impassively posted the list on the door before quickly escaping the barrage of impatient students.  I immediately scanned the list, beginning at the bottom, as I had grown accustomed to my place in alphabetized lists. Williams was the final name on the list. My heart sank. It was November 3rd, 2010, my fourteenth birthday. This marked the third consecutive year I had been cut from the middle school basketball team. I was devastated, but with unwavering determination I resolved to be a part of the high school team the following year. Upon speaking with the middle school coach, I learned that while my skills were impressive, my height was not. I focused on preparing for the following season, undisturbed by his disheartening comments. An hour later, I received an unexpected call from my middle school band director. \\'I\\'m happy to inform that you have been selected as one of ten percussionists for the Florida All-State Band.\\'  Percussion was an enjoyable hobby throughout middle school, but I had previously planned on only pursuing basketball in high school. However, after my experience at All-State, I realized my love for both activities and decided to continue both in high school.\\'You are a great point guard, but it would be difficult for you to compete with your size and stature.\\' The words from the freshman coach came as a d\\\\u00e9j\\\\u00e0 vu. I was pushing 5\\'2\\' and still under 100 pounds. It was the fourth straight year I had been cut from the school basketball team. I continued my exhausting workouts and practices, and played on AAU teams to hone my skills. Meanwhile, I was the top underclassmen percussionist and had become thoroughly committed to the band. I was first chair in the honor band, and received superior ratings on four events at the district Solo and Ensemble competition.A year later, I was 5\\'10\\', and with steadfast effort my skills had improved exponentially. I was poised to make and possibly even start on the team. But I had to make a choice. As the band was preparing for one of the largest marching band festivals in the state, the basketball hopefuls were conditioning daily and attending several tryouts. Failing to attend some of the most important rehearsals of the season would diminish my leadership role on the drumline; on the other hand, missing conditioning and tryouts would put me at a disadvantage athletically and convey a poor sense of commitment in the eyes of the coaches.I chose band. While I was reluctant to give up basketball, I had reached my goal. I proved to myself that I could make the team. I did not quit because I failed; I quit once I succeeded. Music quickly became a huge part of my life, as I now had more time to fully appreciate it. I found myself spending time listening to literature by Gillingham and Tchaikovsky rather than Lady Gaga and T-Pain. I watched hours of instructive YouTube videos on weekends, studying world-class drumlines and attempting to imitate their technique. I wrote solos and duets to develop my rudimental skills and learned popular orchestral excerpts to grow as a well-rounded musician. Recently, I composed a drumline cadence that will be performed by my high school at a marching band festival in the fall. In addition to performance and composition, I now provide private lessons and volunteer with the Boys and Girls Club to spread my love of music to others in my community.Although some of my experiences with basketball may appear anything but celebratory, they led me to discover my passion toward music. I now look back on these events not as failures, but as propitious occurrences that allowed me to uncover a true love central to my high school experience that otherwise may have been overlooked. \"}, {\"index\": 918, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] With forested hills open to exploration and a lake for boating and fishing, Spring Lake Park has become a second home to me. I come here regularly for a run, a bike ride, or a walk with my family. I have participated in community work days and had my Eagle Scout Service Project here. But Spring Lake has become more to me than the location of my dreams. I work here as a lifeguard at the Spring Lake Lagoon. When I am on duty, my body is hoisted up into the white, sunburnt chairs, and the lives of those in the musty water are now in my hands. This is my first job, and certainly the most important task in my life; as one of few open water lifeguards in Sonoma County, people trust me to save them in water with less than a foot of visibility.While the pressure of saving lives certainly gnaws away at me, I am revitalized by the surrounding environment. The rolling chaparral and mirroring lake offset the pressure of preserving the lives of those in the water. The towering redwoods and blanket of fog that enclose the sandy beach provide a sense of seclusion, where I am free from the influences of society. The encircling trails and nearby snack shack filled with lively people establish a cheerful atmosphere where I can leave behind my struggle to maintain healthy relationships with my family and friends. The challenging task to continue my commitment to athletics and further my intellectual pursuits is whisked away with the brisk breeze while I scan intently about the water in my chair, chewing on sunflower seeds, armed with a rescue tube and paddleboard, awaiting the menacing moment that demands a sprint into the clouded water.During rotation, which can last up to two hours, I ponder what defines me. The busy lagoon stirs with patrons vaulting into the water, playing pass, and roughhousing; their energetic squeals and splashes put the lagoon into a state of chaos. My pensive expression hides behind reflective blue shades where I relive the excitement of the child building sandcastles, the thrill of the friends partaking in a swim race, and the happiness of the toddler collecting rocks from the shallows. All the while I watch and anticipate the worst.Code Green: the phrase lifeguards announce over the intercoms at Spring Lake to indicate an emergency is in progress. Being in the break room while this happens means an all-out sprint with a 60 pound medical backpack across the lagoon. Adrenaline fuels me while bolting out onto the sand with it strapped on. The victim\\'s pulse, level of consciousness, blood pressure, and physical state among other vitals are all that matter. The conclusion of an emergency marks a transition from anxiety to tranquility and the day continues, as the next crisis looms.As the day winds down and the shadows creep across the lagoon, preparations for closing begin. All is silent when I carry the equipment in across the beach. The lagoon is empty. The patrons have packed up and vacated their once bustling picnic areas. Only footprints blemish the sand. All that is left is calm, motionless water and a crimson sunset, darkened by the redwood silhouettes. When the shadows recede and the sun reappears, I come back to find the sand neatly groomed and familiar equipment put back on the chairs, as if nothing had happened the day before. Thus, the cycle continues with the enriching environment and demanding job that maintain a delicate balance in my life.  \"}, {\"index\": 919, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] It\\'s not just about rhinestones, ribbons, and tutus. And it\\'s certainly not easy or cute. In fact, it\\'s remarkable how much sweat, hard work, and time goes into making ballet look effortless. I tolerate bruised toenails, muscle cramps, and raw blisters because of the fleeting moment when everything finally comes together onstage, but it all starts in the studio. From demi pli\\\\u00e9s at the barre at 4:30 on a Monday afternoon to final run-throughs that last until 9:30 on a Friday night, the studio is where I am able to refine my technique, express myself artistically, and become a character totally different from myself; it\\'s where I feel perfectly content.In the studio I\\'m not nervous that I\\'ll look stupid, mess up, or fall. I know that\\'s what practice is for. I\\'m not afraid of taking risks because risks are part of what it takes to perfect a challenging petite allegro combination or nail Kitri\\'s fiery and flirtatious attitude in her first act variation. I rarely get a new step or combination perfect on my first try. But with repetition and corrections from my teachers, I\\'m able to execute new choreography seamlessly. And by the time I get to the stage, the steps are so ingrained in my muscles that I no longer even have to think about them, and I can truly embody my character.Dancing allows me to hone a completely different set of skills I don\\'t use during the school day. While academics are purely intellectual, ballet requires a balance between artistry and strength. Mr. Schweikher\\'s junior Honors English class is a totally different world from Ms. Benson\\'s ballet class. In Mr. Schweikher\\'s class, the atmosphere is completely relaxed. Students offer ideas without raising their hands, we feed off of each other\\'s creativity, and all ideas, no matter how far-fetched, are appreciated. In that atmosphere I am encouraged and supported, and praise is not all that difficult to receive.Just a few hours later and six miles away, when Ms. Benson walks into the room, every dancer falls silent and gets up from a stretch to take her place at the barre. Outside of the studio, she may be sweet and encouraging, but when Ms. Benson teaches class, she means business. She is definitely not afraid to raise her voice (something I\\'ve never heard Mr. Schweikher do), and class is filled with criticism and corrections. And even though I know that receiving a correction from Ms. Benson means she sees potential in me as a dancer, sometimes it\\'s easy to get lost in all the negativity. Last week, for example, after she had been harping on me for days to test my balance in the middle of combinations, she suddenly screeched in the middle of a d\\\\u00e9gag\\\\u00e9s, \\'Ellie, if you don\\'t let go of the barre, you\\'re never going to improve!\\' She means well, but corrections like this can honestly be demoralizing. But it\\'s not true that all of her comments are negative. When I am drenched in sweat and pushing myself past the point of exhaustion, or I successfully apply a correction I\\'ve been working on for days, Ms. Benson will sometimes say, \\'Yes, Ellie! That\\'s it!\\'For me, praise in the studio is much more difficult to obtain than praise in the classroom, and that makes it so much more rewarding. As a dancer I am constantly forced to focus on my flaws in order to improve my technique, but knowing that someone who had such a prestigious ballet career recognizes my hard work and sees my potential encourages me to keep pushing forward. It may seem odd that I\\'m most content in the space where I\\'m most criticized, but that\\'s where I get to pursue what I love, and that\\'s why I dance. \"}, {\"index\": 920, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Here I was, standing in front of a timeless work of art. I could feel the footprints of millions of tourists from all over the world beneath my feet. This was a famous face, a priceless one, recognizable by almost every person who had ever heard the term \\'artwork.\\' And all I could think was, \\'Man, I\\'d like to get a selfie with the Mona Lisa.\\'Some people turned to look at me as I did it. I saw expressions ranging from amusement to bewilderment to outright disgust. I assumed the latter considered my act disrespectful toward da Vinci, the Louvre, or culture in general. Thinking of this made me wonder, \\'What exactly is culture?\\' I would later come to realize that culture is a fundamental part of my identity.I pondered the question as I toured the rest of the museum. Culture might refer to the Renaissance. It could be famous works of art, literature, or music. Maybe it was anything old that has withstood the test of time. I knew that did not define culture, though. The concept of culture was much broader than my descriptions. After all, I have read about a \\'technology culture\\' or \\'social media culture\\' that exists today, and neither refer to something old or traditional.I looked up the definition. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines culture as the act of developing the intellectual and moral faculties, especially by education. That did not satisfy me. I eventually realized my problem: I had been trying to define culture when in reality I simply wanted to know what the essence of culture is.Eventually I came to realize that one blanket statement could not explain the essence of culture. It seems odd that something so valued has no concrete explanation, but the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. Culture is meaningful, but on an individual level. Culture does not give value to people; people give value to culture.Some might frown upon the notion of a selfie with the Mona Lisa. They view me as an unappreciative child, a teenager who either cannot or does not comprehend the magnitude of the creation right in front of my eyes. To them I say, \\'Au contraire!\\'I took a selfie with da Vinci\\'s masterpiece because I do appreciate the culture behind it. What amused and intrigued me was the blending of culture in that one simple act. The modern day, 21st century technology fixation combined with this enlightened masterpiece of the Renaissance might appall others, but it enthralled me. I thought to myself, \\'What would da Vinci think if he knew what I was doing? Would he laugh? Be upset?\\' I would like to think that he would be flattered. Maybe he would even photobomb my selfie.Whether apparent or not, culture is always present in my life as a central part of my identity. My experiences with different forms of culture via travel, literature, art, and more have shaped me into the person I am today. However, I know that the more I experience, the more I want. Culture is almost like a healthy addiction, one that fuels my desire to learn and especially my passion for travel. Because of this fascination I am determined to take advantage of opportunities to experience life from many different viewpoints and keep an open mind. Above all, it has ingrained in me the idea that there is always another perspective. A narrow mind is blinding; if you constantly gaze through the same looking glass, you will never see the entire ocean.I might never know the answer to my question. That does not bother me, though. I take pride in the fact that culture is meaningful to me by allowing me to express myself and find joy in small, simple acts, such as taking a photograph with a portrait of a mysterious woman. \"}, {\"index\": 921, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Bleary-eyed and sullen, I blinked, squeezed my eyelids shut, and blinked again before managing to fully open both eyes. The dissonant notes struck on my brother\\'s keyboard jolted me into consciousness. Thanks to Alex, I never needed an alarm to wake up for school.Living with autism isn\\'t easy. Living with a brother who has it isn\\'t any easier. Countless parties and playdates were missed taking Alex to his therapy appointments. Homework was done to the discordant tunes he churned out from his piano during his music therapy. I envied the peace and quiet that could be found in my friends\\' homes, for no tranquility could be found in mine. The perpetual cacophony of video game soundtracks, YouTube videos, and Dr. Seuss audiobooks gave the house a crowded feel.Yet it was a lonely experience for me. Even with four people in the house, I felt like I was living alone. With my father at work and my mother devoting all her attention to Alex, there was no one to guide me through mountains of homework or help me through boy troubles. Though Alex and I bonded, often times over Mario Kart, I regretted not being able to understand his thoughts and emotions. Unfortunately, the communication barrier prevented Alex from connecting with his peers as well. They jeered at him, mocking the unintelligible string of sounds that spilled from his mouth and the spasmodic way he flung his hands. Yet while I attempted to control my anger and explain autism to the middle schoolers, this scene played like a tape recorder, over and over again. The realization that I could not constantly protect my brother stung more than anything.Alex and his predicament are what inspired me to focus on computer engineering and programming. Because his communication with the rest of society is so limited, I am determined to create a device intended to facilitate his social interactions. On a selfish level, I can\\'t wait for him to be able to tell me about his day or to laugh at a joke. I eagerly await the day in which he can crack a joke of his own or join in dinnertime family conversations. On a more important note, such a device would allow my brother to expand his horizons and move past the childish torment that has plagued him for so many years. I\\'ve always been told everyone deserves a voice. Why should my brother be denied one?When all is said and done, Alex has done just as much for me as I have for him. For one thing, after waking up around 6AM everyday I\\'ve definitely become a morning person. Being alert and having a clear mind helps with early morning exams and out-of-town math competitions, especially when the other students are too sluggish to think. From preparing snacks for him to navigating his educational games website, I\\'m also left with less time to finish my homework than my peers; consequently, I\\'ve become much more efficient with my work and better at time management. The most important skill he has given me, though, is the ability to speak up for myself (which came naturally from speaking out for him). Up until high school, I had always been extremely quiet and withdrawn. Even if I disagreed with the other students in my group, I still silently went along with them, feeling too uncomfortable to argue. Now I find it natural to take charge in group projects and don\\'t hesitate to voice my opinion. All fear of raising my hand in class, giving public speeches, and conversing with new people vanished. While I am sad that Alex and I will soon part ways as I head to college, I find solace in the fact that no matter where I am, and what I am doing, Alex will always be there, shaping who I am, and will become. \"}, {\"index\": 922, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] As we approached the gray Smoky Mountains, they appeared cold, unwelcoming, and void of life. The morning itself was gray and surrounding us was the curling fog that blurred color and shape. Shadows of vague familiarity, the Smoky Mountains before us were a stark contrast from the captivating mountains portrayed in the brochures that my senior class had anticipated seeing.Regardless of this disillusionment, I was thrilled to begin the hike towards Clingmans Dome. As I looked upon the trail at my feet, the stories my father so often told me came to life. I saw him blazing the trails of France\\'s towering Mont-Blanc, full of boyhood brashness and confidence, his only companions a guitar and a lightweight backpack. Passing a small ravine, I saw him spelunking with a few of his friends in a shallow cave, risking their lives by doing so during the spring rains. I pictured the fear and excitement in their eyes as they raced against time and the rise of the water, toying with fate. As a child, these stories became my ambitions, and my father the embodiment of the curious adventurer I so longed to become.These aspirations were suddenly lost to reality and transformed into less tangible dreams when my family and I moved to America. Growing up in the rolling hills of middle Tennessee, I had to compromise these dreams and appease myself with the \\'mountains\\' accessible to me. Due to the ease of hiking trails on merely large, forested hills, I was unsatisfied and felt a false sense of accomplishment when I reached these \\'peaks.\\' Now, on the footsteps of the Smoky Mountains, enthralled by the beckoning promise of fulfillment, I was prepared to vanquish the mountain of my lifelong dreams. I realized too quickly though, that I had grossly miscalculated the distance of the deceptively difficult trail. The poise I bore during the first few hours was diminished by the pesky mosquitoes, hindering sweat, and thick underbrush I combated along the way. The silent harmony of the woods was gone and dissonance took its place with the grumble of regret and shouts of complaint ringing in the air from the group.Even so, we pressed on, and the objections died down. There was no turning back. With this acceptance, the silence once more flourished and we became conscious of the beauty our natural surrounding boasted. Mesmerized by the scenery I had neglected, I became less centralized and strove to hear more, see more, feel more. Several hours later, we reached Clingmans Dome and rejoiced, praising one another with drained smiles on our faces that glowed with elation.The arduous journey was a test of maturity and resilience, and we had passed. Looking out over the mountain I had conquered, I felt a new sense of gratification that no hill I climbed before had given me. Like my father, who ascended the most perilous mountains and persevered despite nature\\'s tests, I knew that I could no longer satisfy myself with hills in my life just because my dreams are deemed impossible by circumstance or environment. Despite any obstacle, I knew that I would be capable of scaling mountains of adversity with a smile on my face. Though each step taken is paved with sweat and tears, it leads the yearning hiker closer to the peak, which is all the more satisfying and valuable due to the hardships that had to be overcome. True accomplishment lay in the advanced coursework I chose, physical limitations I surpassed, and social ideals and inhibitions I challenged, mountains I pushed myself to embrace, despite the daunting endeavors. Only here, where I decry the impossible and push my own boundaries, could I experience true contentment. Although I had reached the summit of this understanding, I knew that this was not a culminating point, but another step towards further trails of trial and achievement in my life. \"}, {\"index\": 923, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 924, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The Value of CreativityMany fall into the trap of believing that learning only comes from the classroom. We are educated in traditional classroom settings, but perhaps the most important lessons come from outside formal curriculum. As an underclassman, I constantly found myself focusing solely on the academic side of learning. While this was beneficial to the development of my GPA and critical thinking skills, I struggled with the fact that my learning experience was incomplete. In my junior year, I realized I was lacking a skill: creativity. Now, I quench my desire to learn not only through understanding class curriculum, but also through being creative. Here, I am going to outline my journey towards creative expression.As a child, I was full of \\'wonder\\'. I remember performing my original symphonies with pots and pans, creating colorful \\'masterpieces\\' with crayons kits, and thinking of the most ingenious theorem, which I would excitedly explain to my mother. One of my favorite artists, Pablo Picasso, stated \\'every child is an artist\\' and \\'the problem is staying an artist when you grow up.\\' I feel like I fell prey to this problem. As I moved through school, I lost my original sense of creativity. I felt molded by rigorous curricula and densely packed schedules where I was rewarded for completing assignments, but not for showing creativity. Sometimes I would stumble upon an old drawing I had done or a story I had written. At these times, I momentarily became nostalgic. I would be inspired to create again; however, this spark would soon die out, lasting only for a matter of days as the responsibilities and pressures of my classroom-focused world quickly reabsorbed me. Thankfully, I recently began to break this cycle.In my Junior year, I enrolled in two classes that positively affected my development: Honors British Literature and AP Art History. I figured British Literature would be a class where we just studied the catalogue of English poetry and prose. While we did do this, I got much more out of the class than understanding Beowulf\\'s ring structure or Macbeth\\'s melancholic behavior. When we began to discuss romantic writers in this class, I found myself simultaneously discussing romantic painters in Art History. I saw connections between the paintings we were studying and the poetry we were reading in the different classes. For example, I had always admired both Francisco Goya and William Wordsworth\\'s artistic styles and deliveries. When I understood that Goya\\'s emphasis on the importance of youth, shown in his painting Saturn Devouring One of His Children, is reflected in William Wordsworth\\'s \\'child is the father of man\\' paradox, I felt edified. This realization came from my thinking beyond what the curriculum required me to know. I effectively began to synthesize the two worlds of knowledge and creation. By realizing that art is an extremely intellectual feat, I saw the world differently. I started on my journey to become an artist.Recognizing the importance of creativity has affected every facet of my life. Currently I produce jazz and hip-hop inspired instrumentals. I also paint pictures of landscapes with watercolor. Tapping into my creative urges has shown me that education expands beyond the school setting; it is a synthesis of intellect and artistry. Now I gain more out of my educational experiences both inside and outside of the classroom. As creative thinkers continue to change the modern worlds of technology and business, I hope to find a college that will nurture and reward my creative expression. \"}, {\"index\": 925, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Adulthood, in my mind, is not in rooted in age or some trivial event that marks some occasion, graduation or something of the like. It is the acceptance of responsibility of oneself and people who depend on you. To me, the event that transforms one into adult is taking a long walk off a short pier of life; being thrust into life of altruism and responsibility; moving into transcendence from the common self-centered ideals of children. An adult is one who repays the debts to society that they amass as children with positive attributions.Adulthood for me began the day my father was hospitalized for a form of arrhythmia that occurs randomly from electromagnetic stimulation. This fateful moment of diagnosis plunged me into the life of an adult when I was in eighth grade. No longer worrying about the common gossip of the middle school lunchroom, I worried about my father battling some condition of which I had never heard. My emotions became devoted to my younger siblings and my mind to understanding the condition. To my siblings, I became an adult; the one to whom they asked questions, the one they could count on. My homework was the amalgamation of doing my school work, helping with my siblings\\' educational needs, and taking care of some responsibilities of the household.After the diagnosis, I became like a third parent, taking responsibility for the runoff tasks that needed to be done. From that moment, I became a master of multi-tasking and time budgeting, getting not only my school work completed but also my responsibilities to the household, and the family construction business. As my father was able to do much less than before, I became a crutch for him and my mother to lean on. I remain solely focused on being strong not for myself but for my siblings and family who have come to rely on me. Through this I have never stopped to feel sorry for myself or let my schoolwork slack. Instead I invested my time in researching arrhythmias and learning CPR in preparation for the worst case scenario.In my junior year, this skill became invaluable and what I thank for having my father here today. The day his heart stopped and my CPR training paid off, was the day that I learned the fragility of life and my addiction to helping others. My addiction is not to the accolades associated with the helping of others but the simple fact of knowing that individuals make a difference, and this is the addiction that keeps me fervently focused on my education. As education is the most useful tool in ones arsenal when attempting to help people.These fateful days keep me forever appreciative of the time I have and the strength one can pull from others. The days of practicing martial arts with my father have become even more precious I as reflect on having limited time with him. This is what adulthood means to me; having the strength to carry on despite the circumstances, caring for others and their needs, and appreciating all of the small moments in life. These make me an adult, regardless of age, these qualities make an adult, and these are the qualities thrust upon you at some point in your life, even if it is through a fairly normal experience. \"}, {\"index\": 926, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] An East Indian child bride at the age of nine, my great-grandmother grew up in the rural Caribbean. My other great-grandmother ran her family\\'s general store in Covington, Georgia. The two sides of my family could not be more different. Though originally East Indian, my maternal family is from Guyana, a former British colony and Caribbean nation between Venezuela and Suriname. Later, in the 1980s, they migrated to New York, but most of them now live in Jersey City, New Jersey, which is urban, diverse, and made up mostly of immigrants struggling to make it in the United States. My paternal family is Jewish and from Winter Park, a small, suburban, affluent, mostly white town in Florida. I\\'ve always felt that my heritage made me complicated, like a jigsaw puzzle containing pieces that do not quite fit together.My travels have helped me to understand both my heritage and my privilege. In 2009, I visited my mother\\'s home country for the first time. We went to the island of Leguan, where a few of my relatives still live. They are rice farmers, as members of my family have been since the occupation of the British in the 19th century. Ever since that time, women have lacked rights in the farming society. Behind my great uncle\\'s modest house, I saw a dark-skinned young girl washing dishes. My great uncle referred to her simply as \\'Blackie\\'s Daughter.\\' She had no name and she never spoke. This girl was so different from me, yet our racial heritage is so similar. Although I am half Guyanese, I worry that my white side dominates my personality and lifestyle.Because I have lived in the United States for my entire life, I am culturally different from my mother and her relatives. In this sense, I will always be closer to my father\\'s side because they have also grown up American. For our entire lives, we\\'ve celebrated Thanksgiving rather than Diwali, watched baseball rather than cricket, and eaten bagels rather than naan. Ironically, I outwardly seem to fit in better with my mother\\'s side of the family because I look as if I am fully Indian.I do not truly fit into either side of my family. I can\\'t relate to the foreign culture of my Guyanese relatives. I will never be able to speak with a Caribbean accent or understand certain Guyanese idioms and jokes. The culture of my father\\'s side of the family is more familiar to me but my appearance will never fit in with my white American relatives because of my brown skin and black hair. When I spend time with my blonde cousins, strangers are often shocked and confused when we say that we are full first cousins by blood.As a little girl, I never gave much thought to the fact that I was darker than my relatives. But as I\\'ve grown older, I\\'ve learned how meaningful these differences are. When my parents started dating, my grandmother disapproved because my mother was non-Jewish and non-white. Unlike my parents, I\\'ve been fortunate to grow up in the progressive city of Berkeley, California, where mixed race couples are common. The relaxed and quirky town helped me to accept my heritage.I love my diverse background because it has given me the opportunity to learn from people all over the world. Leguan, Jersey City, Winter Park, and Berkeley have all shaped me. Hanukkah, beef curry and Telegraph Avenue are all parts of me. I equally belong at colorful Indian weddings and soulful Passover Seders. When my parents met, contrasting worlds collided, producing a Jewish, Guyanese Berkeleyite with a passion for travelling. Although the cultures of the two sides of my family have influenced me, neither side defines me. I am both a mix of my ancestors and someone completely different. \"}, {\"index\": 927, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] It\\'s 6:00am, and the face of Robin Williams summons me from my dreams. It\\'s Mr. Keating. Again. As my mind clears I rush through my morning routine, and at 6:40am, 15 minutes before the bus comes, my headphones fill with country music. I sit on the fringe of my living room and let my world decelerate until it breaks to a stop. For the next few minutes, seconds become hours as I find myself in contemplation, sitting on a rough, stiff, green mini-couch. It\\'s 19 years old, plus whatever time it saw before being thrown into the landfill. I can imagine my father, a penniless immigrant student, salvaging the priceless furniture from the dump. The image is vivid, but the couch pricks me back into reality when my skin meets its coarse edges; to my right is the common household junk that families, often with too much consumer power and realistically little need, fill their houses with when even time starts to become an excess resource. At this instant, enclosed between my past and present, I do feel rather content.As I sit there with my deplorable posture my mind transcends its general course of meticulous, intellectual thought. I station my consciousness in a moment where yin and yang are so evenly balanced that the constraints and freedoms of life neutralize each other.In times like these I feel a sort of uncomfortable shift from my life\\'s motto\\\\u2014 to \\'Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\\'\\\\u2014 because the voracious pursuit of skills and knowledge has always been the absolute north of my existential compass. Of course, I have tangential pleasures\\\\u2014 religious Sunday Night Football tailgates, Netflix binging, and biweekly pick-up soccer are among the many\\\\u2014 but in any given scenario these come second to learning and thinking. So for an individual who spends summers interning with incredibly presitigious institutions like the United Nations or Johns Hopkins University and his extra time during school years enrolled in Edx.org MOOC courses from Harvard, Rice, and UT Austin, why do I so consistently and determinedly sacrifice my precious time on the alter of peace and self-reflection? Why at such a strange time of day? The answer lies in the view outside my window. This is the time of day when the moon passes its reign over the skies to the sun, the time between my time at home and my time at school, the time in transition. For me it\\'s a reminder to always seize what\\'s in the crevices, the smaller things. It\\'s a reminder that greatness doesn\\'t come in discrete intervals, but rather through continuity, because it\\'s the ability to make the most of the opportunities in between that divides those who succeed from those that dream of succeeding.Behind this valuable self-caveat, however, lies something else, something more profound. As I see the sun and moon, I take time to rationally assess the delicate equilibrium I represent both in history and time. I remind myself that the world can be very ruthless, but equally fantastical. I see that no matter how focused, dedicated, or curious I am, there will always be more exciting things to try, more skills to be learned, even once I have escaped the trivial concerns of high school life. I see that true satisfaction doesn\\'t lie in which university\\'s name I can flaunt, how many digits there are in my paycheck, or similar paradigms of success. I see that it instead lies in how many verses I may contribute to the powerful play, or how many lives have breathed easier because I have lived. I see, as Mr. Keating reminds me every morning, that success is contingent upon being able to \\'remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a different way.\\' \"}, {\"index\": 928, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Describe a place or environment where you are perfectly content. What do you do or experience there, and why is it meaningful to you? (250-650 words)My desk is home to my imagination. Of the many places I feel content, only my beloved desk brings the power of solitude and allows me to focus on whatever I set my mind to achieve. From creating origami to studying higher calculus and topology in my free time, my desk provides a platform for innovation and creativity. This desk has made my life richer. It has awakened me to an idea that in everything I do, there should be this sort of dedication, a striving to do more than simply complete a task and an urge to actually make something that expresses the limits of my personal ability. Where I live, such aspirations seem strange or out of place. Most of my family and peers struggle to see the point in accomplishing something as a result of passion rather than for grades. I see the world differently. I\\'ve always wanted to learn everything there is to learn in the world in depth. From astronomy to chemical engineering to investment banking, knowledge attracts me and overwhelms me with this sudden passion to master each esoteric piece of information.This passion impacts every second of my life. On the most unusual level, I convinced my family to let me drag them to New York for an international origami convention, so they could watch me learn new models and show my own ones to some of the most revered origami artists in the world. On a daily basis, this difference expresses itself in the ironic comedy of high school. No one quite understands why I have equations written all over my binders, why I carry massive physics textbooks through the hallways, why I doodle complex geometric solids along the margins of my notes, or why I laugh with terror while reading the dictionary sized novel, Under The Dome, as Stephen King portrays yet another thrilling apocalyptic situation. The only place where I feel truly at peace, with no one to question my eclectic interests and passions, is my desk. Whether studying partial differential equations or folding a 120 piece origami model, as long as I have my desk, my space to create, nothing is impossible. \"}, {\"index\": 929, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Every child has heard it. \\'You have to clean your room because it\\'s my room. You\\'re just staying in it. You can\\'t do what you want.\\' Or after a fight with the parents they say \\'You\\'re so selfish. I\\'ve given you so many things. But I bought them. They\\'re mine. I can easily take them away.\\' And then after one of those one of those fights, or when it\\'s raining or snowing out, or when I need to clear my head, or when I just don\\'t want to do my homework just yet, I take the five year old, flattening basketball that my dad keeps reminding me to put air into and the millionth set of cheap ear buds that will break in a month I\\'ve owned, and go out into the driveway with my old, blue basketball hoop set up there.Shooting hoops on a home goal is miles apart from playing varsity basketball. Varsity is stressful, practices every day, every game counts, sacrifice, sweat, time spent doubled over because I\\'m out of shape and can\\'t breathe. On my home goal it\\'s just me, the ball, music playing from my phone in my sweatpants pocket even though it\\'s 80 degrees out, the hoop, and my own thoughts. There\\'s no rush to beat a buzzer, nine other people on the floor with me, constant screaming from parents in the bleachers, nothing. I can focus. I can think. I can get away from my school life and my home life at the same time just by being five feet outside my house. I don\\'t even feel so out of shape anymore. Granted, it\\'s not perfect. I can\\'t say how many times my ball has been caught in the net or in the rim or under one of the cars in the garage and I\\'ve had to rescue it using an old staff from my earlier days of practicing Taekwondo. Often enough my ball will bounce off the black base and launch into the grass, or into one of the bushes in the front lawn and I\\'ll have to fish it out. But I don\\'t care. I\\'m happy.As it gets later and colder out, one of my parents pokes their head out the garage door and tells me to come back in. I beg for five more minutes, as I did the day before, and the day before that. One of them pokes their head back out three minutes later. I make sure to remind them I still have two more minutes, because \\'the song I\\'m playing has (x) amount of time left.\\' The head disappears. It reappears two minutes later. (I\\'m coming mom. Jesus, it\\'s not like we have a street lamp right in front of our house or anything.) I put my ball away in the garage and come in the house. My mom calls me as I\\'m running upstairs to my room. The door. I forgot to lock the door again.My hoop has gone through constant wear and tear. I\\'ve destroyed and replaced the net at least once a year. The backboard\\'s been broken.

I don\\'t have to talk to anyone while I\\'m out with it. Things have changed in my life, my friends, school, me, but the basket stays the same as it ever was. It\\'s where I do my best thinking. It\\'s where I can set aside my worries and problems and just shoot. It\\'s simple.

You\\'ve done this more than a hundred times before. Notes? Check. Water bottle? Check. Take a sip. Now look up and get ready to launch into your first argument.But wait. Is my skirt too short - will they notice? And is my shirt too low-cut? I should have worn a cardigan. Remember, Sarah, drop your voice down low; no, lower.In ninth grade, I started as a novice in Lincoln Douglas or LD - one-on-one - debate. I was humbled and petrified. Still I was cheered to be part of a large group of supportive young women. More than half of the novice debaters were young women and a number of them performed brilliantly.By tenth grade, I moved into the junior varsity and varsity ranks of LD debate. This was a much more serious endeavor. In one of my first varsity rounds, I faced and was annihilated by a formidable high-ranking male debater who ran a complex debate case against me. \\'Contention three: the ontologically dead lack a collective epistemic viewpoint;\\' he might as well have been speaking a foreign language. After the round, I did what comes naturally to me: I cried deeply and dramatically - in public. Fellow debaters stepped around me as if I had a communicable disease.Then I started to notice. My fellow male debaters and some of the judges had begun to comment on what I was wearing and the pitch of my voice. Participation by women in varsity debate dropped to about 30%, and few women now made it to the final rounds of major tournaments. For those few women, I started to hear the jokes: they must have used their feminine wiles to get that far.As I became increasingly alienated from the debate community, during the spring of my sophomore year I founded Debate Girls 2015, an online forum that connects female LD debaters throughout the country (I like to think of us as the nerdier, teenage version of Lena Dunham\\'s Girls). As the administrator of the forum, I have been able to witness and help shape the discussions among the women.There is vast agreement in the forum that the lower participation and achievement of women in varsity debate is attributable, in part, to a form of sexism. I have witnessed that through the negative comments I have received about my clothing and voice and the barbed jokes told about successful women. I also noted a more insidious problem: coaches and judges have a view of a model debater - dressed formally, with a well-modulated voice, making slashing verbal attacks - that naturally leads them to favor male over female debaters. On top of this, I pointed out an issue shared by many female debaters: many of us have internalized the view of greater male suitability for debate. This view allows us to rationalize losses in tournaments to male debaters with big reputations as being tolerable, even inevitable.I have started to fight back and have asked the Debate Girls to join me. I have made it my business to mentor and create opportunities for my team\\'s best young female performers. I have also insisted that strong presentations by women like me that are substantive but less combative receive high scores, and that low representation of women in final rounds should be a cause for concern. Most importantly, I have vociferously advocated that more women coaches need to be hired by schools and that more women judges need to be employed in tournaments. That way our (higher-pitched) voices are more likely to be heard fairly.Okay, Sarah, breathe. You\\'ve heard their exhortations: \\'Lean in.\\' Assume a \\'power pose.\\'No, Sarah. Relax.

I was trying to combine cells from the body\\'s immune system with the body\\'s fat cells, all within a petri dish. As an intern at Rockefeller University, I was working on obesity research, mentored by an expert in the field. I knew this would be an especially rewarding experience for me. As it would happen, my internship at Rockefeller marked my coming-of-age within the scientific community.With the smell of sterilizing ethanol on my gloves, I worked intently, trying to coax pre-fat cells to mature into fully-developed fat cells. I had combed the literature, tried adding different reagents to the cell cultures, but nothing seemed to work. So after fruitless hours of trial and error, I welcomed my mentor\\'s invitation: \\'Let\\'s go out to lunch, your choice!\\'The choice was made in a heartbeat: Num Pang, my favorite Cambodian sandwich shop. Although the shop isn\\'t even close to our laboratory, I told my mentor that he wouldn\\'t regret the journey. \\'Their Ginger Barbecue Brisket sandwich is incomparable.\\' We were both ready to indulge in a well-deserved sandwich excursion.Leaving the wooded oasis of the University, we took the subway downtown. As we swayed side-to-side on the packed 6-train, my mentor opened up to me about his research. \\'As a young postdoc I would stare through the microscope for hours. The longer I looked, the more I realized that the cells I observed were unlike any cells I had seen before. Though other scientists doubted me, I eventually proved that I had discovered a new kind of cell-the dendritic cell-which plays an essential role in the body\\'s immune system.\\'After clearing his throat he asked me, \\'How did you discover the Num Pang Sandwich Shop?\\'I had not thought about it as a \\'discovery\\', but as I recalled the circumstances that led me to Num Pang, his description seemed apt. I began to tell him the story.\\'One night after working in the lab, I found myself at Grand Central Terminal, not yet ready to go home. I was struck by the impulse to walk around Midtown, when suddenly my stomach began rumbling. By chance, or perhaps by miracle, I encountered a large orange rooster, watching over a bold orange sign which read: \\'Num Pang Sandwich Shop\\'. Somehow it spoke to me; there was something different about that shop, but at the moment I couldn\\'t understand what it was. I jumped into the long line outside the shop without fully knowing the reason. Once my food arrived, I knew my intuition had been correct: the pickled carrots, cilantro, chili mayo, and warm, garlicky baguette were all the evidence that I needed.\\'\\'Wow, that sounds like a remarkable finding,\\' my mentor responded, with the same enthusiasm with which he had told me about his discovery.After lunch, I re-examined my petri dishes with a newfound focus. I was encouraged by the way my mentor could find our \\'discoveries\\' to be so similar. One of the cell cultures had subtle irregularities which I had previously ignored; this time I noticed faint outlines of the newly formed fat cells I was trying to grow. I had treated that culture with pioglitazone, a common diabetes drug. I knew that I had finally found the missing piece of my research puzzle.Whether it\\'s a new cell culture technique or the city\\'s best barbecue brisket sandwich, amazing discoveries are often \\'hidden\\' right in front of us. All it takes is an open mind, hard work-and sometimes a little luck-to find them out. The summer I interned at Rockefeller truly marked my scientific coming-of-age. With my mentor\\'s help and encouragement, I realized that I have the ability to make important discoveries. That was when I knew I would be a scientist. \"}, {\"index\": 932, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I gently poked my half-asleep sister, wondering how she could want to miss such a story. It was a precious chronicle that my mom had decided to tell that night, about her youth in the small village of Francistown. She paused and stared at the fire, and I follow suited and noticed the dying fire. I was momentarily distracted. I realized it was the perfect time to pull the prank I had planned since the trip began, so I volunteered to get wood. After pretending to go toward the wood pile I surreptitiously put on my mask--half Shrek and half Santa--and slowly crawled back to the bonfire\\\\u2026When I was younger, my family was the typical Setswana family: my mom provided food, not conversation; my sisters stopped the petty fights between us siblings; and my brothers ate and complained. I did not like this conformity to the Setswana type of family; I wanted my mother to talk about our family history, her teenage days, and her first love. I wanted my sisters to guide me on my daily behavior, my brothers to give me advice on how to grow up a good man in the absence of my father. But all these were impossible as we were conforming to Setswana culture and also living apart, reuniting only for Christmas. After Christmas everyone would go their separate ways, and we would go back to the tradition of talking through the phone, sending each other emails, and sporadic Skyping.We needed more time to bond as a family, and even though I was the last born and only twelve years old, I decided to plan a family camp out. So I asked my friend for camping equipment. I then made sure I packed a good supply of food, not forgetting the family\\'s favorite snack, roasted salted peanuts.  During a school road trip I had seen a beautiful green sprawling along a fresh water lake, and I was sure that it would be a perfect camping spot\\\\u2026When I came back to the fire with my mask no one was around the fire. \\'You are the seeker!\\' yelled my mum in the pitch dark night. They had noticed my intention to scare them and had decided to turn the tables, making me the seeker of an impromptu game of hide and seek. \\'How am I supposed to find all of you in this dark and why I am the seeker?\\' I protested. Secretly, though, my heart was joyful. This is what I had hoped for: a fun, relaxed family that lived in the moment. With a dancing heart I ran to the hardly visible small tent, grabbed the flashlight and started \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018seeking\\'.After a tough search, occasionally slipping on the lakeside gray pebbles, we gathered around the fire again to continue the stories. My mom was careful not to reveal a lot or she would run out of stories to tell over the next five days. The ice that had been in my family was starting to melt, over the last three or so days, it was easy to approach my brother and ask him about how he treated his girlfriend. I accepted that my father might not come back, but I could find ways to fill that void by looking up to my brother.When I organized the first camp out, little did I know that I would be pioneering a family tradition. Camping has brought excitement to our family, and every year we wait in anticipation wondering which stories mom is going to share and who is going to be the seeker. \\'The seeker\\' has become not only the person who searches in the dark, but also what we call the organizer of the camping.

It all just felt wrong - the walls\\' oaky brown now appeared petrified; the slate-greyness of the chairs felt forced.

It faces the Chesapeake Bay, looking over a stretch of grass that slopes down to the water. On a clear morning, I can see the ever-moving line of cars cross the Bay Bridge to the north, watch the sleepy towns on Maryland\\'s Eastern Shore twinkle to life, and follow the path of a crab boat as it hauls in its cargo before dawn. To the south, I can see an expanse of open water that leads to the mouth of the Bay, and to the Atlantic Ocean.For a few months each year, before it gets too dark, the sunlight spills over the horizon and paints the sky in vibrant orange, delicate pink and soft, creamy yellow, fading to a deep, velvety purple-black at the top of the sky.

My stomach churned, half-expecting to be turned away, told that my acceptance to MIT Launch had been a mistake. Yet my heart was anxious to meet my forty-one fellow entrepreneurs.Within forty-eight hours, my stunningly dissimilar venture team was assembled - a graphic designer, a marketer, and me, the engineer. Our first challenge was to build a Styrofoam chair sturdy enough to hold 150 pounds. A crumpled ball of duct tape, two Band-Aids, and forty minutes later, we had built a shoddy-looking chair that toppled at the lightest touch.The loss left me a little unnerved. I tried to comfort myself; it was only a small challenge, and we were a new team. With better planning, the remainder of the competition would be ours. The next week, we kept working as we did before, childishly put off by the fact that we could not partner with our friends. We stormed out of rooms and ignored each other in the hallways. When our initial ranks were announced, we were placed eleventh out of the eleven teams.That evening, I organized a team dinner. Our table started out with uncomfortable silence, and the conversation made its way to our competition and our poor performance thus far. I steered the discussion towards why we were all at MIT Launch to help the group realize that we were all working towards a common goal: to successfully launch a start-up. Over the course of the meal, that shared purpose brought us together. Getting to know one another outside the start-up, we became individuals with ambitions, weaknesses, and strengths. We started to develop respect for each other. Coming back to our team room, I wrote up the milestones other teams had achieved and ours. Staring at our blank column, we had a choice to make.Our team room became plastered with reminders, deadlines, and words that made us smile. Instead of slammed doors, compromises, though grudgingly, were achieved. Gradually, the collaboration became more natural. Our landing site was crafted in a few hours; our Indiegogo campaign was born a few days later. Amidst team dinners, elevator pitches, coffee runs, and venture cafes, four weeks blurred by, and proof of market-demand in hand, we were pitching to investors after moving up the ranks.Murphy\\'s Law states that everything that can go wrong will go wrong; Launch was certainly a testament to that. During our final presentation, even our clicker malfunctioned. Just one week before, one of our team members had to abruptly leave the program. Coming into MIT Launch, I believed I had a foolproof plan to entrepreneurial success with timelines set for each goal; I kept trying to adapt it as obstacles came up, condensing or stretching out the timelines. The rigidity of committing upfront to a four-week plan left me scrambling at every set back. In my third iteration, I decided to throw away the rigid planning and adopt a flexible approach. By quickly adapting to unexpected challenges as they came, I developed the agility essential to entrepreneurship - an approach I have stored in my toolkit.Coming into the program, I believed I was ready for challenges, that I had accepted failure as a natural occurrence, but in reality, I was terrified of losing. When I came up against setback after setback, I was paralyzed until I started perceiving failures not as personal inadequacies but as guiding lights. Ninety percent of startups fail. Probability suggests CollabWear will not make it either. While I am still somewhat scared, I will continue to push hard, log sleepless nights, and adapt as I go. \"}, {\"index\": 937, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Sophomore year. Danbury, Connecticut. The nauseating fumes of hairspray fill my lungs. Little girls in glittery eye makeup and bedazzled dresses crowd into the rink. It\\'s the first skating competition of the season, and I\\'ve just moved up to a new level. To me, my entire routine amounts solely to landing the dreaded Axel --which, by the way, I\\'ve never performed with in a competition before this day.The Axel is a rite of passage in competitive figure skating. Since it requires additional half-rotation, it takes most skaters years to land this jump. The world of recreational figure skating is divided into two distinct groups: those who \\'have\\' their Axel and those who don\\'t. Skaters who are never able to cross over to the elite class are doomed to a lifetime of monotonous single rotation jumps.With my mind fixated on the importance of the Axel, I take the ice and get into my opening position. From the moment my music begins, all I can think about is that one jump. There is no audience, no coach, no school, no world outside of that Axel. Nothing else matters, only that one fleeting moment.Thanks to my severe case of tunnel vision, when the time comes to make the jump, I find myself so nervous that I\\'m not even thinking about moving my muscles correctly anymore. So, I fall. Hard. I get up quickly and skate the rest of my routine with a half-hearted smile plastered on my face, but I already know it\\'s over. Fighting back tears, I run to the locker room to wallow in my misery. I failed. I\\'m an embarrassment.Every mistake used to seem like the end of the world to me. For months, I would pray each night that I would do my best in figure skating competitions, field hockey games, school -everything, really. I didn\\'t ask to win or be the best -no, that would be far too demanding. I simply implored that God grant me the favor of not making so many mistakes. I thought I was being reasonable enough, but what I didn\\'t understand was that mistakes are a necessary part of life, and not an entirely negative one.Despite my incessant prayers, I was, much to my chagrin, not perfect in everything I did. So, I continued making mistakes, and I continued thinking there was something wrong with me each time I did.However, at the following competition, when I skated a clean program and still placed 8th out of 12, something clicked.I did my best, but it wasn\\'t good enough. And this time, I finally realized, it was kind of alright. I still laughed that night when my friends and I got stuck at the top of the Ferris wheel in the rain. I still returned with good memories of that trip. I still felt excited to get back on the ice the next week. Life went on.It took quite a few more falls for me to really begin to accept the idea that failure isn\\'t always so awful --and accepting failure means so much more than just repressing the urge to have a complete meltdown after a botched skating competition. It means realizing that life isn\\'t meant to be taken so seriously all the time, that perfection is not always expected or required, and that, with a new perspective, mistakes can become some of life\\'s greatest teachers in resilience.I won\\'t pretend that I\\'m not embarrassed when I do miss a field hockey goal, fall in competition, or stumble over my words during a presentation. However, I no longer live confined by the barbed wire boundaries of my comfort zone, paralyzed by the crippling fear of failure. Now, I am able to readily take risks, and even jump outside of my comfort zone, knowing that every mistake is not, in fact, my own personal doomsday. \"}, {\"index\": 938, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] When I\\'m 70 feet below the surface of the ocean, living only by the metal tank connected to my mouth by a single hose, I\\'m at peace.

There\\'s not even anything I can do about my seasickness. \\'Go sit in the front of the boat and look at the horizon,\\' the divemasters say. Nope, that just delays the inevitable. \\'Take some Bonine,\\' my dad will say. Is it ironic that the anti-seasickness medicine has a taste that nearly makes me throw up, even on dry land? \\'Raspberry flavor\\'? Try \\'chalky, bitter, nausea-in-a-pill flavor.\\' I even tried the home remedy of sucking on ginger. That lasted for maybe 15 seconds before it ended up overboard, along with the cereal I\\'d had for breakfast.Nonetheless, I keep taking that stomach-churning boat ride, because eventually, the boat stops.Soon, I\\'m suited up and waddling ever-so-gracefully to the back of the boat. I stand at the edge, inflate my BC (Buoyancy Compensator) with air, put the regulator in my mouth, and step forward. Immediately, I\\'m engulfed in the clear, bubbly water. I always welcome the cold: it pushes the nausea away, washing away the sweat. I have no idea which way is up, but it doesn\\'t matter: The inflated BC will pull me to the surface. When it does, I signal the divemaster that I\\'m ok, and I descend. As I release the air from the BC, everything becomes right with the world.I watch the number on my depth gauge continue to rise as I sink, reaching 70 feet within a minute. I\\'m sitting on the bottom, no longer even aware of the nausea; I\\'m too busy watching the schools of hundreds of neon fish. I\\'m a guest in their world, with everything I need right on my body, just like them. The only difference is I have an air tank instead of gills and plastic fins instead of bony ones.45 or 50 minutes later, I\\'m back on the boat. The sea feels calmer, just like my stomach. The ride home is always better. I\\'m less nauseated. I feel much more relaxed, knowing the hard part is over. Immediately, the fish discussions start up: \\'Hey, did you see that scorpionfish?\\' \\'Oh no, missed that! But how about the angelfish?\\' I get so wrapped up in those, I don\\'t even think about the waves. Seasickness only lasts an hour or so, and I\\'ll endure that any day if it means diving. After 5 years of diving, scuba has become a kind of therapy for me. It brings me to a place that I never could go without dropping into that hidden place. As Jacques Cousteau said, \\'From birth, man carries the weight of gravity on his shoulders\\\\u2026 But man has only to sink beneath the surface and he is free.\\' I find that I not only escape the weight of gravity, but also many others: those of auditions, track meets, papers, and more. Diving brings a removal from almost all the problems back home. They can\\'t break the surface. Soon I\\'m back home though, and I need to manage there. Sometimes, it doesn\\'t work. Sometimes, the pain wins and I can\\'t get away. Still, I continue hoping that I\\'ll win the next round. I\\'ll push through the research for knowledge, through the workouts for strength, or through the practicing to get the solo. Even still, I\\'ll push on, because I know that every time I get that taste of Bonine, something good is only a few steps away. \"}, {\"index\": 939, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what lessons did you learn?\\'Narcissus, ReimaginedTraditionally, failure sets the foundation for success. I reject this tradition. For me, the process is amended: earlier achievement sets the foundation for my failure, which in turn paves the road for far more meaningful success later. After doing well at Congressional Debate nationals the summer before my junior year, I was ecstatic. I felt like a great warrior battling through the debates. As I accepted my award, I was sure that great honor radiated from my angelic blue eyes. I was a god\\\\u2014a debate god.  That\\'s why I was surprised the next fall when few people cared about my accomplishment. I was especially stupefied by the indifference of one group\\\\u2014the Congressional Debate novices. Each year, several freshmen join our squad. By the end of that junior year, four of the five novices had quit the team. Now, in retrospect, I know that I was partially to blame. While I admit it would be hyperbolic to claim that I expected these young debaters to worship me, I definitely expected them to honor my accomplishment. Our first practice epitomized this expectation. The novices walked into the room, and I made sure that my voice was the first they heard. I also just so happened to be discussing the national final with my teammate. Of course the novices were intimidated. How could they ever live up to the seemingly impossible standard that I set? In reality, anyone who puts in the work can have just as much success as I did. But I didn\\'t want the novices to think that. My over-inflated ego wanted them to think that I was the best debater they would ever meet. So, I puffed out my chest, spoke over my coaches, and dominated discussions. And in the process, I perpetuated what I now call the \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018alpha-male culture\\' of Congressional Debate. The novices quit because they felt as if they were expected to win nationals their freshman year. I had not mentioned to them that I could hardly deliver a coherent speech as a freshman. They should have been excited, not scared. I most regret this failure because these four bright individuals will never experience the thrill of debating, nor will they form the closest friendships of their lives. I took that opportunity away from them by behaving in this self-aggrandizing manner. I wish I could tell you that I had an epiphany and magically learned to be a better person. It wasn\\'t that simple. I learned through leadership. As vice president of my school\\'s debate team, I found that the team\\'s interests must come before mine. When planning a strategy to retain more novices, I realized that we had to include them; we had to share our unending excitement for debate and the art of argumentation. The energy truly is contagious. No one\\\\u2014not even me\\\\u2014cares what place I got at a tournament two years ago. I do care about how I got there: through hard work, camaraderie, and education. I realized that if I share my love, not my inflated ego, I would create a community of inclusion and support.   In many ways I am blessed. I had an opportunity to rectify my past mistakes. Just a few months ago, this year\\'s novices stumbled bleary eyed and confused into practice. And this time, I viewed them not as an opportunity for personal gain, but as possible partners in my community. Remembering my earlier egotism, I led the varsity in making honest efforts to befriend the freshmen. When teaching, I grew passionate not because of my success, but because of their potential. I learned that the legacy I leave will not be found in ranks, but in community. \"}, {\"index\": 940, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Standing for the fourth hour on my sore heels, in the midst of a brightly lit operating room, I sweat like I have just run a marathon. Rows of people watch me stare down at the scratched table, and I feel the burning of their eyes on the back of my neck. Here, in blue and white, with my hair tightly tied back, I feel my most complete.The summer before my senior year, I took a month long trip to London without my parents. This journey helped mold me into the person and learner I am today. I stayed with an elderly family friend and had only one hundred and fifty pounds to my name. I ate only breakfast and dinner, washed my clothes in the sink, and truly found out what being financially responsible could mean. More importantly, I was able to feed my curiosity for medicine by exploring one of the greatest cities in the world.I chose a spot each day off a map and walked wherever I fancied. I did whatever looked most interesting, unafraid of exploring a new place with just my own company. I learned that the greatest and cheapest thrills were expanding my knowledge and absorbing the rich English culture. For five pounds, I found myself in the Old Operating Theatre Museum on a blazing day in August. Exploring this facility, which archived surgical tools and procedures from the eighteenth century, was worth every penny. I spent two hours in the two-room museum, unable to tear myself away from the history being offered.I moved from the two-century-old oak surgical slab to the physician\\'s journals and read intently through every page, every detail, every cursive letter. Sunroof lit, the room\\'s warm glow bounced off of the worn tan wooden floorboards that lined this half circular attic inlet. The stair\\'s edges rounded against my soles as I stepped up a center aisle that split centuries-old steps. I was able to envision the crowds of inexperienced medical students restrained by the thin and twisting iron bars as they craned their necks for a better look. I turned into a row and imagined myself on the tips of my toes, excitedly trying to catch the action. For five pounds, my passion for medicine was stoked, and it is a passion that still burns bright.I believe the ability to heal the human body is one of humanity\\'s gifts and one that must be perpetually cultivated. I have striven since the age of eight to be a part of the scientific community and participate in this important work. This has led me to explore every opportunity possible to immerse myself in the study of medicine; including spending hours watching the medical channel, presenting to educators in favor of hands on scientific teaching, and practicing intubations on medical dummies while working with real medical professionals as a part of my Medical Careers class. Through exploring medicine, I have been able to feel all of the exhilaration of being a doctor in training. I have learned that I am ambitious enough to attack problems and also have the ability to lead others in the same direction.One day, like the surgeons represented in laminated pamphlets next to the amputation saws, I will create innovative surgical procedures. I can accomplish this, but first I look forward to learning more about the human body and the opportunities higher education will grant me. In the future, years from now, I plan to be someone who contributes to the medical knowledge base and moves humanity forward. \"}, {\"index\": 941, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Falling in Accidental Love with Physics Sitting in the back of the bus sophomore year, I had my tattered copy of The Bell Jar opened to a dog-eared page and was humming absentmindedly. An idea for a new poem crossed my mind, so I scribbled it in the margin. In the seat in front of me, a few guys were talking about Science Olympiad and turned around to ask if I would be interested in joining the team. It was all I could do to not roll my eyes dramatically at the mere suggestion, so instead I told them, \\'Science isn\\'t really my thing.\\' And it wasn\\'t. It really wasn\\'t. As a self-proclaimed literature nerd who wrote poetry, I was resolutely against the idea of all things scientific or mathematical. I just didn\\'t think that I could ever bring myself to care about numbers or formulas when I could write stanzas or paragraphs instead. However, when it came time to register for junior year classes, I begrudgingly admitted that I needed a science credit and signed up for AP Physics, thinking that I would struggle through it and be disinterested a majority of the time. With this mindset, I walked into the first day of class expecting the same dull disappointment that had accompanied every science class I could remember. But then my teacher started talking about how physics seeks to discover and explain the workings of the universe and how, through learning and applying physics principles, we could come to a deeper understanding of how\\\\u2014and more specifically why\\\\u2014everything from sub-atomic quarks to falling apples to entire galaxies work the way that they do. And as I considered this idea, it struck me that, even if the study of physics consisted of formulas and theorems, it was undoubtedly poetry. At first, I was surprised at myself for even thinking such a thing; it was against my strict hatred of science and all related subjects to do so after all. But as I continued in the class and began to grow more passionate and enthusiastic about the subject matter, I decided to run with this concept of physics as poetry, and I started writing a series of poems that I later entitled \\'The Accidental Physics Love Poems.\\' Each one incorporated a different physics topic (electrostatics, flux, and entropy to be precise) into a more-or-less classic love poem. It started as a solely experimental project because I was uncertain if I could successfully translate the poetry that I saw in physics into actual poems, but as I worked on them, I began to discover that physics and love poetry coincided much better than I initially believed. The thrill of holding hands for the first time related exceptionally well to an electrostatic force, and the instability and inevitable change of budding relationships correlated to the universe\\'s increasing entropy. What had started as merely an experiment to see if I could combine two things that were supposedly mutually exclusive turned into a major realization\\\\u2014I could love both literature and science. There was no law that said I couldn\\'t, even if I had previously felt like there was because I was incapable of seeing how the two could work together. Though unorthodox, I discovered that having a passion for both allowed me to supersede what I would have been capable of if my passion had remained restricted to only the literary side. And though upholding my slightly pretentious anti-science, pro-poetry policy may have originally been the most tempting course of action, doing so would have prevented me from recognizing a significant connection between seemingly opposing fields and from creating something unexpected and interesting in light of this discovery. \"}, {\"index\": 942, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] An Ongoing ConversationThe moments that define us aren\\'t magnificent, once in a lifetime occurrences. They happen everyday, right under our noses; we just usually don\\'t notice. My defining moment occurs at 7pm every night, when my dad calls out, \\'Boys!\\' That\\'s our cue. My brother and I rush down the stairs to set the table. Once the table\\'s set, my family and I convene to eat dinner together. But dinner is far more than just a time to consume a meal. It\\'s a time to talk, a time to catch up. Even after the food is gone, we often find ourselves conversing. Those intimate daily conversations have molded me into the person I am today. The conversations have facilitated my intellectual growth. At school and through my own reading, I often discover topics that interest me. At dinner, I\\'m encouraged to share those interests, explore them further and cultivate my passions. Whether I\\'m bombarding my parents with medical questions, or sharing fascinating facts from my own interests within the worlds of economics, science and mathematics, our conversations enhance my thirst for knowledge. As a result, I\\'ve developed an inquisitive nature that has allowed me to approach anything, eager to learn and discover more.The conversations have also instilled in me the importance of reflection. Dinner invariably starts with the same question., \\'So how was your day?\\' As mundane as the question may seem, I look forward to it everyday. With it, I get to be introspective, contemplate my experiences and learn from them. When something good happens, I get to rejoice and share my success because I know that my family will rejoice with me. When something bad happens, I have the opportunity to discuss what went wrong and why, knowing that I\\'ll be offered unwavering support. I\\'ve tried to apply this introspection to all aspects of my life. Whenever I face a challenge, I pause, ponder the situation and think about what to do next.   Through our conversations, I\\'ve also learned the importance of communication and collaboration in decision-making. Whenever a decision needs to be made, we discuss it with each other. One night, my mum mentioned that she wanted to apply for a job in New York, but she wanted our feedback first. We discussed it, weighed the pros and cons, and together came to the conclusion that she should apply. That night I learned that communication is the key to ensuring that all members of a group are happy. Now, whenever a decision needs to be made in my life, whether it be how to phrase a question in a direct examination for Mock Trial, what stock to choose in Financial Markets Club, or even what college I should apply to, I know to consider all stakeholders\\' opinions, needs and interests.Lastly, the conversations have taught me to enjoy the simple pleasures of life. When we just need a break from the day-to-day stresses, the conversation becomes more light-hearted. Occasionally, I\\'ll put on some music to enhance the ambiance and instead of discussing serious topics we joke around, laughing with cathartic melodies playing in the background. In that moment, I can take a step back and enjoy the gaieties of life and the comfort of home.  The jocular, relaxed conversations have shown me the importance of stress management. I\\'m extremely grateful for the conversations I\\'ve had with my family at dinner. They have guided, inspired and molded me eternally. Of course, one day, not so long from now, the 7pm family dinners are going to be a thing of the past; our conversations reduced to nostalgic memories. But even so, I hope that at college I\\'ll be able to continue the tradition of having a conversation over dinner, so that I, and my future college peers, can benefit and grow from it. \"}, {\"index\": 943, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The ball plummeted to the court, stopped for a passing moment as if to taunt me, then rocketed into the air, narrowly escaping the edge of my racquet. I let out a sigh, pursed my lips, and chalked up another loss to Rory Samuels. By now, one would expect that I would be used to it, this being my fourth straight loss to the guy. Even if it weren\\'t, nobody in his or her sane mind would think I could pull off a win (the magic \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018W\\'). I was a mental time bomb; he was the calmest player to grace the court since Ivan Lendl. I was short and skinny; he was the reincarnation of da Vinci\\'s Vitruvian Man. I would say this was a David v Goliath setup, but from a tennis perspective, I would be a fool to suggest I had him beat in either brains or brawn.I was by no means a bad player \\\\u2013 I would often come through with a few games or even a set on especially lucky days \\\\u2013 but there was perfectly sound reasoning as to why he was the better player: he was sixteen, I was fourteen; he had time, I was loaded with schoolwork; he wanted to become a professional tennis player, I didn\\'t. However, to a child who at age five skipped a grade just to \\'beat the bigger kids\\' and vigorously fought his cousins for hours just for the bigger half of the sandwich, age and time were just silly excuses. There was no way I would look back and say I never beat Rory Samuels. So, for the first time in my life, I developed true discipline. Discipline to hit the weight room at 6:00 AM every morning; discipline to get on the court two hours a day, five days a week; discipline to push myself through grueling hill sprints and suicide runs. Every night, I reflected upon the day\\'s work and made sure that I had beaten Rory in every one of its aspects. And just over three months later, the ball once again plummeted to the court, stopped for a passing moment, and rocketed into the air. Only this time, it narrowly escaped the edge of his racquet. I did it. I got my magic \\\\\\\\\\\\u2018W\\'.Of course, my future will not be decided by the strength of my forehand. Through the past few years, I have come to develop a far more fervent love for biotechnology - the notion that my work can directly lead to cures against devastating diseases and contribute to our basic understanding of life as a whole is, to say the least, irresistibly tantalizing - and I have started on a path to becoming a biotech entrepreneur. Rory is gone now, off to the green hills and palm trees of South Carolina to train with his idol, \\'Ivan the Terrible\\' Lendl himself. But the lessons I learned through the Vitruvian Man, my newfound sense of discipline, will stay with me always. I maintain discipline to give my all each and every time I don my white laboratory coat (no matter how frustrated I am after my twelfth consecutive failed trial or how fatigued I am at midnight after having monitored a reaction for the past four hours); discipline to lead monthly charity projects for pediatric cancer patients at my local Children\\'s Hospital; discipline to work over forty-hour weeks during my vacations in order to learn from established researchers. And every night, I reflect upon the day\\'s work and make sure that I improved in every one of my endeavors. I make sure I beat Rory. \"}, {\"index\": 944, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] In a universe of constellations and magnificent galaxies, a single average star can be easily overlooked. Regardless of how bright the star may shine, it will never be able to elicit the same awe that the other massive astronomical objects might. That is the challenge that I struggled with as a transfer junior to Deerfield Academy, a school full of prodigious musicians, artists, athletes, dancers, singers, and philanthropists. I was that star, not particularly gifted in a specific art; I was just, by my own simple definition, ordinary.  My first weeks at \"}, {\"index\": 945, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The tiny plane shook as the wheels hit the ground. I looked out from my window and marveled at the greenest grass, the bluest sky, and the most sincere smiles. I was finally home in Barquisimeto, Venezuela. I sprinted toward baggage claim, leaving my mother behind to carry our bags, and rushed toward my family; they were always waiting right outside the sliding glass doors. It was a twice-yearly competition between my sister and I: who can reach the family first? As the years passed by, the family grew with new baby cousins that I was eager to play with. It made the dash out those sliding doors a million times faster. As I jumped off the plane, it was no longer about the fresh Venezuelan breeze on my face or admiring the green grass- I just raced to reach my aunt Milagros, whose name means \\'miracles\\' in Spanish. She became my safety blanket whenever I arrived in this miracle-deprived country. As the insecurity rose, the greatest feeling was neither the breeze nor the hugs, but now I only felt safe when we were locked inside the bulletproof car. After one too many gunshot noises I became scared of my home. Graffiti concealed the walls and my mother concealed the insecurity. \\'Don\\'t be afraid. No one will hurt you,\\' she repeated as she calmed my nerves, day after day. One summer I decided not to go. I stayed behind as my mother and sister made the trip that I previously loved back \\'home\\'. That disastrous place was not my home. I never wanted to go back. That summer, I realized that I was missing more than my family. I missed the green grass that I ran around in every summer since 1998. I missed Grandma\\'s kitchen, where we spent countless afternoons making arepas. But most of all, I missed the hospital that I volunteered at and the children that I loved and adored- the children whose faces lit up every time I arrived with bags of toys and clean clothes. There was no community service to pass the time and no smiling children to brighten my days. The next time I returned, I was still afraid. Every noise sounded like a gunshot and everyone became a threat. In two weeks, my love for the country grew within the four walls of our apartment. Grandma\\'s warm hugs and warmer arepas filled mornings with happiness and love. My aunts treated me as their own daughter; my cousins became my best friends.When I finally stepped outside, a vicious cycle took me from loving my home to feeling miserable and unsafe. I thought of all the things that made Venezuela wonderful, and realized that the children and patients were the ones that made me feel safe in this unstable country.Community service removes my fear. It makes me vulnerable and humble, while making me so much stronger. My desire to make a difference is stronger than my own emotions. Working to improve the community has taught me everything I know about strength, perseverance, and humility, and I am forever thankful for the service opportunities I have had. In the coming years, I hope to extend my efforts around the globe, making a difference that can be felt in both the biggest cities and most remote villages. Throughout my studies and experiences, I plan on leaving a mark on this world that is great enough to show how much I adore giving back and the amount of effort that I am willing to put into my service projects.  When I realized how even the insecurity in Venezuela couldn\\'t stop me from working in the community, I realized something else: when I am doing something I love and feel strongly about, I am, and always will be, unstoppable.  \"}, {\"index\": 946, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I haven\\'t listened to the song Stubborn Love by The Lumineers in about a year now. It never made it to the radio, so I\\'ve never turned on my favorite station and heard that song. I haven\\'t played it in just as long, despite the fact that I love the song, the lyrics, and the band. But I\\'m glad I haven\\'t heard it because it reminds me of the few months when I prepared for my mother to never come home from the hospital.My mom had lymphoma and multiple rounds of chemo when I was two years old. I don\\'t remember anything from that time. All I know is that I would go to the hospital and see her with wires sticking out of random places, and that meant nothing to me. I was just too young. Then, fourteen years later, the aftereffects of the chemo hit her lungs. It crippled her to the point where she couldn\\'t sit up without her oxygen tank turned up all the way.I blasted that song because I needed to fill the silence at home. There used to be a routine - when I got home, my mom would ask how my day was and what work I had that night. My sister would wander in later and then my dad would come home from work. Now, I came home and was greeted by nothing. The house felt even bigger now that there was nobody in it - my sister and dad would visit my mom in the hospital almost every day. I never could. It hurt too much. The house was never truly empty, never truly silent, up until now. I didn\\'t like it. It was too quiet. So I would sit in front of the computer, turn Stubborn Love up just loud enough that it wouldn\\'t bother the downstairs neighbors, and sing along. Sometimes for minutes, sometimes for hours. Sometimes I\\'d cry. But I\\'d always turn it on.The lyrics say, \\'It\\'s better to feel pain than nothing at all.\\' That line rings true, except when it\\'s the pain of having a nurse tell your dad to take a brochure on how to deal with the death of a loved one, the pain of seeing my mom\\'s oxygen cut off suddenly after walking around her hospital floor and seeing her crumple to the floor five feet from her bed. That\\'s the pain that would hit as soon as I turned the song off. It debilitated me - everything started slipping while I was the only one home. I wouldn\\'t do homework, then lie to my dad and say I did it to seem like I wasn\\'t breaking down. I sometimes wouldn\\'t eat. At all. I sometimes went to sleep at 5 pm and slept until school the next day.My mom had always been the one to tell me to do my homework and eat and take care of myself. My parents refer to their parenting style as \\'affectionately overbearing\\' - my mom in particular would always be on top of me, telling me to do the next assignment, when to eat, what else I had to do. Suddenly, she wasn\\'t there to tell me how to manage my life. And I wasn\\'t prepared to do that on my own. My grades slipped, I lost weight, and my friendships and relationship got strained because I was bursting at the seams to tell everyone how I\\'d been feeling but I didn\\'t think anybody could relate.Slowly, I started to live again. I did as much work as I needed to. I made myself meals daily. My mom would love to claim that the voice in my head telling me to keep going was hers, but I developed my own. I had to. I repeated the lyrics of the Lumineers every day: \\'Keep your head up, my love.\\' And so I did. \"}, {\"index\": 947, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I was in my family\\'s new doctor\\'s office sitting next to my sister and reading an outdated magazine. My mother was recording my medical history for the hospital when I happened to glance over as she filled out \\'Father\\'s History\\' only to see her check the small box labeled \\'cancer.\\' My first reaction was to tease my mom for her obvious absentmindedness. \\'Mom, why\\'d you check that box? Dad never had cancer.\\' Her odd stare bothered me, and I looked to my twin sister for confirmation. With a puzzled look and her head tilted to the side, she responded, \\'Teddy, yes, he did.\\' I smiled, positive that they were playing a strange practical joke on me. My smile waned slightly after realizing they would never joke about such serious subject matter and then disappeared altogether when I saw the impassive expression on my mother\\'s face. My obvious reaction was to ask a barrage of questions. My mother explained: my father had been diagnosed with colon cancer seven years earlier when my sister and I were in kindergarten. Luckily, the doctors had caught it early and were able to cure him after only a few months of chemo. Upon hearing this, the truth of my mother\\'s explanation resonated with me; it sparked fuzzy memories of several family trips to a sterile, white waiting room where I happily and obliviously played games with my sister.After I was able to register the reality of what my mother had said, the first emotion I felt was anger. I felt as if my whole family had conspired against me to guard this huge secret for over seven years. However, after deeper contemplation, I realized the disturbing truth - I had forgotten my father had had cancer. The truth had never been intentionally kept from me. At the time, my mother must have given both my twin sister and I a basic understanding of the situation and, after my father went into remission, my parents chose not to mention the subject to their elementary-aged-children again. After several years, I had simply forgotten what must have been one of the biggest struggles of my father\\'s life. This conclusion brought waves of guilt and shame over me. For years, I had remained completely ignorant towards one of the most significant events of my father\\'s life. Since then, he must have had at least half a dozen screenings and tests that I had totally failed to notice. The constant threat of remission must have taken a great emotional toll on him. How could I have missed these signs? How could I have simply forgotten that my dad used to be a cancer patient?Reflecting on my father\\'s character, I realized the answer: My father had purposefully created an environment that would allow me to forget. He stoically ensured that his own crisis had as little effect on his family as possible. This selflessness is the reason he gets off work early every week to take me to academic team, the reason he suffers through every single one of my four hour violin recitals, and the reason he moved to Detroit alone for a year to work and support our family.The day I rediscovered that my father had cancer changed the way I view myself and my father. Through this experience, I was able to gain a better understanding of who he is and how he has influenced me. I also developed a greater appreciation for the countless sacrifices and hardships he has endured that allow me to enjoy the life I live. My father\\'s stoic personality and sacrificing nature have shaped my own sense of responsibility and allowed me to develop a level maturity that I could not have attained without his example. His support motivates me to strive for excellence, and has certainly shaped my identity. \"}, {\"index\": 948, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.\\' - Paul Coelho, The AlchemistShe\\'s a foot shorter than everyone else and not athletically built. Nobody special, really.One summer, she wanted to qualify for the state championship swim meet. She had nine seconds to drop in the 200 breaststroke. \\'How can I make the state cut?\\' she asked her coach.\\'You have to train at least four hours a day. You can\\'t be the last person to finish in practice. You have to keep up with everyone else,\\' her coach responded. \\'Why don\\'t you set small goals at a time? Maybe drop two seconds this summer?\\'She didn\\'t want to set a small goal. Disregarding everyone else\\'s comments, she attended two practices every day. With swim practices at 6 AM, evening practices at 4 PM, and midday naps to rejuvenate, she had no time to herself. She had just one goal: drop those nine seconds. With the hours of practice, her body fat toned down. She challenged herself, shuddering at the thought of missing the cut.The day of the qualifying meet came, making her as anxious as ever. She dove into the water and completed the first two laps of breaststroke, gaining momentum with every pull. On the third lap, however, the pain shot through her body, like an inferno swallowing every single inch of her muscle. She felt like she was going to die.But she took another breath, completed another stroke, pulled, kicked, and inched her way forward through the water. She was too scared of missing the qualifying cut. With each motion, more tears flooded her goggles in disgusting saltwater. Only one more lap left, she thought. She pushed her body to finish -- to the point where her pain receptors stopped working. She jammed her fingers into the touchpad and collapsed on the wall: she was done.Everything after that was a blur.

However, during all of this chaos, the only thought racing through her head was, please, tell me that I made my state championship time; I don\\'t want to fail\\\\u2026Her heart dropped when she saw her time. She had missed the cut by 0.2 seconds. 0.2 seconds. Disappointed, she turned to her coach. \\'Stop dwelling on your times. Don\\'t be afraid of \\'failing.\\' Instead, focus on giving your best effort in practice,\\' he advised.I will beat her at the district championship swim meet this year. I train more than her, lift heavier weights than her, swim faster than her in practice, and eat healthier than her. It\\'s not easy, but I do it anyways. She fears the outcome; I don\\'t. She\\'s afraid of what she can\\'t control; I\\'m not. I lead my lane at swim practice, swimming faster than boys six feet tall. I will beat her because I know how she trains; I know all her weaknesses.She is the old me. \"}, {\"index\": 949, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Every Thursday night at the Recreation center, my second set of sisters meet to catch up on the previous week\\'s events, letting the words flow safely from our lips without filter; this is our Girl Scouts meeting. Considering we\\'ve been friends since an early age, I feel comfortable no matter what with this group of girls. Whether it\\'s been a week since we\\'ve seen each other or a few months, I know I am able to confide in them with whatever ups or downs life has provided me. For about two hours a week, I\\'m taken away from the stress of school work and all my worries disappear, being able to simply partake in a laugh with some of my closest friends. Not many young girls continue scouting throughout their entire adolescence, thinking that it\\'s a childish organization, but few have experienced meaningful friendships as I have. No matter where life takes me, I know I can count on my Girl Scout family to be there alongside of me. Girl Scouts has been my safe haven since I can remember and I couldn\\'t imagine life without it.I started Girl Scouts at the earliest age possible which was bumblebees, the group that previously existed for girls under seven, and have continued for the past fourteen years of my life until presently. Since I am now the oldest age a Girl Scout can be as an Ambassador, my friends and I have stepped up in our troop and became models for the younger girls, taking away from our own work in order to aid our new troop leader who only has one other assistant for about forty young girls. Watching thesechildren who have learned to confide in me grow up and mature is one of the best experiences somebody could go through, even if by the end of the night my ears are ready to fall off due to the constant chatter.Knowing that I won\\'t be around all of these people after I graduate high school is a frightening thought, although I know I can trust without a doubt that they\\'ll be there for me within a heartbeat if I need it. It\\'s very important for girls who are going through the beginning years of their long life to be able to have a support group like Girl Scouts and know what being a true friend is about. Despite the trite opinions of girl scouting, it truly is a great organization to grow up with. Empowering women to be theirselves while also being kind to others is a great concept to live by and should be taken more earnestly, for it is more than just selling delicious cookies. \"}, {\"index\": 950, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] If the 500-yard freestyle didn\\'t have counters, I would still be swimming. (Actually, that happened once and I ended up swimming a 550.) When I compete in the 500, I\\'m not thinking about the race. I don\\'t think about my speed, and I don\\'t think about the people swimming on either side of me. The moment I dive into the water, none of that matters. I set my pace, my overworked brain shuts down, and my subconscious takes over.Above the water, everything is hectic. Life rushes by, everyone scurrying around with places to be and dozens of things to do. It seems like there\\'s no time to enjoy solitude; even when alone, I frequently find myself glued to an LCD screen. Underwater, all of that is blocked off and my abovewater life pauses. People are still hastily doing what they \\'need\\' to, but for six blissful minutes their worries don\\'t bother me. For six blissful minutes, I\\'m alone, free from all outside stress and distractions.The water instantly maneuvers its way under my cap and into my ears, blocking all sound from reaching my eardrums. My nose is completely barred from detecting scent, and my mouth automatically expunges the water it catches on each breath, not tasting the heavy chlorine. My body is attuned to the steady rhythm of the strokes and my fingers naturally enter the water at an easy angle. My eyes are open, but I don\\'t see. When I choose to, I can look to the side and see my coach and teammates yelling, but I can\\'t hear them; it\\'s almost like I\\'m the protagonist of an action movie, having just been shocked by some explosion, and I\\'m floating outside of my body for a brief moment. In this case, my being doesn\\'t return to my body. I float in a pool of ethereal liquid, and my mind assumes the spotlight. My body takes care of itself, so I have time to appreciate the spiritual solitude.Each time is different. The most common thing for my mind to do in this situation is compute. I split the 500 into 20 25-yard laps, and calculate the fractions and percentages of the race I\\'ve completed, and the amount I have left. As I swim, I keep a mental progress bar telling me that I\\'ve done 13 out of 20 laps, which equates to 65%, meaning I only have a third of the race left.Other times, I remember a programming project I\\'ve been having difficulty solving. I see the situation in my head. Rather than setting up an outline, actively planning what I\\'ll do and in what order, my thoughts flow freely. I can solve the problem without realizing which common algorithms I\\'m using or the significance of what I do; everything just fits together.When my mental tracker hits 80%, my thoughts are forced back to finishing the race. Maybe focusing only on the race would improve my time, but win or lose, I finish the race physically exhausted and mentally refreshed. \"}, {\"index\": 951, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] My nuclear family consists of my mother, my father, and my brother. While all of them have an impact on me, I have to say that my mother has the greatest impact of all. She is strong-minded and independent. She does not care about the opinions of others when it comes to what people think or say about her. She is also very giving and would provide me with everything I could ever ask for if that was possible, and it was my mother who taught me to toughen up and not let other people\\'s opinions affect me and make me feel lesser.My father has the second greatest impact on me. My dad has spoiled me and treated me like a princess. While many people would think this is a bad thing, it actually gave me the high standards that I hold today. I learned that I should work for the best and never settle for anything less than that. This lesson can be applied to several aspects of my life, including my personal life to my grades in school and extra-curricular activities I participate in. One thing I appreciate about his encouragement is his push for me to work towards A\\'s in all of my school classes, which helps me strive to get the best grades I can get.My brother has helped shape my goals through his proactive lifestyle. He currently attends University of Arizona to pursue something he has a passion for, becoming a special needs administrator. When he was in high school, he was always well rounded. My brother maintained a B grade point average, excelled in basketball throughout his entire high school tenure, and he was known by many as a social butterfly. Even though there were days I felt like I was living in his shadow, there was a certain level of pride I had being his younger sister. In the end, it made me want to become my own person with my own goals and aspirations, but most importantly build my own identity. His success throughout high school motivated me to stay focused and get involved.With all three individuals influencing me, my family makes me want to be independent, strong-minded, self-respecting and goal-oriented. My family supports me and encourages me to do well in school and strive for success in all that I do in my life. My family has shaped my dreams and aspirations because as a child, they helped guide me in what I want to do with my future. Growing up, I would spend quality time watching television shows with my mother. These shows include but aren\\'t limited to: CSI, Law and Order, and Criminal Minds. While watching these shows, I would see the actors act out these various jobs that consisted of a lot of focus, emotional stability, and skill. I soon knew that I wanted to take part in one of them with my final decision being forensic pathology. I let my mom know that I wanted to take forensic pathology up as a career and she was ecstatic, mainly because she didn\\'t get her chance to do something similar as she wanted. My mother is the one who is pushing me to make sure I have everything I need to make my dreams come true.My brother has shaped my dreams and aspirations because he wants to see me be a step ahead of where he was and is in his life. He noticed that I had established my goals earlier than he had, and just like my mother, he wanted to make sure I reached those goals. My father has shaped my dreams and aspirations, as well, because he showed me that I should set goals for myself and come up with a plan on how I was going to reach that goal. He wants to see me do big things in my life.My dream is continue to do well in school and to finish high school off strong. I want to become a forensic pathologist, which will require more schooling and therefore, hard work and dedication. My family has helped me decide on that dream unconsciously and will help me stay persistent as I reach for it. \"}, {\"index\": 952, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I\\'m packed between the sweat of five hundred people whom I do not know, wearing their alcohol breath as perfume.

But here, I am content.I used to kneel at the feet of my emotions. They consumed all logic and common sense. There was always a constant restlessness, an anxiety that sometimes made me fidget and other times made me stop sleeping. My mind would wander from the apparent growing interest in an artificial womb to my inevitable death to what unconscious sexual issues Freud would say I was struggling with. My emotions made sure I didn\\'t know what contentment felt like.But here it\\'s different. At The Shelter, I am a human. I\\'m a part of an exhibit. A gallery. A whole collection of the same 26 chromosomes whose neurons look like the structure of the universe. We\\'re beautiful. Dave Grohl saw that beauty when he said, \\'You can sing a song to 85,000 people and they\\'ll sing it right back for 85,000 different reasons.\\' This is what peace is: a room of complete strangers singing the same song together.There is nothing separating us.

When I\\'m at The Shelter I can celebrate the very essence of being human.This goes beyond my love of music. Being at The Shelter taught me that I don\\'t have to be agitated all the time.

And if I don\\'t know anything, maybe I can\\'t believe anything, either.\\' And so begins my journey into the unknown. I am sitting on a cracked wooden bench beside my friend with my face in my hands. Despite my inner turmoil, I feel the warmth of the sun on my shoulders and hear people laughing and chattering as they change classes at my residential high school. All my life, I have seen the world through the eyes of one who believed wholeheartedly in a personal God, proven completely by the existence of an incontestable objective morality. But over the course of this year, belief gradually ceased making sense, and I am now forced to admit that I don\\'t have the answers I thought I grasped so firmly.I have always clung to certainty, a fact that is apparent in so many different aspects of my life, especially in my love for logic and mathematics. I have always been attracted to math and consider its study something I\\'d be happy doing for the rest of my life, but as I questioned the faith that had so long been my guide through life, I turned to the certainty that mathematics offered as a way to convince myself that the answers I wanted so desperately did indeed exist. My junior year, I immersed myself in math courses and competitions as I never had before--Calculus I, Discrete Mathematics, an independent study in non-Euclidian geometry, and Mu Alpha Theta, even proving myself willing to do math for thirty-six hours straight when I participated in the High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling. I discovered the beyond-words amazingness that is Euler\\'s identity, the satisfaction of a theorem well proved, and the clever applications of differential calculus. But I also discovered the open-ended problems--does P=NP? Was the four-color theorem ever incontestably proven?--and considered the impact of Godel\\'s incompleteness theorem on what we can ever truly prove, coming to realize that even mathematics doesn\\'t provide me with utter certainty. I am left fumbling in the dark, trying to find my way through a life that I see as more and more devoid of meaning. Only one question remains: that of how to keep on living it.In my search, I turn to absurdism. In The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus describes how the famous Greek man doomed to the eternal task of pushing his boulder up a hill, only to see it roll down again, is in fact a hero--he accepts with open eyes his futile, everlasting task and yet refuses to give up, and so must we act throughout our lives if we wish to confront the truth and yet avoid madness. I take comfort in the idea that one can realize that life is objectively meaningless and yet still live as if there is meaning, all without any cognitive dissonance. I choose to give significance to my life: I find it in sitting on the same cracked bench with my best friend under less troubled circumstances and appreciating human connection, in pursuing my education by leaving my small Mississippi town to attend the best high school in the state, and in the breathtaking beauty of mathematics and logic. I may have a Sisyphean task, but I embrace my role, and I love my boulder. \"}, {\"index\": 954, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I couldn\\'t get the words out. Confound this speech! I practiced so tirelessly, and here it was, dancing around on the tip of my tongue, refusing to make the vital transition into audible sound. I paused for what felt like an eternity, locked into a statuesque torture of mortification as I struggled to recall my next line. As it came to me, I regained my composure, and carried on with an outward expression that disguised my inner panic. I finished with a smile, shook the hand of my judge, and walked out of the room with as much poise as I could muster. The moment the door was shut, I fell into my teammate\\'s arms and gave way to the flood of tears crashing against my eyelids.This was my first experience with an Academic Decathlon tournament.My Academic Decathlon team has been the regional champion for twenty-four out of the past twenty-six years in one of the most competitive regions in the state, all under the same head coach. In all those years, working with twenty-six different teams, my coach has worked with exactly three sophomores, myself included. Three out of possibly 234 total decathletes. The last team to feature sophomore members was in 2005, a notable year for two reasons: 1) it was fresh off its first state championship ever and 2) it failed to win the regional championship.Because of the history of the team, the so-called \\'sophomore curse,\\' I resolved to work harder than I had ever worked before to compensate for the perceived weakness of my age.We started work in April of 2012. Our first full tournament, which was to include not only seven objective tests but also speech, interview, and essay, was to take place in December. We met every day in class; school for two hours a day. We met from 9 AM to 3 PM every Saturday. As a team, we felt prepared. As an individual, I did not.In December, I stood in front of my speech judge and, midway through my speech (ironically, a speech that honored the beauty of language and speaking), I forgot what to say. I paused. In my own eyes, I had botched my speech, botched the whole event, blemished the reputation of the Team. That night, I apologized to my team and coaches for my failure. I couldn\\'t stop crying.The next day, I was awarded the silver medal in speech with a near-perfect score and a note from my judge complimenting me on my poise and good recovery from a minor mistake. I was the individual overall champion in my division. I\\'ve never heard the phrase \\'I told you so\\' so many times in one day.But all the medals and accolades in the world couldn\\'t have convinced me that I hadn\\'t failed. I knew that I had failed because I knew that I could do better. I hadn\\'t lived up to the standard of excellence that I set for myself. Though others were proud of me, those others do not set my standard for success. Only I can give myself permission to do my best, and to feel like I have done my best. Though this sometimes leads to disappointment, unless I set the bar ever-higher for myself, what will I have to reach for?My time in Academic Decathlon has taught me to never stop striving for excellence, even in the face of failure. And my \\'failure\\' at speech my sophomore year has taught me that, when I shoot for perfection, I have the chance to get all the more closer to it. \"}, {\"index\": 955, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Thirty-seven very mathematically inclined high-school students and a dozen professors stand in a long hallway on the third floor of a building devoted to the physical and natural sciences. They wear white t-shirts, all of which bear the stenciled likeness of a yellow pig. Now they begin to sing in almost-unison about axiomatic set theory to the tune of \\'Californication\\' by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Mathematical talent, unfortunately, does not directly translate into vocal aptitude, and so collectively they cover the range of around eight different keys. As they complete the ceremonial Yellow Pig carols, they feast on a cake which is, to no one\\'s surprise, in the full three-dimensional shape of a yellow pig, lemon-yellow icing and all. The students should be weary, three-hour problem sets just behind them, but instead there is only cheering and excitement: this is a day of celebration. Yellow Pig Day, the 17th of July. I am among them, and I am perfectly content. Now, I promise I am not in a cult (or if I am, it is a relatively harmless one). Nevertheless, this may seem a bit strange. You would be completely justified in asking questions such as \\'Why are math students singing about yellow pigs?\\' and \\'Why is it fun?\\' but I can assure you they have no answer. Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics (HCSSiM) is the oldest high-school mathematics program in the country, and with that come some very esoteric traditions. That did not stop HCSSiM from being the greatest time of my life.* I can\\'t imagine there was a single student who wasn\\'t excited by what we had learned on any given day \\\\u2013 I remember countless nights spent breaking curfew in other students\\' rooms, just to keep working on a problem set. At the breakfast table, on dormitory couches, during the annual 4-mile mountain hike \\\\u2013 intellectual enthusiasm was not something reserved for certain times or places. It pervaded every inch of the space we lived in, and I loved that.** I began to recognize what it actually means to be in a collaborative environment. One of my fondest memories will always be the set of statements affectionately named for me: \\'Connor Conjectures.\\' A Connor Conjecture is a mathematical hypothesis which is interesting, thought-provoking, and expands upon the current base of knowledge in a significant way \\\\u2013 but is completely incorrect. As you may guess, this particular subset of conjectures was named when the class collectively realized that, however plausible my hypotheses seemed, they maintained a remarkable propensity for being wrong. Before my experiences at HCSSiM, I don\\'t think it had ever really occurred to me how little it matters to be right. There I learned that the ideas are what matter; it is fine to be wrong, as long as your ideas still contribute and help the learning process.  It was a quirky, bizarre, brilliant culture, and it was wonderful.***This clich\\\\u00e9 was an intentional artistic choice.**Yes, the parallelism in these endings was also an intentional artistic choice. \"}, {\"index\": 956, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Swim practice was a better exercise in mental math than school ever was. By the time I was nine, I knew how to calculate times up to the millisecond in my head\\\\u2014because milliseconds mattered. During a swim set, my head would be full of numbers: if my average time per lap is 15.52 seconds, then a 100-yard free would be 1:00.08, and after factoring out fatigue that\\'d be a race time of 59.68, which would be 0.18 too slow for my goal of 59.50, which I could hopefully whittle down to 54.50 in another three years. My thoughts would pause during the flip turn, then continue racing forward as I\\'d start another lap.After races, I\\'d always know how I did before I ever looked at the scoreboard. I\\'d know that I\\'d gotten a best time by two seconds because my dive was a hair faster than in warm-up, my push-offs a touch faster off each wall, my arm reaching forward and meeting the touchpad a finger-length earlier than expected. But there was a time when improvement wasn\\'t enough\\\\u2014dropped times were simply stepping stones to the ultimate goal which, for me, my coach, and my parents, was Olympic Trials. They were sure of my future and I followed, because we all believed the path of my life was concrete. At that point my world was definable solely by age and times; I checked the chart of 13-14 age group Eastern Zones qualifying times more often than I checked Facebook. And I never failed to deliver. Every goal in the spreadsheet my dad had created for me was crossed out, and I fed off of praise from teammates and coaches. Every day, I\\'d open my eyes to an 8-by-11 piece of paper taped above my bed where I\\'d scrawled, \\'No pain, no gain,\\' my mother\\'s favorite adage in her stories of my parents\\' immigration to America. I chanted the phrase in my head for months during practice, as I ignored a persistent throbbing in my ankle. Three diagnostic tests and an MRI scan later, we discovered I had both tendinitis and a torn tendon. The doctor told me that I\\'d need three to five weeks of rest before getting back into the water. By the last day of the third week, my dad was sure my ankle was okay and drove me to practice. The doctor protested, so we got a new doctor.Everything was okay, for the first three months\\\\u2014then my progress stuttered and then it stopped completely. I wasn\\'t even going to make it to States, and I had always made it to States with no trouble at all. The times for Zones that my coach had outlined in last year\\'s Christmas card were no longer attainable. Swimming became a constant struggle between me and a weight on my chest that reminded me that without swimming there was nothing. My carefully constructed spreadsheet of goals became a mangled series of edited numbers highlighted in red. But numbers simply exist\\\\u2014a manmade method of measurement\\\\u2014while life pushes on, whether I wanted to admit it or not. At that point, I had never done another extracurricular activity before; afterwards, I began exploring academics and art and other places, both literal and metaphorical, that were outside my comfort zone. I found new niches, new knowledge, and perspectives I wouldn\\'t have known had existed, had I not begun looking for them. I still love swimming, but after my future in it faltered the world fell out of existence. However, I hadn\\'t realized that another had always been there. The more I stopped living four years ahead, the more I started acknowledging what was right in front of me\\\\u2014because the future had never existed in the first place, no matter how clear it had looked in my dreams.

I took one last look at my note card. This time, I didn\\'t read it. This time, I ripped it in half. A leap of faith, this decision terrified me. I now see it as the pivotal moment in defining my character.Up until then, I obeyed this societal notion of sacrificing genuine thoughts for perfection. Being polished meant safety because it let me fit in. I was the student who limited my analysis to what the teacher believed correct or the type of friend who changed their personality to impress others. This was a false sense of being well-liked. In this need to edit myself, in order to become what others thought I should be, I allowed my personality and voice to disappear amongst a crowd. Life was going on, but without me.I was told weeks in advance that I would give a speech, serving as a junior leader, to my church\\'s yearly sophomore retreat. My supervisor went over and edited everything I would be saying. I would then read to the youth what was on paper: basic dogma. That seemed easy enough. Yet, this note card requested words spoken by a person, not words speaking through a person-a person with opinions, faith, honesty, and a way to put it all together. I was this person: a public speaker. I could not let myself be artificial. I took the risk of potentially humiliating myself by exposing my testimony on the chance that it would inspire the group that would rather be elsewhere. On that bold night, when I ripped the paper and stepped up to the microphone, the air was thick and the room was still.Inspiration struck-words became situations, thoughts, and ideas. my testimony became the story of someone who once lived for himself, who spent the night on that retreat the previous year finding beauty in peace and faith, who found caring relationships and a life committed to the people surrounding him, who recently had his faith put to a test in the adversity of a nearly fatal car accident and overcame the distress by spirituality and devotion. It was a representation of my growth, and the potential for all to grow.Aesthetically, it was not a graceful presentation. There were stumbles, pauses, and silence. Yet, as I reached my last line, out of the blinding stage lights, the audience slowly emerged into a standing ovation. The few exposed moments of silence were overcome with applause, encouragement, and hugs. My honesty inspired my peers more than that note card ever could have. At this moment, I knew that my bold choice had been the right one. With the impacts it had on others and the impacts on my leadership style, I would never wish to go back and do it any differently.Conforming to sets of expectations gives order to society and creates a comfort zone; it lessens potential failure. Yet, I choose to live my life exposing who I am, even in an age when everyone quickly judges decisions outside of acceptable schemas. The silence that I thought was filled with judgments no longer silences me. I now welcome this silence with the opportunity to speak again.Against the criticism or mistakes, I am a dynamic force and put my character into everything I participate in. I speak for who I am amongst a silent crowd, in the hopes of impacting them enough to live as I am- out loud.Rather than searching for societal approval, I have approved of myself- without any edits. With the first word spoken into the microphone, the silence was broken. My real voice was finally heard. To my surprise, people were eager to listen. \"}, {\"index\": 959, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'Between the Pages\\'My eyes dart back and forth as I sit curled up on the sofa, settling upon the worn pile of cushions. The house is silent, save for the hum of the air-conditioning and my faint breathing as I thumb through a novel, the pages swishing crisply as I work my way through them. However, it\\'s anything but peaceful. As I reach the end of a line, folding back the corner of a page, I don\\'t turn it just yet. I hold it there for a moment, the suspense rising within me. My brain begins to churn away as possibilities take shape, like thousands of lines going off on a tangent. I soak in the rich imagery and figurative language, sifting through words for clues and hidden meanings like a treasure hunter mining for gold. I need to know what will happen next in the story, but I also need time to ponder, to develop my own suspicions and guesses as I go along. Eventually, a faint smile reaches my lips. I\\'ve figured it out the ending and I am no longer at war with myself between these pages. Within a thirty second window, I\\'ve crossed that invisible threshold between the mindset of a reader to that of a writer. And the more I read and explore, the easier it becomes to break through this barrier.I didn\\'t choose literature- it chose me, kidnapping me in the middle of the night and holding me hostage from sleep. I wear my thickened glasses as a badge of honor, proof of those secret affairs in the darkness, reading my latest novel with a flashlight under the covers. Those who know me know that I am never without a book in hand. And those who ask me what I am reading are immediately sorry, eyebrows raising in surprise as I gush excitedly about characters, plot and theme. \\'I just wanted a summary,\\' one person said warily. \\'Not an analysis of allusion in The Fault in Our Stars.\\' My mouth fell open. \\'But it\\'s such a big part of the book,\\' I insisted.\\' It has Shakespeare references. Shakespeare.\\'Judging by her subsequent groan of despair, she didn\\'t share my enthusiasm.However, I don\\'t get discouraged. From writing poems and fanfiction, to reading fantasy and horror, I continue to stride on to the beat of my own literary drum. I\\'ve even gotten my parents involved, imploring them to go on literary adventures with me. \\'Mom, can we go see F. Scott Fitzgerald\\'s grave?\\' I asked recently. She blinked at me in bewilderment. \\'For what?\\' she said. I patiently explained to her that this literary genius who produced The Great Gatsby was buried just a mere fifteen minutes from our house and how, as an aspiring writer, I was obligated to make the pilgrimage. I could not miss the opportunity to feel connected to a legendary writer who shared my zeal for words.To some, my passion may seem strange, but I keep on with this madness, this constant search of literary gems, to find the deep significance of this life, displayed artfully on white pages. My mind, a spliced paradox of art and science, becomes whole whenever I hold a book or a pencil, allowing the side of me that loves Imagine Dragons and Anime cartoons to meld with the other half that enjoys logic and inquiry. We all have a story within us, along with an urge to be noticed, and to be heard. But for me, literature offers a unique escape, a chance to disappear and revel in the calm within the eye of the storm. It offers clarity of the mind.And so I sit there, on that sofa, quietly reading in my own nirvana. \"}, {\"index\": 960, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] How Literature Saved my LifePerhaps the greatest blessing my parents have ever granted me was the move from our apartment in the Bronx to a two-family home in Queens, two blocks away from a public library. The library had all the boons my young heart could desire: bounties of books, air conditioning in the summer, and sweet solace from a dwelling teeming with the cries of an infant sister, a concept I couldn\\'t yet fathom.Books, then, were entertainment. They provided a state of contentment that filled my young life with the vicarious experiences of a novel. As I grew older and my wondrous paperbacks were slowly replaced with textbooks of concentrated factfactfact, the role of books became a means of distraction for the instances when my life was lacking in flavor. I could enrich my life with the mere flick of a finger \\\\u2013 an advantage I savored.With the tumultuous changes that came with the transition into high school came a different relationship between literature and I. School become onerous \\\\u2013 incredibly onerous, and my motivation began to dwindle. My family, whom I looked to for support, was causing more problems than it fixed. My closest friends seemed to vanish as soon as I sought them out for help. Feeling as though I had no one to turn to, I became depressed. For the first time in a generally serendipitous life, I felt stuck in an insidious place that would sabotage the future I had been working so hard to materialize.Disappointed in my friends and family, I sought out God. Since I had grown up faithless, I ineffectually spoke to religious club leaders at school and attended mass at the local church for months, prompted to find some being that could understand what I then believed to be a suffering so unprecedented and extensive, no one but an almighty being could relieve it. I was on the verge of defeat when literature saved me.It wasn\\'t the stories, as it was in my childhood, but the great minds behind them, that startled me into salvation during my recent years of high school. Presented with a plethora of erudite minds in my English classes\\' curricula, I was able to discover the truths I desperately needed but hadn\\'t had the courage to seek out. These authors wove, with a magical quality suggestive of the God I had failed to find, tales engorged with the emotion I had believed was incomprehensible by anyone but myself. From the ways fictional characters dealt with their anguish, I drew solutions I could apply to my own life.I gathered from William Faulkner\\'s The Sound and the Fury the ways in which I could identify love within a home seemingly devoid of it. Sherwood Anderson\\'s Winesburg, Ohio taught me how to recognize beauty in things that had become grotesque - including myself. William Shakespeare\\'s whimsical plays opened me to the possibility of frivolity as a means of yielding insights, as opposed to the cynical approach to the world I had been fostering.Literature has given me a novel perspective on life. It teaches me that the things that afflict me are the things that make me human, that they have been felt before, and that they will eventually give way to exhilarating parts of life that are worth the struggles. Literature instills me with bright prospects for the road ahead, armed with the knowledge of some of the most prodigious minds to have lived. The solution to my distress that I had been after had always been with me, like a God, waiting, two blocks away. \"}, {\"index\": 961, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] As a student who has always wanted to challenge himself, I enrolled in AP Human Geography in ninth grade\\\\u2014my first AP class. I had never needed to study or truly apply myself before high school, and I had the belief that I could have success in high school and achieve my goals without any extracurricular effort. When the first test was given, I had not studied; instead, I had spent the night before watching football\\\\u2014better known here as soccer. I failed it miserably. My grade was in the fifties. Since I had never seen a grade below ninety, I told my teacher there was a mistake. He told me, however, that the only mistakes were in my answers. When he uttered that, a fire began to blaze inside of me\\\\u2014I was determined to do well. I immediately began to apply myself in all of my classes, and the results were extraordinary: first overall in my class and a 100.8 academic average. My determination and work ethic allowed me to succeed in a rigorous setting\\\\u2014something I had never been in until high school.Failing my first test in high school set me on a path to where I am today. Now, not a day goes by where I am not doing everything within my capability to do well in my classes and extracurricular activities. It taught me that everything valuable\\\\u2014a high grade, a state championship, a record time\\\\u2014comes at a cost. Striving for excellence in all that I do has led me to possess an unbreakable work ethic. I know that no high school career is completely smooth. It does have a few speed bumps in a mostly smooth road. However, those speed bumps have not discouraged me from striving for an education in America, something my parents have dreamed of for me. If the results are not good enough, the solution is simple: work harder. One can never be discouraged by one failure. One failure does not discourage me; it encourages me to succeed even more\\\\u2014just like my first AP Human Geography test. Success is my only option; complete failure is not. \"}, {\"index\": 962, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I have grown up in the world of performing arts- a world of communicating emotions and conveying messages. From a young age I have been immersed in the innovative environments of theatre and dance, from performing in musicals at our local playhouse to participating in my ballet company\\'s production of The Nutcracker. Through these various endeavors I have learned much about myself, but it was not until recently that I learned, through dance, something about the world in which I live. Dance has been many things for me over the years, but the most important role this art form has played in my life is that of a vehicle which delivered me into adulthood.This last year, I was cast in a piece called \\'In and Out of Weeks\\' which was about the five stages of grief. Of the six dancers chosen to participate in this project, I was by far the youngest at the age of just sixteen, so I was determined to prove that I could perform as genuinely and affectively as the older girls with whom I was dancing; due to the nature of this piece, however, this turned out to be very difficult. As a sixteen-year-old from a a privileged community I had never really lost anything of much importance, so I was being asked to convey emotions that I had never before experienced. My specific role in this piece was to express through my movement the third stage of grief, which is incalculable anger, and I set about discovering this foreign emotion by examining the losses and tragedies that people close to me have experienced. As I thought about what it would be like to lose a sibling or have an adulterous husband, I began to realize that such dreadful occurrences are reality for so many people, and this realization in itself gave me a taste of grief. \\'Why is this world so cruel?\\' I would ask as I went through rehearsals, analyzing the grief that people feel on a daily basis and determining how to translate and express such an emotion through my own body.This piece was one that we were taking to a dance festival out of state, so the week before we left for our performance we gave a community showing of our work. It was in this performance that it all came together for me. As I danced that night I cried, and my fellow cast-members cried, and, before we had even reached the bows, the entire audience was in a mess of tears. Let me tell you, it is such a surreal experience to be in a room where everyone is feeling the same overwhelmingly raw emotion and everyone is weeping because of a deeper, very human understanding that is being shared. I was invited into the world of adulthood that night, and I closed the door on my childhood innocence as I shared with others the stabbing sensation of grief that is inevitable to be experienced at some point in the life of every human being. As the room wept together I made my first realization as the woman that I had just become in my community: in the end we are all on level ground; we are all people, and we will all feel the same emotions. And my most important discovery was conveyed in the last position my cast took in the end of the piece with our backs turned to the audience and our arms woven around each other, holding one another upright: it is together that we can mend and find a new beginning.In this way I danced into adulthood in my community by coming to a new understanding of what it is to be human and learning to sympathize with others in such vulnerable emotions as pain and grief. \"}, {\"index\": 963, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The bucket pulls on my arms, biting into the reddening gooseflesh of my hands. The hard plastic of the handle judders and shakes as I weave my way through the throngs of people, my voice hoarse and raspy from my repeated impeachments for charity. Mind numbing fast, I call simply for aid. I ask those around me for donations, not for myself, but for those whose voices have long since drowned in the cacophonous tumult of an unmoving city. I ask for the homeless of Dublin. Heads dip and eyes seek the solace of the cold December pavement, which is preferable, I suppose, to whatever guilt or compassion I might instil in them to delve into their pockets for the bevelled edges of loose change. As such, they continue walking, my calls ricocheting on apparently deaf ears, hitting the ground with a dull thud.An air of desperation grabs hold of me as a black shadow descends upon the cobbled streets of the fashionable old quarter, which has left no room for compassion, only the last-minute rush of Christmas shopping. A clinking of metal alerts me to the handful of coins rattling through my slot, and indeed to the individual who offered them up. Swivelling with new found vigour and blossoming delight, I immediately express my gratitude to him. He simply smiles and nods, acknowledging my thanks, and walks on into the dusk. He is poorer by a few coins, certainly, but richer in his knowledge of his impact on: the homeless of Dublin, those humbled by an austere and impassive world, and those who no longer possess the strength to raise their heads and ask for help. Or at least that is my hope, it\\'s hard to be certain.The evening descends upon us, and the indecisive showers finally settle on a constant drizzle. Almost unconsciously the other collectors and I flock together, forming a decidedly penetrable blockade across the street, adding our voices to the low drone of day\\'s end. Meandering in tactics between the harsh insistence of a Dublin street-vendor to the forced nonchalance of a seemingly respectful collector, we bring in what money we can, always fearful of its inadequacy. A guttural growl escapes from my stomach, alerting me to its discontent at remaining empty. It grumbles and groans. Let it. There is only perhaps one more day of fasting and sleeping rough beneath the marble columns of the General Post Office. Only in truth a handful of days sleeping out on a pavement settee and collecting, endeavouring to take on and publicise something that the homeless face every day, before we retreat into the finery of festive Christmas celebrations. Presents and stuffed poultry, party hats and ridiculous one-liners, Christmas pudding and clotted cream, we are not the ones forced to carry on living on the streets. Home is a word which still has meaning to us.As the dense flow of people thins to an unsteady trickle and eventually dries up entirely, we drift back towards the main group, where the dawn concert is about to begin. The street performers begin to play, giving their time and voices up to the midnight air, filling it with the joyous rhythm of an acoustic guitar and the gruff baritone of our accompanying collector\\'s choir. Not much is made from this midnight set. However, like everything else that we seek to do , it adds to the collective, impacting on a monetary and a spiritual level. The total sum collected would rise to 6 digits, but the most important part, was the changing effect it had on any who surveyed us, inspiring them to be involved in the community around them. Or at least that is my hope; it\\'s hard to be certain. \"}, {\"index\": 964, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] The Long Beach Public Library, which has been like a second home to me, is the one place where I am perfectly content. And when I say second home, I mean it- I essentially grew up there.By the time I was 5 months old, my mom had introduced me to all of the resources the library had to offer- not just books, but magazines, videos, and a variety of educational programs. This early exposure to the library has not only assisted me academically, but created a \\'home away from home\\'; a safe haven where I feel completely comfortable. Over the past seventeen years, I have made more memories there than I can count. These include making my first friends, losing a tooth, learning how to whistle, trying my first Starbucks Frappuccino, and making my first attempts at SAT prep. While most of these don\\'t remotely resemble \\'traditional\\' library activities, they are all important aspects of my childhood.When I was a toddler, I spent most of my days crawling through the stacks, not able to keep my hands off of anything. Although my mom attempted to keep me in the children\\'s section with board books and foam blocks, I essentially felt as if I had unlimited access to the entire second floor. Being such a loyal patron, within the first few years of my life just about every librarian, clerk, and administrator knew me by name. They still do. Initially, I assumed it was natural to be on a first name basis with everyone in the library, and thought nothing of it. It wasn\\'t until my first kindergarten field trip to the library that I realized it wasn\\'t as common as I had previously thought. The amazed stares of my classmates as I confidently led the pack, personally greeted by the ladies behind the towering front desk, made me question whether this was typical of kids my age. I was especially surprised to find out that some of my classmates weren\\'t able to find the biography or nonfiction sections- wasn\\'t that just common knowledge?To this day I can still navigate the stacks with my eyes closed- which makes my job a whole lot easier. I began working as a page at the library on my 15th birthday, and I could not imagine having a better job. I get to spend hours surrounded by the same books I\\'ve been poring over since I could first read at the age of 3 (Matilda would be jealous.) I am one of the first to handle all of the new books that come in, which is one of the perks of working in the library. Another benefit of working here (which came as a surprise to me) is the human interaction. I am normally a shy and reserved person, and holding conversations with strangers never came easy. But for some reason, my timidness disappears when I am at the library. I have had several interesting conversations with adults and children alike who share my love of reading. One of my proudest moments was helping a child who \\'could not survive another night without a book!\\' find books that we were both sure he\\'d love. Spending time in an environment that means so much to me has helped me break through my shell and use my knowledge to help and encourage young children to maintain a healthy love of books.My years of volunteering and working in such a wonderful place have also given me the opportunity to learn the inner workings of the library that I had never known before. Having full access to the entire library, and spending even more time there (if that\\'s even possible) has given me an even greater feeling of comfort. I cannot think of a place, besides my home, more meaningful to me, or where I am more at ease than my public library. \"}, {\"index\": 965, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Although born in the USA, I grew up and was educated in Mexico.  I returned to the United States in August, 2012.  In Mexico, I was a top student at a competitive school.  I was a confident person.  When I first arrived, everything seemed good. Nevertheless, once my English teacher assigned a book to read, my confidence vanished. I did not realized the magnitude of my ignorance until the day I sat in front of my desk and discovered that every sentence of the book had two or three words unknown to me. As days passed, dozens of words would add to the already immense list. I turned to my mom for help, but I only found emptiness. I was alone. My determination started to wear off, my confidence began to dwindle. Will I learn the vocabulary fast enough? Will I go to college? Will I pass my classes? Questions tormented my broken courage. I looked at the mirror and I did not recognize myself. Three months after my arrival, I went to see my high school counselor.  I was concerned because my report card said I was in 9th grade, when in Mexico I was in 10th grade, and some of the courses I was taking then were ones I had already taken in Mexico.  I asked my counselor when I was going to graduate. He told me not to worry about it, but I was worried because graduating in four years was not in my plan.  When I insisted, he said, \\'You are probably going to graduate in four years. I want you to have the necessary bases.\\'  I disagreed. I told him I wanted to change my classes and graduate in two years or three years maximum.  Contemptuously, he told me that depended on me. His doubt and contempt for my abilities made me determined to show the world what I was capable of. At first I tried to motivate myself by thinking about my past life, but I realized that was gone; I needed new, solid foundations based on myself, and I knew that the only way to create them was through my own actions. I redoubled my efforts to learn English. I checked out books from the library. I attended no-credit classes at the local community college. I studied hard.  The long lists that once were a source of terror became my best friends; they made me believe in myself again. I arose from the ashes of my despair with renewed courage and confidence. I learned English, although it took a year of constant work, which left little free time for anything else. I changed my courses to ones that challenged me.  I moved my graduation date to June 2015.  I accomplished what I set out to do. And in doing so, I became even stronger that the old Jessica had been. She relied on other people, but I, I had learned to rely on myself to overcome any obstacle.  \"}, {\"index\": 966, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Imagine you are running around a ropes course facility, pool noodle in hand, surrounded by your entire high school junior class during a sorry excuse for a team-building game of tag. This simple childhood game sounds fun and innocent on the surface; however, I have seen past the lie. I know the true meaning of tag--utter disaster. Although it may be hard for one to really see such a game as evil, I have unexpectedly obtained sure-fire proof of its dangers. I am all too familiar with the failure of tag and especially the weeks of rebuilding that follow it.Reimagine the scenario of pool noodle tag with a new detail about my experience with it. While trying to enjoy the supposedly safe game, I fell and tore my ACL, MCL, and meniscus. For whatever reason, I was condemned to that failure without any real way to blame myself for it. The simplicity of the accident causes me to actually laugh sometimes. For the first month after the incident, no one actually believed that one could destroy his knee by playing with a pool noodle. The weeks that followed this accident taught me one of life\\'s most important lessons: the failures of our lives for which we cannot expect nor take responsibility for build the most character. Humility is a hard trait to come by; not very many people humble themselves by choice. Pride controls the human mind in many aspects and requires a strong force to usurp its position for the good of humility. Recognizing personal failure and striving to fix it is one thing. Realizing your own personal downfalls is no doubt very humble. The trouble that I had after my accident is the same problem that most people experience today. Without someone to blame for accidents, people turn to their pride for reconciliation, when in actuality, that pride brings even more problems.Generally, when the average person considers the failures of his life, he is often prone to thinking of ways to prevent more problems. Most people know the classic idea of transforming weaknesses into strengths. However, failure cannot be categorized solely upon personal cause and effect; humanity may not always be the cause for humanity\\'s failures. Accidents are, at the core, failures attributed to unforeseen circumstances, not poorly planned decisions. The biggest problem for humanity today is its often hypocritical approach to failure. The current generation does not acknowledge that rebuilding from unforeseen failures can often strengthen a person much greater than any other event could. My awakening to this revelation was through awkward and completely undeserved failure. I could no longer turn to my known problems, hoping I would find some equation to fix my weaknesses. All that was available to me was failure, and I was left with the ultimate problem of not knowing what to do with it. A week stuck in bed taught me a lot, though. I embraced the defeat I was left with, and to my very surprise, I no longer felt destroyed. The situation taught me something I could have never learned through arrogance: Humility cannot be bought. Only through tough, inexplicable experiences can anyone ever truly learn what it means to be humble.Shouldering the weight of problems with no discernible cause can transform a person. Failure exposes weakness. Weaknesses can change into strengths. However, the failure that shows no weakness and no cause leads to the greatest strength. Tearing down and rebuilding yourself shows potential, but the building of character after you have been destroyed by unforeseeable fate defines true improvement. \"}, {\"index\": 967, \"new_personal_statement\": \"\"}, {\"index\": 968, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  As I gaze off into the dripping heat, I think about the newest book I bought from the local peddler. A novel by a new woman author, named Mary Shelley. It is about Galvanism, and my tutor would pitch a fit if he knew. The Savannah heat is so unbearable that I am fairly certain I might faint in my new gown and bonnet and cause a terrible scene. But just when I think I am about to lose my mind, I see a horse and carriage turn around the corner under the Spanish moss, and I know it is time for tea.I have been given the gift of time travel. I journey though the centuries in a museum in the heart of Savannah, Georgia\\'s charming historic district. There I am no longer Kate Bosen, high school senior, avid Motown fan, and cupcake connoisseur, but a young woman living in the nineteenth century Deep South named Louisiana. I am enchanted by science fiction and transcendentalist novels, and am frequently reprimanded for my interests in such. I began to volunteer my time there when I was fifteen, as a docent-in-training and, after an intense winter of studying, started giving tours of the historic landmark to visitors from all over the world.  I was thrilled to learn about the museum\\'s nineteenth century roots. I had always thought Savannah\\'s history to be fascinating, but never had a chance to research or immerse myself into it. Through the museum, I had the time of my life meeting tourists coming from all over, from Argentina to Zimbabwe, and learning how to capture a crowd and keep them hanging on every word.Eventually my enthusiasm was recognized and I was asked to join one of the museum\\'s \\'living history\\' programs, in which the whole staff strip themselves of their nametags and daytime personas and emerge from their offices donning the most hip and trendy fashions of the South\\'s Regency era. My colleagues become my fellow actresses, and bosses become my good friends that gather to joke over tea and gossip about the latest presidential scandals and the balls. Our motley crew includes other museum\\'s tour guides, Savannah\\'s high society ladies, and even local military personnel. The cast of these shows is the most diverse and accepting group of people I have ever been fortuitous enough to encounter, and they have taken me under their wing. The amount of love and support I receive from them has allowed me to develop poise and confidence, and this is something I hope for everyone to experience, even if it can\\'t be from a bunch of misfit Jane Austen-esque history buffs clad in bonnets and neckties.The shows that I am a part of at the museum have become the best parts of my week. After long days of lectures and seminars that leave me feeling drained and distraught, I leave school in the twenty-first century and travel through time back into 1820. Surprisingly, this journey only takes about ten minutes or so, depending on the traffic in the space-time continuum. When I arrive, I pull on my lace gloves, settle my curls in my bonnet, and always remember to appreciate my real life because of the terribly uncomfortable corset that Louisiana has to wear. But becoming good ol\\' Lou and teaching others about her life has helped me understand my own better, and thank my lucky stars every day that I have a place to escape reality completely. Some people can feel great in a park, or maybe a quaint little coffee shop, but I am only truly at peace when I can remove myself from the current day and age all together and journey back to the nineteenth century.  \"}, {\"index\": 969, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] As an eager freshman, I enrolled in the most challenging AP class offered to upcoming sophomores, which happened to be AP World History. My ignorance of world history was immense; thus, the class was ultimately eye-opening.Soon after class began, I realized I needed to comprehend each world religion in order to be successful in the class. As I arduously worked, I was astonished at how little I knew about my own religion. Being the child of divorced parents with shared custody, Sunday church services were not a luxury of mine. Yet, I never questioned my assumed devotion to Christianity. If I were asked in what denomination I believed, I could not have answered.Embarrassed and confused, I blamed my parents for failing to teach me the concept of religion with an open mindset. I felt as though precious gems were withheld from me and I was given a rock. My embarrassment and lack of exposure sparked a major interest in religion.In my quest to find enlightenment, I found that every religion is a keyhole into another culture. By understanding different religions\\' origins and meanings, I could see foreign cultures from a new perspective-- it all made sense! Of course Chinese people value education so immensely, Confucianism encourages an extensive education and has greatly influenced Chinese culture. I also started to comprehend the reasoning behind people of differing religions, and how religion is such a unifying, and dissenting, force. If I were a Jewish Israeli, I would feel cheated and defensive over my homeland, due to how the Palestinians treated me, as well.As I gained a more sufficient background on world religions, I felt confident about forming my own ideologies. I did not agree with each religion\\'s values, but I learned that each religion is valuable to someone. Once I started to investigate Southern Baptism, my findings were rather interesting. My family\\'s personal concepts had a legalistic tone, one that revolved around the people\\'s need for salvation from themselves. I understood why some may think this way, but I was definitely not in agreement.Suddenly, I understood why my parents forced me into Southern Baptist Christianity; they believed so greatly in their Southern Baptist values that they assumed it would be best to preach these ideals to me. My disagreement and comprehension of my family\\'s beliefs allowed me to respect why I was only taught one religion during my childhood. The decision to restrict my religious education was more of a tradition than a spiteful action.Being proselytized into a sole religion was not the real issue at hand, although it seemed to be the focal point in the beginning. My irritation came from the fact that I was never challenged to think about my own religion. I knew I was capable of making my own decisions, even those of religion, and I was determined to do so. One aspect I did not realize at the time was the difficulty of such a task. The challenges I have faced pertaining to religious preference continue to this day. My quest to understand such sophisticated concepts as religion is still in its first few stages, and I will continue on this life long journey in search of well rounded education. Despite the fact that I may never answer all of my questions, I will never regret the decision to challenge my religious beliefs. No one ever wishes to be put behind closed doors once they have seen the beauty of the world. \"}, {\"index\": 970, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I was allowed to quit school when I was ten.At the end of the school year, my teacher accused me of kicking a ball into another teacher, assuming that my friend, with his disarming smile, would never do such a thing. Disappointed by the lack of universal justice, I sulked back home and told my parents I wanted to quit school. They said it was up to me. I didn\\'t have to go to school; I wouldn\\'t have to go to college if I wouldn\\'t want to. My life was mine to craft. Ultimately, I chose to remain in school after I became fascinated with history the following year, and began enjoying education and seeing its value. The personal liberty I was afforded enabled me to understand why I made certain decisions, and whether there was a genuine purpose to my actions.The control I had over my life and education gave me the freedom to experiment and discover whether I was satisfied with my role and impact in society. In tenth grade, I decided to go to Nepal to see if volunteering would be fulfilling, so I helped organize an excursion there. Reflecting on the experience of spending a week teaching kids everything from math to acting in the Himalayas, I became aware that I was extremely restricted by the Nepalese organization I worked in, and felt that the impact I could make was limited. I wondered whether teaching kids English during that time made a sufficient, lasting difference for them, and that bothered me. It was then that it struck me just how constrained I was and how little a difference I was making. I realized that I wanted to effect lasting, qualitative changes in society by using my resources and freedom of action to better the lives of others. This year, I am organizing a new, longer and better-prepared excursion to the country in hopes that others will be able to discover something about themselves just as I have.Seeking change and living in an expression-constricting society, I saw how important it was for me to help others experience the independence that my parents had offered me.

What do you do or experience there, and why is it meaningful to you? 644 words out of 650 Gettysburg, a small town in the middle of Pennsylvania, was the sight of the largest, bloodiest battle in the Civil War.  Something about these hallowed grounds draws me back every year for a three day camping trip with my family over Labor Day weekend.  Every year, once school starts, I count the days until I take that three and half hour drive from Pittsburgh to Gettysburg.  Each year, we leave after school ends on Friday and arrive in Gettysburg with just enough daylight to pitch the tents and cook up a quick dinner on the campfire.  As more of the extended family arrives, we circle around the campfire and find out what is new with everyone.  The following morning, everyone is up by nine and helping to make breakfast which is our best meal of the day while camping.  Breakfast will fuel us for the day as we hike the vast battlefields.  My Uncle Mark, my twin brother, Andrew, and I like to take charge of the family tour since we have the most passion and knowledge about the battle.  I have learned so much from the stories Mark tells us while walking on the tours.  Through my own research during these last couple of trips, I did some of the explaining about the events that occurred during the battle 150 years ago.  My fondest experience during one trip was when we decided to go off of the main path to find a carving in a rock from a soldier during the battle.  Mark had read about the carving in one of his books about Gettysburg, and we were determined to locate it.  After almost an hour of scanning rocks in the area, we finally found it with just enough daylight to read what it said.  After a long day of exploring the battlefield, we went back to the campsite for some \\'civil war\\' stew.  There is nothing special about the stew, just meat, vegetables and gravy, but for whatever reason, it is some of the best stew I have ever eaten.  For the rest of the night, we enjoy the company of our extended family.  My cousins, my brother and I listen to the stories from Mark and his friends experiences\\' in the military.  After the parents have gone to bed, we stay up talking with each other, inching closer and closer to the fire as it gets colder.  Finally, we creep back into our tents, trying to be as quiet as possible to not wake our parents.  The next morning we awake red-eyed from the lack of sleep and cook up another fantastic breakfast.  Unfortunately, after breakfast we have to pack up and head back to Pittsburgh.  It will be another year until I visit Gettysburg again.   There is something about that time I spend in Gettysburg that keeps me coming back to visit.  For one, it is just a fun, relaxing time I get to spend with my family.  This trip also fulfills my love for the outdoors.  From sitting by the campfire and falling asleep to the chirp of the crickets, that is my definition of a perfect weekend.  Gettysburg is also an interesting place to go for Civil War buffs like me.   While walking down the Union line or walking Pickett\\'s Charge, I imagine how the battle would have been played out around me.  Every year when I visit Gettysburg, I learn more facts and stories about the battle, soldiers and generally about the Civil War.  While I am in Gettysburg, I am perfectly content, passionate about the history and just enjoying the great outdoors with my family.  This drive to learn goes beyond just my passion for history but applies to all of the math, science and business classes I have taken and clubs I am involved in at school.  Every day, I am genuinely excited to learn.  \"}, {\"index\": 972, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Many students insist that friendships or passions ultimately shape who they are. For me, it was the life that I was brought into. I was born into a family that had preexistent issues of drug and alcohol abuse. Prior to my birth, my mother experienced a time of sobriety, but after she met my father she relapsed. For the greater half of my young life, my older siblings blamed me for causing my mom to spiral back into a life of drugs. It would be suffice to say that as an infant I was unaware of what was going on, but as I grew into my elementary school age, the lack of love, attention, and support from my family started to make me feel unwanted. However, one six-lettered word would change my life forever: school.At school, all my personal problems seemed nonexistent. The love and support I lacked from my family, I received from teachers who admired how smart I was and how much I loved school. The lack of confidence I had in myself was, and still today, restored with my excellent grades, high GPA, and admiration by other students who grovel over my victorious academic successes. Unfortunately, school could not permanently erase all my problems at home. I still had to face going home to siblings who could care less about me and a mother who would often disappear for days at time. When I was eleven, life as I knew it took a turn for the worst. My mother was in the hospital on the brink of death because of an overdose. As I sat watching her motionless body, hopeless and afraid, it was in that moment that I knew I wanted to be a doctor. I knew I never wanted another child to have to go through seeing their parent on the edge of death or a wife at the side of her husband\\'s deathbed. I wanted to help. From that day on, my whole attitude changed towards school. It went from getting straight A\\'s just for the sake of applause to achieving academic success in hopes to pave the road towards a passionate career that would allow me to help others.To this day, others ask me why I take six AP classes. They ask me how I manage straight A\\'s while playing basketball and volleyball and being president of four clubs. Curiosity fills their brains as to why I spend two weekends every month to feed homeless people instead of partying with my fellow seniors, or why I am constantly hanging up fliers for canned food drives. My response to all these questions is that when colleges sit down and examine my profile and academic history and read my essays, they understand my background and are exposed to a driven student who desires to be extraordinary and make a difference in this world. Most importantly, I want them to see a young man who has the ability, strength, and desire to overcome every obstacle put in his way and day-by-day, and be better than the person he was yesterday. \"}, {\"index\": 973, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] It\\'s conceivable that my second grade teacher thought I was a cannibal. Not necessarily due to a habit of gnawing on my classmates\\' limbs, but because, to my feeble second grade mind, there was no difference between, \\'It\\'s time to eat, Mom,\\' and \\'It\\'s time to eat Mom.\\'My teacher, Mrs. Wolf, was similar in appearance to an aggravated Bride of Chucky. She had a perfect upside-down U for a mouth and smelled like a combination of cigarettes, Chanel No. 5, and cherry cough drops. Sheer terror of this woman prohibited me from any form of confrontation regarding my lack of comprehension of the English language. Unfortunately, this meant I had to write a full composition notebook\\'s page worth of material without any actual understanding of speling, grammars, or punctuation;The first of a plethora of issues was my inability to spell. It is very possible that the only word spelled correctly on the assignment was my last name (I hadn\\'t developed a nickname yet so I was still trying to write out the full ten letters of my legal name\\\\u2014quite poorly, I might add).But I was thrilled to gush about this chapter book that I had read over the summer. Naturally, I began to delve into the absolutely fascinating tale of the gnomatic tribe that used bonearrows to hunt buphalows.Such was my 8-year-old literary epiphany. I had just discovered that some combinations of letters made different sounds altogether, and that letters could indeed be sneaky enough to be silent. I applied this logic to everything.Next was the issue of proper punctuation. The previous year, when we had to read out loud in class, we were all taught to take a breath at the end of a sentence. I made the assumption that this little trick went both ways. So, whenever I took pen in hand, I was supposed to read it out loud as I.   Wrote it and when I ran out of breath, I had to put a period there to mark the spot for the.   People reading the sentence so that they would know that they were allowed to breathe at that point in the.   Story.This logic also made it really fun to write extremely lengthy sentences because, if I waited an excessively long time to put a period in, there was the potential that whoever had the pleasure of reading my prose would have to wait an absurd amount of time to pause for a breath, increasing the chance of having someone faint in school.That was the dream.Unfortunately that dream was never realized because the \\'take a breath\\' grammar mentality wasn\\'t one to which Mrs. Wolf subscribed. She mercilessly marked up my page with angry slashes and inserted commentary questioning my mental stability.Mrs. Wolf\\'s incendiary mark-ups became my personal Everest, exhorting me to sublime heights of elementary grammatical achievement. I could have submitted a paper comprised of youthfully earnest three-word sentences, meriting the much-coveted smiley face sticker. But, like a sherpa, I was drawn to loftier summits\\\\u2013\\\\u2013despite grades that occasionally left me with altitude sickness. The trek has been spectacular. Yes there have been setbacks; some forgivable (e.g., third-grade phonetic spelling of \\'sure\\' pronounced by my Texan teacher as \\'shooure\\'), and others less so (e.g., attributing \\'Be the change you want to see in the world\\' to Eleanor Roosevelt rather than Mahatma Gandhi). A decade later, the occasional adolescent literary bungle no longer grates\\\\u2013\\\\u2013it merely reminds me to take a breath, even if I\\'m in the middle of a sentence. \"}, {\"index\": 974, \"new_personal_statement\": \"]  Most children worry about advancing to another level of math: moving from addition to multiplication, from single digits to double digits, from numbers to letters. They worry about advancing in reading: moving from picture books to chapter books, from reading level to reading level. My biggest worry, was that I would accidentally give my sister an excess dosage of her medication and she would consequently die, or that I wouldn\\'t give her enough medication and she would have a seizure. At the age of ten, I had already learned how to wash the dishes, cook a meal, and bathe my sisters. By the age of 13, I carried on a weight many adults have never had to endure. By the age of 15, I felt what true hopelessness was as I watched my sister\\'s illness control her life. After a persistent fever left my sister nearly in her death bed at the age of three, she was diagnosed with epilepsy by the doctors in the Dominican Republic. Unlike my mother who was concerned with my sister\\'s well-being, I was a one-year old who was more concerned with stealing my sister\\'s toys; but my mother\\'s solution was simple: because the Dominican Republic lacked the medical resources my sister needed, we moved to the U.S. with hopes that my sister would be cured of this horrid illness and we could live normally, without any hindrances. Now, 15 years later, there has yet to be a cure for epilepsy. For years, I have watched my mother work endless shifts to pay for my sister\\'s medical bills. I have dealt with tantrums that have left me fearing for my life. One day, my sister nearly set the house on fire and couldn\\'t remember having done so. That was when I realized what true hopelessness was, what it feels like to see someone you love losing control and not be able to do anything about it. This summer, I participated in a Fellowship under the NYU Medical School. Along with conducting research culminating in a high-level research paper, we were given the opportunity to participate in preceptorships where we shadowed healthcare professionals in various departments. While the MRI technicians, Cancer Researchers, and Orthopedic Surgeons were interesting, nothing intrigued me more than the Horticulture Therapists. Until that moment, I had never heard of such a profession or its effectiveness. During my rotation, I got to participate in a special program for children. Our objective was to help children that had lost motor function in their dominant hand, learn to use their non-dominant hands, so that they could perform mundane tasks on their own. This was all too familiar. Because the kids lost motor function due to cerebral impediments and were all under age five, frustration was inevitable in the sessions. After participating in this life changing experience, I\\'ve never felt more accomplished. Being able to help children gain function and become more independent gave me hope that one day my sister would be, if not cured, at least able to live life to the fullest capacity. While I was once angry about the hand my sister, and ultimately my family, was dealt, I learned to convert that anger into passion. Passion to find a cure for a disease that has hindered the lives of many. Passion to help make a difference in people\\'s lives, even if it is just one person at a time. Finally, through college, passion to uncover the interminable scientific revelations included in my life. This passion is fueled by my sister, who convinces me that no matter how difficult things get, there\\'s always a brighter tomorrow. My experiences, and my sister, give me hope that whatever lies ahead of me, won\\'t stop me from reaching my aspirations and will only help fuel the drive I have to change the world, one patient at a time. \"}, {\"index\": 975, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Describe a place or environment where you are perfectly content. What do you do or experience there, and why is it meaningful to you?   When it came time to plan my approach to the college essay, I knew exactly where to go. It had recently rained on the Kosh Trail, and the sweet, airy smell of the damp earth reminded me of past summers as I began the woodland trek around my school\\'s campus. Considering my best options for the essay, I suddenly stopped walking as a lightbulb appeared above my head: what if I were to write about my present location? My mouth slowly widened into a sly smile as the pieces of the prompt came together- how wonderfully ironic that I would unknowingly visit my most sacred place of creative refuge... in order to brainstorm about that very place! Without any further ado, I began composing an outline in my head, my bouncing footsteps beating a clear path through the wilderness.The Paul Koshewa Trail, named for the legendary Cross Country coach and veteran, winds in a neat, four-kilometer loop through the largely undisturbed forest on the periphery of the school\\'s campus. My insulated haven, worn by the shoes of thousands of cross country runners, winds upand down the steep gradients of the surrounding woods. Since I discovered the course as a runner in middle school, I have enjoyed observing the varieties of brightly colored trillium wildflowers poking out from the dirt-covered ground. I take delight in distinguishing the vivid green hues as they dominate the visual spectrum, emerging from the lowly shrubs and ivy to the tips of the tallest pine trees. Here, I can appreciate the small details of nature: the music of high-pitched birdsong and rustling branches, the sweet aroma of honeysuckles emanating from each direction. All of these sensations combine in my mind to form a symphony of survival and natural existence that resonates from all around.Because of the trail\\'s idyllic, isolating nature, just walking along its rocky path allows me to tune out all of the world\\'s chaotic noise and focus logically on whatever occupies my mind. I once struggled with the issue of scheduling my band\\'s set list for a school event. But after losing myself among the thick oaks, I emerged confidently with a decision. Regardless of the situation, new ideas, opinions, and angles always seem to surface from the backdrop of the tranquil outdoors.In order to consolidate my ideas into unique, coherent points of view, I have frequently taken to the trail with a myriad of thoughts and an open mind. Over the years, I have expanded my intellectual consciousness to include a multitude of high profile national and world issues, including the question of American intervention in Iraq and the current crisis in Ukraine. In addition, I have especially cultivated a passion for understanding stories regarding intelligence and cryptography, as my desire to understand how domestic and military secrets are kept and cracked continues to grow in this age of cybersecurity. I closely follow and commit myself to understanding the consequences of the Edward Snowden leak, as well as its implications on the American intelligence system. As I walk alongside the unhurried stream, ideas and considerations come together, forming firm opinions and beliefs. Visits to the Kosh Trail are valuable tools in organizing my thoughts and opinions.The trail has played many roles in my experience along its terrestrial trace: a shaded circuit, an insulating Eden, a sanctuary for the powers of thought. It represents a place to release, to discover, and to grow. Even more so for me, Kosh signifies a figurative platform upon which to exercise reason, and in doing so, develop the components that define me. \"}, {\"index\": 976, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I define my transition into adulthood by an experience I had during the second semester of my freshman year of high school. My father, a professor at a local college, was given the opportunity to teach in its semester-long study abroad program in Florence, Italy. Having grown up in a small Kansas town, the prospect of walking the streets of Florence with the likes of Leonardo and Dante seemed exciting, but also slightly intimidating. I had no idea what to expect and felt a little uneasy about finishing my freshman year away from home. This attitude of hesitation in the face of such a unique opportunity perhaps best demonstrates my childlike identity before the trip. I lacked the maturity to realize that exposure to other cultures and settings could be life-changing. I arrived back in Kansas City six months later as a young adult, brimming with stories to tell and profoundly changed by the experience. One episode in particular represents how I was shaped during the semester.After setting up in Florence, my family and I routinely went on weekend outings. One such excursion was a Saturday trip to Bologna, a vibrant university city filled with a rich history and dynamic citizens: a perfect non-tourist, tourist destination. Our first stop was the 800 year old Basilica of San Domenico. I recall sitting before the shrine of St. Dominic, worked on by the young Michelangelo, and being moved by the cultural weight of my surroundings. The adage, &quot;You are not in Kansas anymore,&quot; was never truer. Before that moment, history was just another subject in school that I read about in books, but at that instant it became a living reality and the world seemed a little larger; this was a small but notable step in my coming of age.After taking in several museums, we chose to spend the remainder of our evening in the historic town square to watch a public screening of Charlie Chaplin\\'s cinema masterpiece, The Circus, with live orchestral accompaniment. Eating pizza under the stars with a crowd of lively Italians, all eyes transfixed upon the screen, helped convey to me a simple understanding of what all human beings share. I had never watched a movie in this manner before - there were people running around and literally yelling at the screen - but we all participated in the joy of experiencing the film together; I was genuinely enriched by this event, and it emphasized to me the importance of cross-cultural exchange. We have much to learn from the Italians, for in general, we lack these types of bonding experiences in our own communities. With the movie over and festivities wrapping up in the city center, we were ready to return home. Italy has many virtues, but municipal organization is not one of them. This began to dawn on me after several hours of waiting at the empty station. As it turns out, the train had been cancelled, and we were stranded until morning. For me, railroads will forever bring to mind a park bench that I called home for an evening.As a whole, I view my experience in Bologna as a microcosm of how my entire perspective changed and improved. Throughout my journey, I saw humanity expressed in entirely new ways. With this I came to realize that the &quot;American&quot; way of life is not the only way and that my tendency to pass judgment on unfamiliar approaches was misguided. As I became more open to cultural differences, I discovered new ways of doing things that were exciting and valuable. I developed a maturity that comes with realizing that there is a reason others do things differently. Like a fine wine left on the racks for decades to mature, my Italian life poured out an exhilarating array of cultural flavors and experiences that molded me into who I am today. I am still inebriated. \"}, {\"index\": 977, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] \\'And here comes Barbaro! The undefeated Barbaro comes up on the outside and takes the lead as the field turns for home in the Kentucky Derby! Barbaro turns it on, and his stablemate Showing Up is second... they\\'re coming to the finish, and it is all Barbaro, with a sublime performance! He runs away from them all, and he has saved something left for the Preakness! Barbaro wins by seven!\\'Instantly, Barbaro galloped over the Churchill Downs dirt and into the hearts of millions, including mine. I, all of nine years old, had just met my very first love.Two weeks later, all hope was gone. Barbaro suffered a severely broken leg, the kind of injury that few horses survive. But they brought him to Penn Vet\\'s New Bolton Center hospital anyway, where against long odds he fought through a long surgery and survived. Tragically, a few months later, he was diagnosed with laminitis, a mystery disease that kills nearly every horse it infects.I remember how everything went numb when I heard the news that Barbaro died. As the years passed, I thought of him often and hoped someday to find a way to honor his memory. Thankfully, an opportunity finally presented itself at the beginning of my sophomore year when I was accepted to my school\\'s selective science research program.Although most students in the program need time to choose a research topic, I hit the ground running and immediately immersed myself in the laminitis-related literature published in the Journal of Equine Veterinary Science and in an Equine Emergencies book I found online. Over the next three months, I filled four notebooks, wrote a 40-page report, and made detailed presentations to my peers and teachers about what I had learned and how I planned to act on my newfound knowledge.With the ultimate goal of submitting a paper to the Intel Science Talent Search, I needed to network in order to find a professional mentor. As a result of my research, I had identified all the major scientists in this field, and I eventually connected through email with Dr. Nora Grenager, a veterinarian from Virginia. She quickly realized my passion for the topic and invited me to present my research ideas in poster form at the 2013 International Laminitis Conference.During the fall of my junior year I travelled to Palm Beach, Florida and presented my research poster. Many of the scientists whose work I had studied expressed surprise that a high school student had developed so much passion for laminitis research and asked me how I had become so interested in laminitis. I responded with the story of Barbaro.At this conference, I was able to speak with many scientists about their work and explore opportunities to define my own research. I was absolutely thrilled when Dr. Jim Orsini, the head of the conference, invited me to come work with him the following summer at the New Bolton Center. While at New Bolton, I helped research the histopathology of hooves and further recorded and clarified how acute laminitis onset occurs by examining measurements of the laminar tissue within affected horses. I immersed myself in the disease, learning as much as possible. Since then, I have continued to work with the New Bolton team to chronicle the changes in hooves that lead to laminitis development. I believe we have filled in major gaps in the qualitative understanding of the disease and hope that my future efforts will allow me not only to make a difference in memory of Barbaro, but also to help many horses like him. If I can help horses overcome a disease like laminitis, it will mean that I have made a difference somewhere and accomplished something meaningful.  \"}, {\"index\": 978, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] I was caught in a rainstorm of glass. The sunroof above had been punctured by something black and round. Lights bled out onto the highway. The freeway stretched beneath and above other roads, forming capillaries and arteries with vehicles as vessels, pumping through. I can see it in my mind\\'s eye; our car hurdling through the dark, skating towards the other skeletal vehicle.  Then suddenly the tire, flat and losing air, must have broken free like some trapped bird. Here is the story I have repeated for twelve years: the tire flew off the car and hit ours. It smashed through our sunroof and carved scars into my leg.  As I sat in the ambulance and watched my legs bleed, my father read a children\\'s book to me. This provides my earliest memory; listening to Froggy All Year Round on the way to the hospital, clinging to words as the world folded in.  I had to wear a sleeve over my child\\'s legs, which were marked with two-hundred and eight stitches. In time flesh spread a lacy covering over them, and soon they could be exposed to the sun.  We won enough money in court to operate over the scars that to this day still twine through the flesh of my right leg \\\\u2013 to make them smooth again. But I never wanted new skin. The scars are continents on my body, formed from the glass that fell and tore my skin. They are tattooed reminders of the transience of life, the way the world can change in a split second.   They have become part of me, stories to be told. With the texture on my own skin comes a desire to travel and hear other people\\'s stories. I want to learn about the workings of the mind, and to understand the way mythology connects to the present, and to examine the histories and cultures of distant places. I will collect more stories with the dollars that were meant to strip me of them.   We live in a society where imperfections are often considered taboo, and where we are expected to be carbon copies of each other, but this negates all possibility of growth and self-expression. I want to sink my teeth into the world and make my mark upon it. I want to collect stories, even if they manifest themselves on my skin.  Today I hold words as closely as I did back in the whiteness of that ambulance. The story I heard as the world collapsed around me so long ago formed a house inside my chest, and I hope to build a home for others with my writing in the same way that children\\'s book did for me. On dark days when the world seems to shatter, I find I can turn the pieces into poetry and stories. Writing carries me deeper into the circulation of life, pumps inspiration through my veins, and illuminates uncharted shores in my heart, and I hope what I create can someday do the same for others. I write because it brings me to the edges of the world that could so easily have been taken away on that summer evening. I write to capture the intricate beauty of the changing of seasons, first introduced to me in a children\\'s book many years ago. I write to create songs that people can keep in the hollows of their ribcages, to be held closely on shadowy nights. I write to affirm the life pulsing through my veins, despite the imperfections on my skin. \"}, {\"index\": 979, \"new_personal_statement\": \"] Since I was young, my name has been worthless.

She tried to explain to me that everything would be okay, but Icouldn\\'t believe her.The warmth of the early September sun shined through the window onto my face. The birds were singing,the leaves were fading from their lively summer green, and I had just been shattered by the news that my mom was diagnosedwith cancer.While she tried to explain to me her prognosis, all I could think about was how I could possibly deal with my mother dying. Shewould have to suffer, and I could only watch. I felt powerless and afraidIt may seem, at least from the outside, that I was being melodramatic. Cancer is a serious challenge to face, but it is by nomeans a death-sentence. Based on previous experiences, however, I had no reason to believe that cancer and hope belongedin the same sentence.When I was six I already witnessed what cancer could do as it took a girl that was essentially a sister to me. My parents had tosit me down and explain that Meghan, just an innocent sixteen year-old girl, would no longer be around to play with me. Thenthere was my grandma, Yiayia as I called her, who lost her life to breast cancer only a few years later. By then I was oldenough to understand what had happened. I would no longer get to experience the excitement of her walking through the doorevery Sunday night holding a blueberry pie, my favorite. Now the faceless thief of life had returned to take my mother from me,and I had no idea how to deal with it.I entered my freshman year of high school with a weight on my shoulders. I couldn\\'t focus on my schoolwork, and I would makeexcuses so I didn\\'t have to see my friends. What I hated the most, however, was that the cancer had taken much of the joy thatI used to experience when I got to spend time with my family, a rare occurrence with both my brother and sister away at school.Instead of letting the cancer control her life, my mother took a very different approach.I remember one day my mother camedown the stairs giggling as she held her ponytail in one hand, and scissors in the other. She had a bright blue hat on her headthat read \\'Cancer Sucks\\'. Despite the fact that the cancer had already begun stealing her thick, long hair, I couldn\\'t help butgiggle along with her at how goofy she looked. My mom took the diagnosis as just another challenge that she would overcome.She wouldn\\'t let it get in the way of her enjoying life.Even as chemotherapy became more intense, and her symptoms became worse, I could always see a fire in her eyes. So Ibegan to push on, using my mom\\'s attitude to help me take back control of my life, and within eighteen months she wasdeemed cancer free. I felt like life could finally feel normal again, but that luxury only lasted for a little while.It was late August, almost two years from my mother\\'s initial cancer diagnosis. The strong heat of Summer permeated myroom. The afternoon air was silent, the leaves still held their summer vigor, and I was struck by the news that my mom\\'s cancerhad returned. After two years, however, things felt different. I grabbed her hand, and began to tell her that everything would beokay. By watching my mom, I had learned how to face a difficult situation. This time, I knew that the diagnosis wouldn\\'t controlmy life. This time I knew that I would be the stable foundation for my mom. This time I knew that she wouldn\\'t have to beat italone. \"}]}'"
