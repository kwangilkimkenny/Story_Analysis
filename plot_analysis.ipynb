    "text = \"\"\"His glittered hand reaches for mine, and I swiftly yank my arm back to avoid contact. Hurt momentarily clouds his eyes, but his excitement soon returns once he rejoins the chaos of the parade. As the surrounding clamor of drag queens and rainbow motorcycles drifts into my periphery, a desperate isolation overcomes me. This march is my community's grandest welcome party\\u2014the epitome of acceptance\\u2014yet why do I feel like an excluded spectator? Shouldn't my rainbow flag also be fluttering in the air, not neatly furled beneath my jacket?My gnawing guilt feels all too familiar. It's what I first experienced when I spotted Jethro, then a freshman, in the school parking lot. While half of me basked in awe of his high heels and rainbow bandana, my other half suffered a creeping discomfort. Dad, expectedly, only expressed the latter.'Look, I know you're different too...but you're not that different right?''No, of course not.''Good.'As having just come out as gay, that fleeting conversation warped my self-perception. It solidified an arbitrary line between acceptable and detestable, leading me struggling to display idealized teenage masculinity. Instead of culinary documentaries, football. Gardening and watercolors became hobbies of history. I knew I succumbed to internalized homophobia, but conformity provided security. I preferred feeling confused and deprived to facing any negativity from expressing myself candidly.Thankfully, Jethro entered my life again\\u2014this time on Instagram, where he passionately rebuked discriminatory comments. I attempted a facade of indifference, but subconsciously I resonated with his vulnerability and\\u2014surprisingly\\u2014courage. When he concluded with 'We have nothing to be sorry for,' I actually started to believe it.That millisecond of empowerment slowly became a feeling I craved. Thus, I ventured into the world of activism, but since my initial anxieties lingered, I remained anonymous. Through storytelling, I connected with others who confronted similar difficulties, writing and sharing blog posts about my social experiences. When my city back-lashed against California's new LGBTQ+-inclusive sexual education curriculum, I interviewed dozens of students on identity to compile their voices into a magazine, weaving together narratives of mental health, sexuality, and self-acceptance. Did it obliterate homophobia? No. But it certainly revealed perspectives that had been suppressed for too long. I was honestly proud of my project, yet I still obscured my name and story due to fear.The blare of horns drags me back to the present, and suddenly, I realize this march might be my final chance to escape hypocrisy and reclaim my activism. I urge others to live freely, but how can I do so when I shudder at the thought of being recognized with a rainbow flag?Here and now, I must accept that being gay does define me. Not as being predisposed to enjoy art and horticulture, but through my journey towards self-acceptance, I have gained a refined sensitivity to the struggles of others. I listen, I understand, and when others are lost, I extend my own experiences to empathize with their hardships. These qualities all contribute to my ability to tell compelling stories, a cornerstone of activism, but detached from their authors, stories are just hollow words. To truly empower others in the future, especially those in silence like I was, I can't shy away from the spotlight. I must let all my readers know that I am a tangible individual who is unashamed to exude my story truthfully.Before releasing my first real 'About Me' blog post, I unzip my jacket and reveal my flag. Uplifted by my thrill of starting a new chapter, my arm reaches higher into the canopy of confetti, and I stare wondrously at the colors rippling above. Finally, I feel no more doubt and no more fear: I break free from the sidelines and joyously clasp the next hand offered.I am a staunch opponent of the belief 'Stick to your passions early.' At best, this advice is idealistic, and at worst, it limits exploration. When I first volunteered as a science instructor at a local elementary school, this dogma was rampant, rigidifying curriculum and intimidating students.As cofounder and Director of Outreach of the non-profit organization Stemnova, I sought to eliminate the walls that suffocated STEM education. By our second year, I grew ambitious. I was determined to take steps to reinvent local perceptions of science bigger than the small fundraisers and science nights we had organized before.Thus, Stemnova partnered with the state Science Olympiad organization to host the first student-run tournament on the West Coast. Although our mission was daunting, I knew it was key to proving to our community that science is not compartmentalized. The competition committee I organized creatively planned each event down to the finest detail. For epidemiology, we incorporated novel computer models; for chemistry, we devised labs inspired by botany and nutritional sciences, and for experimental design, we blended together physics and biology. Each minute of the tournament was a sacred chance to exhibit the applicability and interdisciplinary nature of science.By the invitational's end, it was evident our purpose reached the students - at least half their questions for our professional guest speakers linked together various scientific fields. Though some parents still seemed confused, I was content that we had influenced the minds that mattered the most. The awards ceremony was an revelatory moment. Not only did I recognize the current impacts of my leadership, but I also began to envision what my innovative potential could bring in the future - an unbounded educational landscape. I felt empowered by both the students' excitement and my volunteers' own devotions to materializing something we had initially struggled to define. Our competition was a first for many, and I am still proud of myself and my team for devising an experience that broadened the next generation's understandings and encouraged their once suppressed desire to explore.Like an unscratchable itch, the Finite Heartbeat Theory tugs constantly at my curiosities. Its hypothesis is simple - we have a predetermined number of heartbeats. When my half-pseudoscientist, half-biology teacher first exclaimed this to our class years ago, my seventh-grade self believed it wholeheartedly.By ninth grade, I feared the heart. With Grandpa passing away from a heart attack and my teacher's words still echoing in my head, I viewed the heart as a ticking time bomb. From my apprehension, however, spawned a cautious interest towards cardiology: I was perpetually haunted by the question 'How many heartbeats left?'My concerns brought me into the Priest Laboratory for Pediatric Cardiology through the Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer Research Program. Hoping to characterize diabetes' effects on prenatal heart development, I dissected fetal hearts and submerged them in toxic, diabetic conditions overnight.The next morning, as I examined the petri dish with a microscope, I could barely grapple with what I saw - the hearts still beat, oblivious to their caustic surroundings. What I once perceived as a doomed organ suddenly transformed into a vessel of resilience. Before, my interest in cardiology was rooted in foreboding, but, now, it stemmed from a newfound appreciation for the heart's endurance despite adversary. My epiphany spawned fresh queries and perspectives. As I reminisced my Grandpa's own passing, I refused to anxiously calculate how many heartbeats he used. Instead, I began to inquire how I could better the lives of my parents, remembering my own father's cardiovascular disease.These questions led me to where I am today, researching pediatric cardiology in the Priest Lab and observing cardiac stem cell therapy in the Wu Lab. Every day, my work, from cultivating cells to evaluating genetic data, is inspired by my faith in the heart's tenacity, and through pursuing cardiology, I have sharpened my experimental acumen and diversified my scientific skillset. Occasionally, I still ponder over the truth of the Finite Heartbeat Theory, but I always arrive at the same conclusion - with limited heartbeats, I better seize opportunity now and fully dedicate myself to understanding the heart's complexity.Since childhood, I have always been fascinated with the Wubble Bubble. It was simple yet entertaining - its tinted surface humorously distorting my friend's whispers as they floated through the ball to my ear. While my Wubble Bubble now remains deflated in my garage, my fascination with bubbles is still very much afloat. Fortunately - or unfortunately as I have come to recognize - I don't have to look far to find one. In fact, I live in one.In middle school, I loved my Bay Area bubble, grateful that it shielded my community's pride parades and cultural celebrations. However, I grew complacent despite the emerging discrimination in our communities. In early 2018 when California released a more progressive sexual education curriculum, I was snapped out of this illusion. Watching the school board meeting livestream, with its homophobic undertones and disregard for mental health, shocked me. That night, I felt anxious yet impassioned. Being gay myself, I was terrified at the thought of being an outcast, but, simultaneously, I was angry that my identity was considered 'inappropriate' to share. A newfound fervor subsequently overtook me, and with my yearbook experience and the design talent of my friend, I sought to create a magazine to highlight the neglected voices of Fremont's youth. We originally intended to only focus on sexuality, but soon after interviewing dozens of students, we broadened our project to illuminate stories of body positivity, depression, stress, and abusive relationships. Titled 'Miscellany,' our magazine both distributed overlooked narratives to an audience and served as an outlet for emotional release for its contributors. It fostered empathy as it circulated in classrooms and homes, and I am still inspired by accounts from my closest friend's brother that less and less students at his elementary school are using once-prevalent homophobic language.Today, frankly, I am not sure how many individuals have flipped through my magazine - maybe hundreds, perhaps thousands. But I do know that even if only one person reads one story, that is still an important step towards spotlighting shrouded perspectives and solidifying the foundations for a more accepting Fremont.The first time I ever heard a recording of my debate speech, it was torture. It was less what I said, but more how I said it. My voice, both nasal and high-pitched, was excruciating to the ear, and immediately, what I once overlooked bolted to the forefront of my insecurities.In high school, with everyone changing, my distinct voice brought along with it belittling stereotypes: each 'What's up with you high voice?' and 'Your voice is gay' cornered me into silence and isolation. Competing in debate only amplified my anxiety, so futilely, I practiced diaphragm stretches and speaking exercises to deepen my voice. These activities were distractions from reading and developing cases, but I committed to them anyway, leading to a tragic string of losses.Junior year, before a national tournament, my voice disappeared. Sounding like a whelping animal during my vocal exercises, my fear quickly evolved into resignation. Since I couldn't speak, I spent my night determinedly researching instead, half hoping that maybe I could win on the premise of knowledge.That weekend, even with my relentless coughing, my partner and I advanced into the top thirty-two. Though we received just a flimsy certificate, it meant so much more to me as it was the first tangible evidence that challenged my insecurities. While my fingers ran along the paper, I realized what had distinguished this tournament was that I had actually focused on something changeable - my knowledge - instead of a constant factor. Before, my self-consciousness blinded me from spotting any actual opportunities for growth.Today, my voice is a reminder of my own resilience and adaptability. From this struggle, I have come to grasp the importance of perspective in learning, that I should focus on malleable factors to propel myself forward. This process of overcoming my linear thinking has influenced me to constantly reevaluate my problems and identify affectable areas of improvement: self-improvement is only achievable through reason and passion. Now, I am no longer concerned about my voice. Instead, I am driven to use it as a powerful tool to better engage my curiosities.\"},{\"index\":1,\"personal_essay\":\"To kill or not to kill is a question that has taunted me since June. Where my inner biologist yearned to dissect all the mice in the world (for science, of course), my inner ethicist questioned my sacrifices' purposes. After all, these were living creatures in my hands: what set them so apart from me that justified their role as test subjects?From perusing Peter Singer's Animal Liberation to attending cardiology conferences, answering the same concern from various lenses piqued my passion for bioethics, a synergy of biology, socio-cultural politics, and philosophy. I loved dissections and protein assays, compiling pieces of life's puzzle, but increasingly, I realized my research didn't function in a vacuum. Minutiae, including how we rationally perceive animals, does affect our human-to-human interactions, and the possibility that biology can be ethically improved as a discipline leads me to investigate potential solutions.The College of Arts and Science's Health and Societies major is, essentially, bioethics on steroids. It is one of the only programs I've found that shares my mission to unravel science's moral complexities. I ultimately aspire to be a genetic engineer, a trailblazer in healthcare. However, as the pioneer of gene-editing Jennifer Doudna warns in A Crack in Creation, it is a powerful profession that deserves deep contemplation.For instance, with parents soon being able to edit fetal traits such as autism or sexuality, I can't help but wonder if these efforts are inherently discriminatory. Perhaps, in Modern Biology and Social Implications or Darwin's Legacy, I'll discover some semblance of an answer. Analyzing current events with classmates, such as China's rogue designer-babies, is the best medium for me to examine innovation's social responsibilities. Meanwhile, studying historical Darwinistic theory is key to understanding modern ableism and homophobia. I hope to lob philosophical questions across the room, engage in existential discussions, then translate theory into practice by interning with the Bucan Lab. On the forefront of studying behavioral genetics, I can not only witness firsthand autism research, but also start bioethical conversations with colleagues. I'd like to ask Professor Bucan the safety of gene-editing: how do we ensure altering particular genes won't have any harmful off-target effects?Beyond the University of Pennsylvania's individual opportunities is its commitment to fostering community. The course Culture, Production, and Consumption in the Global Marketplace best embodies this value. On one hand, I'm eager to discuss with peers how healthcare is shaped by consumerism, but on the other, I'd like to listen to their experiences of growing up in a contemporary, capitalistic society. Even better is that we can do all this while exploring Philadelphia, relishing the cuisine and museums of an international city.Furthermore, I dream to bring this element of collective discovery beyond campus. Whether it be the student-run Engineers Without Borders or the International Honors Programs' Health and Community initiative, the University of Pennsylvania's support for worldly scholarship is inspiring. Meshing ethics, bioengineering, and sociology to address global health challenges livens my curiosities, and I seek to investigate how healthcare functions in different sociocultural contexts abroad, specifically its inclusion and exclusion of certain populations. These experiences all contribute to my Health and Societies' senior capstone project: I yearn to unite my extracurriculars and academics by focusing on worldwide queer mental health disparities and possible medical solutions.Biological innovations, such as genetic engineering, address many of our woes, but with new developments comes new moral concerns. More and more, science intersects with philosophy, politics, and culture, and I value majoring in Health and Societies to be conscientious of these crossroads. The University of Pennsylvania's thoughtful and interdisciplinary landscape, thus, beckons me. I dream to join its haven for intellectual reflection, delve into the nuances of scientific advancements, and maybe\\u2014if time permits\\u2014get back to answering the question to kill or not to kill.How will you explore your intellectual and academic interests at the University of Pennsylvania? Please answer this question given the specific undergraduate school to which you are applying. (400-650 words) Sustainability. A gardener myself, I'm already enamored by Dartmouth's camaraderie with nature. Whether it be bee-keeping with classmates or relaxing in the organic farm alone, each facet of campus is a chance to humble myself, to reaffirm my appreciation for Earth.This self-effacing curiosity pervades Dartmouth's D-Plan. If I'm going to be studying tropical-biology, I'm joining a foreign-study program to gather real samples in Caribbean reefs. If I want to grasp science's role in society, I'm using my sophomore summer to debate peers in Ethics and Information Technology. Dartmouth ultimately fosters a sustainable education: time and learning are never wasted.While arguing a Dartmouth-related case before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1818, Daniel Webster, Class of 1801, delivered this memorable line: 'It is, Sir\\u2026a small college. And yet, there are those who love it!' As you seek admission to the Class of 2023, what aspects of the College's program, community or campus environment attract your interest?Jane was commended for being a survivor.Clad in invisible armor, defiant against injustice\\u2014that's how we imagined her as her story of sexual assault circulated. We deemed her a hero, nearing superhuman, but\\u2014as Jane would confide in me later\\u2014not once did our hasty label reflect her struggles honestly.To her, survivor implied that the worst was over, sidelining her depression for a more palatable story of overcoming. Our words weren't ill-intentioned, but certainly, they were ill-informed. I realized we succumbed to a grander cultural problem\\u2014one that sentimentalizes and misrepresents sexual assault, discouraging reporting and de-prioritizing long-term care.From volunteering in a rape-counseling center, I've grasped that shaping culture begins with shaping language. Similar to how normalizing gender-neutral pronouns promotes acceptance, how we describe assault must be more inclusive. By exploring Dartmouth's interdisciplinary courses United States of Queer and Inequality and Social Justice, I desire to interrogate with classmates the reforms activism needs to encompass all narratives.Subsequently, under the Student and Presidential Committee on Sexual Assault, I seek to translate theory into justice. Joining peers will not only offer me a platform to cultivate student-administration dialogue, but also resources to pursue solutions for sexual assault's psychological consequences. With an Elizabeth A. Hoffman Research Grant, I can investigate the strengths of differing therapy techniques at Dartmouth's National Center for PTSD, later bringing my findings to the table for debate. How should we improve existing campus mental-health support systems?Sexual assault shouldn't be a tokenized story or glorified narrative. Dartmouth's expressive, multifaceted community is a haven to foster this ideal, to devise the most holistic solutions for sexual violence. I strive to be a better ally for Jane and others, but first I must address our misguided words and assumptions. Therein, however, lies the beauty of language\\u2014only discussion rectifies it, not silence.In the aftermath of World War II, Dartmouth President John Sloane Dickey, Class of 1929, proclaimed, 'The world's troubles are your troubles\\u2026and there is nothing wrong with the world that better human beings cannot fix.' Which of the world's 'troubles' inspires you to act? How might your course of study at Dartmouth prepare you to address it?My love for collective adventures leads me to Duke. I've traversed Yosemite, scuba-dived with family, but none of these experiences even compare to the excitement of tenting with friends, braving the cold for a taste of athletic thrill. Between games, I'm eager to explore Duke's various social niches. The International Cooking Club shines in particular: I'm giddy to embrace my surrounding diversity and share my own Taiwanese recipes.This love for community extends into academics. As an aspiring cognitive-neurobiologist, the Lemur Center and its tight-knit team of interdisciplinary scientists uniquely appeals to me. Investigating primate biology is the best mechanism for medical research, much more efficient than mice-models. With my previous experience untangling developmental-genetics, I hope to contribute to the center's deciphering of neurodegenerative disease.Every facet of Duke is ultimately a collective adventure. Whether that be chanting Blue Devils! or observing lemurs, I know I'll always be at home.If you are applying to the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences as a first year applicant, please discuss why you consider Duke a good match for you. Is there something particular about Duke that attracts you? (Please limit your response to no more than 150 words.)Jane was commended for being a survivor.Clad in invisible armor and defiant against injustice\\u2014that's how we imagined her as her story of sexual assault circulated. We deemed her a hero, nearing superhuman, but\\u2014as Jane would confide in me later\\u2014not once did our hasty label reflect her struggles honestly.To her, survivor implied that the worst was over. It sidelined her depression for a more palatable story of overcoming. Our words weren't ill-intentioned, but certainly, they were ill-informed. Unknowingly, we succumbed to society's habit of misrepresenting sexual assault, fostering a claustrophobic environment hostile to truth.Some call it nitpicky political-correctness, but shaping culture must begin with shaping language. Survivor versus victim or gender-neutral pronouns seem insignificant, but from volunteering at the rape-counseling center, I've realized these minutiae do matter to vulnerable individuals in my community. Words legitimize our experiences, our identities, and when others abuse or mischaracterize us with them, shame arises. It's when my suffering and tears were once ridiculed as gay, when Jane's narrative was tokenized for public inspiration.For me, however, language's fluidity signifies hope. In my current project with Bay Area Women Against Rape, I embrace engaging law enforcement through creating awareness curriculum to re-evaluate how we address sexual assault. Instead of this what I think, it's what do you prefer?\\u2014words should be empathetic tools to empower people to express their own stories. To be a better ally for Jane, myself, and others, I find purpose in molding discourse. Thankfully, only discussion rectifies language, not silence.Duke University seeks a talented, engaged student body that embodies the wide range of human experience; we believe that the diversity of our students makes our community stronger. If you'd like to share a perspective you bring or experiences you've had to help us understand you better-perhaps related to a community you belong to or your family or cultural background-we encourage you to do so. Real people are reading your application, and we want to do our best to understand and appreciate the real people applying to Duke. \"\"\""

    "text = \"\"\"His glittered hand reaches for mine, and I swiftly yank my arm back to avoid contact. Hurt momentarily clouds his eyes, but his excitement soon returns once he rejoins the chaos of the parade. As the surrounding clamor of drag queens and rainbow motorcycles drifts into my periphery, a desperate isolation overcomes me. This march is my community's grandest welcome party\\u2014the epitome of acceptance\\u2014yet why do I feel like an excluded spectator? Shouldn't my rainbow flag also be fluttering in the air, not neatly furled beneath my jacket?My gnawing guilt feels all too familiar. It's what I first experienced when I spotted Jethro, then a freshman, in the school parking lot. While half of me basked in awe of his high heels and rainbow bandana, my other half suffered a creeping discomfort. Dad, expectedly, only expressed the latter.'Look, I know you're different too...but you're not that different right?''No, of course not.''Good.'As having just come out as gay, that fleeting conversation warped my self-perception. It solidified an arbitrary line between acceptable and detestable, leading me struggling to display idealized teenage masculinity. Instead of culinary documentaries, football. Gardening and watercolors became hobbies of history. I knew I succumbed to internalized homophobia, but conformity provided security. I preferred feeling confused and deprived to facing any negativity from expressing myself candidly.Thankfully, Jethro entered my life again\\u2014this time on Instagram, where he passionately rebuked discriminatory comments. I attempted a facade of indifference, but subconsciously I resonated with his vulnerability and\\u2014surprisingly\\u2014courage. When he concluded with 'We have nothing to be sorry for,' I actually started to believe it.That millisecond of empowerment slowly became a feeling I craved. Thus, I ventured into the world of activism, but since my initial anxieties lingered, I remained anonymous. Through storytelling, I connected with others who confronted similar difficulties, writing and sharing blog posts about my social experiences. When my city back-lashed against California's new LGBTQ+-inclusive sexual education curriculum, I interviewed dozens of students on identity to compile their voices into a magazine, weaving together narratives of mental health, sexuality, and self-acceptance. Did it obliterate homophobia? No. But it certainly revealed perspectives that had been suppressed for too long. I was honestly proud of my project, yet I still obscured my name and story due to fear.The blare of horns drags me back to the present, and suddenly, I realize this march might be my final chance to escape hypocrisy and reclaim my activism. I urge others to live freely, but how can I do so when I shudder at the thought of being recognized with a rainbow flag?Here and now, I must accept that being gay does define me. Not as being predisposed to enjoy art and horticulture, but through my journey towards self-acceptance, I have gained a refined sensitivity to the struggles of others. I listen, I understand, and when others are lost, I extend my own experiences to empathize with their hardships. These qualities all contribute to my ability to tell compelling stories, a cornerstone of activism, but detached from their authors, stories are just hollow words. To truly empower others in the future, especially those in silence like I was, I can't shy away from the spotlight. I must let all my readers know that I am a tangible individual who is unashamed to exude my story truthfully.Before releasing my first real 'About Me' blog post, I unzip my jacket and reveal my flag. Uplifted by my thrill of starting a new chapter, my arm reaches higher into the canopy of confetti, and I stare wondrously at the colors rippling above. Finally, I feel no more doubt and no more fear: I break free from the sidelines and joyously clasp the next hand offered.I am a staunch opponent of the belief 'Stick to your passions early.' At best, this advice is idealistic, and at worst, it limits exploration. When I first volunteered as a science instructor at a local elementary school, this dogma was rampant, rigidifying curriculum and intimidating students.As cofounder and Director of Outreach of the non-profit organization Stemnova, I sought to eliminate the walls that suffocated STEM education. By our second year, I grew ambitious. I was determined to take steps to reinvent local perceptions of science bigger than the small fundraisers and science nights we had organized before.Thus, Stemnova partnered with the state Science Olympiad organization to host the first student-run tournament on the West Coast. Although our mission was daunting, I knew it was key to proving to our community that science is not compartmentalized. The competition committee I organized creatively planned each event down to the finest detail. For epidemiology, we incorporated novel computer models; for chemistry, we devised labs inspired by botany and nutritional sciences, and for experimental design, we blended together physics and biology. Each minute of the tournament was a sacred chance to exhibit the applicability and interdisciplinary nature of science.By the invitational's end, it was evident our purpose reached the students - at least half their questions for our professional guest speakers linked together various scientific fields. Though some parents still seemed confused, I was content that we had influenced the minds that mattered the most. The awards ceremony was an revelatory moment. Not only did I recognize the current impacts of my leadership, but I also began to envision what my innovative potential could bring in the future - an unbounded educational landscape. I felt empowered by both the students' excitement and my volunteers' own devotions to materializing something we had initially struggled to define. Our competition was a first for many, and I am still proud of myself and my team for devising an experience that broadened the next generation's understandings and encouraged their once suppressed desire to explore.Like an unscratchable itch, the Finite Heartbeat Theory tugs constantly at my curiosities. Its hypothesis is simple - we have a predetermined number of heartbeats. When my half-pseudoscientist, half-biology teacher first exclaimed this to our class years ago, my seventh-grade self believed it wholeheartedly.By ninth grade, I feared the heart. With Grandpa passing away from a heart attack and my teacher's words still echoing in my head, I viewed the heart as a ticking time bomb. From my apprehension, however, spawned a cautious interest towards cardiology: I was perpetually haunted by the question 'How many heartbeats left?'My concerns brought me into the Priest Laboratory for Pediatric Cardiology through the Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer Research Program. Hoping to characterize diabetes' effects on prenatal heart development, I dissected fetal hearts and submerged them in toxic, diabetic conditions overnight.The next morning, as I examined the petri dish with a microscope, I could barely grapple with what I saw - the hearts still beat, oblivious to their caustic surroundings. What I once perceived as a doomed organ suddenly transformed into a vessel of resilience. Before, my interest in cardiology was rooted in foreboding, but, now, it stemmed from a newfound appreciation for the heart's endurance despite adversary. My epiphany spawned fresh queries and perspectives. As I reminisced my Grandpa's own passing, I refused to anxiously calculate how many heartbeats he used. Instead, I began to inquire how I could better the lives of my parents, remembering my own father's cardiovascular disease.These questions led me to where I am today, researching pediatric cardiology in the Priest Lab and observing cardiac stem cell therapy in the Wu Lab. Every day, my work, from cultivating cells to evaluating genetic data, is inspired by my faith in the heart's tenacity, and through pursuing cardiology, I have sharpened my experimental acumen and diversified my scientific skillset. Occasionally, I still ponder over the truth of the Finite Heartbeat Theory, but I always arrive at the same conclusion - with limited heartbeats, I better seize opportunity now and fully dedicate myself to understanding the heart's complexity.Since childhood, I have always been fascinated with the Wubble Bubble. It was simple yet entertaining - its tinted surface humorously distorting my friend's whispers as they floated through the ball to my ear. While my Wubble Bubble now remains deflated in my garage, my fascination with bubbles is still very much afloat. Fortunately - or unfortunately as I have come to recognize - I don't have to look far to find one. In fact, I live in one.In middle school, I loved my Bay Area bubble, grateful that it shielded my community's pride parades and cultural celebrations. However, I grew complacent despite the emerging discrimination in our communities. In early 2018 when California released a more progressive sexual education curriculum, I was snapped out of this illusion. Watching the school board meeting livestream, with its homophobic undertones and disregard for mental health, shocked me. That night, I felt anxious yet impassioned. Being gay myself, I was terrified at the thought of being an outcast, but, simultaneously, I was angry that my identity was considered 'inappropriate' to share. A newfound fervor subsequently overtook me, and with my yearbook experience and the design talent of my friend, I sought to create a magazine to highlight the neglected voices of Fremont's youth. We originally intended to only focus on sexuality, but soon after interviewing dozens of students, we broadened our project to illuminate stories of body positivity, depression, stress, and abusive relationships. Titled 'Miscellany,' our magazine both distributed overlooked narratives to an audience and served as an outlet for emotional release for its contributors. It fostered empathy as it circulated in classrooms and homes, and I am still inspired by accounts from my closest friend's brother that less and less students at his elementary school are using once-prevalent homophobic language.Today, frankly, I am not sure how many individuals have flipped through my magazine - maybe hundreds, perhaps thousands. But I do know that even if only one person reads one story, that is still an important step towards spotlighting shrouded perspectives and solidifying the foundations for a more accepting Fremont.The first time I ever heard a recording of my debate speech, it was torture. It was less what I said, but more how I said it. My voice, both nasal and high-pitched, was excruciating to the ear, and immediately, what I once overlooked bolted to the forefront of my insecurities.In high school, with everyone changing, my distinct voice brought along with it belittling stereotypes: each 'What's up with you high voice?' and 'Your voice is gay' cornered me into silence and isolation. Competing in debate only amplified my anxiety, so futilely, I practiced diaphragm stretches and speaking exercises to deepen my voice. These activities were distractions from reading and developing cases, but I committed to them anyway, leading to a tragic string of losses.Junior year, before a national tournament, my voice disappeared. Sounding like a whelping animal during my vocal exercises, my fear quickly evolved into resignation. Since I couldn't speak, I spent my night determinedly researching instead, half hoping that maybe I could win on the premise of knowledge.That weekend, even with my relentless coughing, my partner and I advanced into the top thirty-two. Though we received just a flimsy certificate, it meant so much more to me as it was the first tangible evidence that challenged my insecurities. While my fingers ran along the paper, I realized what had distinguished this tournament was that I had actually focused on something changeable - my knowledge - instead of a constant factor. Before, my self-consciousness blinded me from spotting any actual opportunities for growth.Today, my voice is a reminder of my own resilience and adaptability. From this struggle, I have come to grasp the importance of perspective in learning, that I should focus on malleable factors to propel myself forward. This process of overcoming my linear thinking has influenced me to constantly reevaluate my problems and identify affectable areas of improvement: self-improvement is only achievable through reason and passion. Now, I am no longer concerned about my voice. Instead, I am driven to use it as a powerful tool to better engage my curiosities.\"},{\"index\":1,\"personal_essay\":\"To kill or not to kill is a question that has taunted me since June. Where my inner biologist yearned to dissect all the mice in the world (for science, of course), my inner ethicist questioned my sacrifices' purposes. After all, these were living creatures in my hands: what set them so apart from me that justified their role as test subjects?From perusing Peter Singer's Animal Liberation to attending cardiology conferences, answering the same concern from various lenses piqued my passion for bioethics, a synergy of biology, socio-cultural politics, and philosophy. I loved dissections and protein assays, compiling pieces of life's puzzle, but increasingly, I realized my research didn't function in a vacuum. Minutiae, including how we rationally perceive animals, does affect our human-to-human interactions, and the possibility that biology can be ethically improved as a discipline leads me to investigate potential solutions.The College of Arts and Science's Health and Societies major is, essentially, bioethics on steroids. It is one of the only programs I've found that shares my mission to unravel science's moral complexities. I ultimately aspire to be a genetic engineer, a trailblazer in healthcare. However, as the pioneer of gene-editing Jennifer Doudna warns in A Crack in Creation, it is a powerful profession that deserves deep contemplation.For instance, with parents soon being able to edit fetal traits such as autism or sexuality, I can't help but wonder if these efforts are inherently discriminatory. Perhaps, in Modern Biology and Social Implications or Darwin's Legacy, I'll discover some semblance of an answer. Analyzing current events with classmates, such as China's rogue designer-babies, is the best medium for me to examine innovation's social responsibilities. Meanwhile, studying historical Darwinistic theory is key to understanding modern ableism and homophobia. I hope to lob philosophical questions across the room, engage in existential discussions, then translate theory into practice by interning with the Bucan Lab. On the forefront of studying behavioral genetics, I can not only witness firsthand autism research, but also start bioethical conversations with colleagues. I'd like to ask Professor Bucan the safety of gene-editing: how do we ensure altering particular genes won't have any harmful off-target effects?Beyond the University of Pennsylvania's individual opportunities is its commitment to fostering community. The course Culture, Production, and Consumption in the Global Marketplace best embodies this value. On one hand, I'm eager to discuss with peers how healthcare is shaped by consumerism, but on the other, I'd like to listen to their experiences of growing up in a contemporary, capitalistic society. Even better is that we can do all this while exploring Philadelphia, relishing the cuisine and museums of an international city.Furthermore, I dream to bring this element of collective discovery beyond campus. Whether it be the student-run Engineers Without Borders or the International Honors Programs' Health and Community initiative, the University of Pennsylvania's support for worldly scholarship is inspiring. Meshing ethics, bioengineering, and sociology to address global health challenges livens my curiosities, and I seek to investigate how healthcare functions in different sociocultural contexts abroad, specifically its inclusion and exclusion of certain populations. These experiences all contribute to my Health and Societies' senior capstone project: I yearn to unite my extracurriculars and academics by focusing on worldwide queer mental health disparities and possible medical solutions.Biological innovations, such as genetic engineering, address many of our woes, but with new developments comes new moral concerns. More and more, science intersects with philosophy, politics, and culture, and I value majoring in Health and Societies to be conscientious of these crossroads. The University of Pennsylvania's thoughtful and interdisciplinary landscape, thus, beckons me. I dream to join its haven for intellectual reflection, delve into the nuances of scientific advancements, and maybe\\u2014if time permits\\u2014get back to answering the question to kill or not to kill.How will you explore your intellectual and academic interests at the University of Pennsylvania? Please answer this question given the specific undergraduate school to which you are applying. (400-650 words) Sustainability. A gardener myself, I'm already enamored by Dartmouth's camaraderie with nature. Whether it be bee-keeping with classmates or relaxing in the organic farm alone, each facet of campus is a chance to humble myself, to reaffirm my appreciation for Earth.This self-effacing curiosity pervades Dartmouth's D-Plan. If I'm going to be studying tropical-biology, I'm joining a foreign-study program to gather real samples in Caribbean reefs. If I want to grasp science's role in society, I'm using my sophomore summer to debate peers in Ethics and Information Technology. Dartmouth ultimately fosters a sustainable education: time and learning are never wasted.While arguing a Dartmouth-related case before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1818, Daniel Webster, Class of 1801, delivered this memorable line: 'It is, Sir\\u2026a small college. And yet, there are those who love it!' As you seek admission to the Class of 2023, what aspects of the College's program, community or campus environment attract your interest?Jane was commended for being a survivor.Clad in invisible armor, defiant against injustice\\u2014that's how we imagined her as her story of sexual assault circulated. We deemed her a hero, nearing superhuman, but\\u2014as Jane would confide in me later\\u2014not once did our hasty label reflect her struggles honestly.To her, survivor implied that the worst was over, sidelining her depression for a more palatable story of overcoming. Our words weren't ill-intentioned, but certainly, they were ill-informed. I realized we succumbed to a grander cultural problem\\u2014one that sentimentalizes and misrepresents sexual assault, discouraging reporting and de-prioritizing long-term care.From volunteering in a rape-counseling center, I've grasped that shaping culture begins with shaping language. Similar to how normalizing gender-neutral pronouns promotes acceptance, how we describe assault must be more inclusive. By exploring Dartmouth's interdisciplinary courses United States of Queer and Inequality and Social Justice, I desire to interrogate with classmates the reforms activism needs to encompass all narratives.Subsequently, under the Student and Presidential Committee on Sexual Assault, I seek to translate theory into justice. Joining peers will not only offer me a platform to cultivate student-administration dialogue, but also resources to pursue solutions for sexual assault's psychological consequences. With an Elizabeth A. Hoffman Research Grant, I can investigate the strengths of differing therapy techniques at Dartmouth's National Center for PTSD, later bringing my findings to the table for debate. How should we improve existing campus mental-health support systems?Sexual assault shouldn't be a tokenized story or glorified narrative. Dartmouth's expressive, multifaceted community is a haven to foster this ideal, to devise the most holistic solutions for sexual violence. I strive to be a better ally for Jane and others, but first I must address our misguided words and assumptions. Therein, however, lies the beauty of language\\u2014only discussion rectifies it, not silence.In the aftermath of World War II, Dartmouth President John Sloane Dickey, Class of 1929, proclaimed, 'The world's troubles are your troubles\\u2026and there is nothing wrong with the world that better human beings cannot fix.' Which of the world's 'troubles' inspires you to act? How might your course of study at Dartmouth prepare you to address it?My love for collective adventures leads me to Duke. I've traversed Yosemite, scuba-dived with family, but none of these experiences even compare to the excitement of tenting with friends, braving the cold for a taste of athletic thrill. Between games, I'm eager to explore Duke's various social niches. The International Cooking Club shines in particular: I'm giddy to embrace my surrounding diversity and share my own Taiwanese recipes.This love for community extends into academics. As an aspiring cognitive-neurobiologist, the Lemur Center and its tight-knit team of interdisciplinary scientists uniquely appeals to me. Investigating primate biology is the best mechanism for medical research, much more efficient than mice-models. With my previous experience untangling developmental-genetics, I hope to contribute to the center's deciphering of neurodegenerative disease.Every facet of Duke is ultimately a collective adventure. Whether that be chanting Blue Devils! or observing lemurs, I know I'll always be at home.If you are applying to the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences as a first year applicant, please discuss why you consider Duke a good match for you. Is there something particular about Duke that attracts you? (Please limit your response to no more than 150 words.)Jane was commended for being a survivor.Clad in invisible armor and defiant against injustice\\u2014that's how we imagined her as her story of sexual assault circulated. We deemed her a hero, nearing superhuman, but\\u2014as Jane would confide in me later\\u2014not once did our hasty label reflect her struggles honestly.To her, survivor implied that the worst was over. It sidelined her depression for a more palatable story of overcoming. Our words weren't ill-intentioned, but certainly, they were ill-informed. Unknowingly, we succumbed to society's habit of misrepresenting sexual assault, fostering a claustrophobic environment hostile to truth.Some call it nitpicky political-correctness, but shaping culture must begin with shaping language. Survivor versus victim or gender-neutral pronouns seem insignificant, but from volunteering at the rape-counseling center, I've realized these minutiae do matter to vulnerable individuals in my community. Words legitimize our experiences, our identities, and when others abuse or mischaracterize us with them, shame arises. It's when my suffering and tears were once ridiculed as gay, when Jane's narrative was tokenized for public inspiration.For me, however, language's fluidity signifies hope. In my current project with Bay Area Women Against Rape, I embrace engaging law enforcement through creating awareness curriculum to re-evaluate how we address sexual assault. Instead of this what I think, it's what do you prefer?\\u2014words should be empathetic tools to empower people to express their own stories. To be a better ally for Jane, myself, and others, I find purpose in molding discourse. Thankfully, only discussion rectifies language, not silence.Duke University seeks a talented, engaged student body that embodies the wide range of human experience; we believe that the diversity of our students makes our community stronger. If you'd like to share a perspective you bring or experiences you've had to help us understand you better-perhaps related to a community you belong to or your family or cultural background-we encourage you to do so. Real people are reading your application, and we want to do our best to understand and appreciate the real people applying to Duke. \"\"\"\n",

    "text = \"\"\"His glittered hand reaches for mine, and I swiftly yank my arm back to avoid contact. Hurt momentarily clouds his eyes, but his excitement soon returns once he rejoins the chaos of the parade. As the surrounding clamor of drag queens and rainbow motorcycles drifts into my periphery, a desperate isolation overcomes me. This march is my community's grandest welcome party\\u2014the epitome of acceptance\\u2014yet why do I feel like an excluded spectator? Shouldn't my rainbow flag also be fluttering in the air, not neatly furled beneath my jacket?My gnawing guilt feels all too familiar. It's what I first experienced when I spotted Jethro, then a freshman, in the school parking lot. While half of me basked in awe of his high heels and rainbow bandana, my other half suffered a creeping discomfort. Dad, expectedly, only expressed the latter.'Look, I know you're different too...but you're not that different right?''No, of course not.''Good.'As having just come out as gay, that fleeting conversation warped my self-perception. It solidified an arbitrary line between acceptable and detestable, leading me struggling to display idealized teenage masculinity. Instead of culinary documentaries, football. Gardening and watercolors became hobbies of history. I knew I succumbed to internalized homophobia, but conformity provided security. I preferred feeling confused and deprived to facing any negativity from expressing myself candidly.Thankfully, Jethro entered my life again\\u2014this time on Instagram, where he passionately rebuked discriminatory comments. I attempted a facade of indifference, but subconsciously I resonated with his vulnerability and\\u2014surprisingly\\u2014courage. When he concluded with 'We have nothing to be sorry for,' I actually started to believe it.That millisecond of empowerment slowly became a feeling I craved. Thus, I ventured into the world of activism, but since my initial anxieties lingered, I remained anonymous. Through storytelling, I connected with others who confronted similar difficulties, writing and sharing blog posts about my social experiences. When my city back-lashed against California's new LGBTQ+-inclusive sexual education curriculum, I interviewed dozens of students on identity to compile their voices into a magazine, weaving together narratives of mental health, sexuality, and self-acceptance. Did it obliterate homophobia? No. But it certainly revealed perspectives that had been suppressed for too long. I was honestly proud of my project, yet I still obscured my name and story due to fear.The blare of horns drags me back to the present, and suddenly, I realize this march might be my final chance to escape hypocrisy and reclaim my activism. I urge others to live freely, but how can I do so when I shudder at the thought of being recognized with a rainbow flag?Here and now, I must accept that being gay does define me. Not as being predisposed to enjoy art and horticulture, but through my journey towards self-acceptance, I have gained a refined sensitivity to the struggles of others. I listen, I understand, and when others are lost, I extend my own experiences to empathize with their hardships. These qualities all contribute to my ability to tell compelling stories, a cornerstone of activism, but detached from their authors, stories are just hollow words. To truly empower others in the future, especially those in silence like I was, I can't shy away from the spotlight. I must let all my readers know that I am a tangible individual who is unashamed to exude my story truthfully.Before releasing my first real 'About Me' blog post, I unzip my jacket and reveal my flag. Uplifted by my thrill of starting a new chapter, my arm reaches higher into the canopy of confetti, and I stare wondrously at the colors rippling above. Finally, I feel no more doubt and no more fear: I break free from the sidelines and joyously clasp the next hand offered.I am a staunch opponent of the belief 'Stick to your passions early.' At best, this advice is idealistic, and at worst, it limits exploration. When I first volunteered as a science instructor at a local elementary school, this dogma was rampant, rigidifying curriculum and intimidating students.As cofounder and Director of Outreach of the non-profit organization Stemnova, I sought to eliminate the walls that suffocated STEM education. By our second year, I grew ambitious. I was determined to take steps to reinvent local perceptions of science bigger than the small fundraisers and science nights we had organized before.Thus, Stemnova partnered with the state Science Olympiad organization to host the first student-run tournament on the West Coast. Although our mission was daunting, I knew it was key to proving to our community that science is not compartmentalized. The competition committee I organized creatively planned each event down to the finest detail. For epidemiology, we incorporated novel computer models; for chemistry, we devised labs inspired by botany and nutritional sciences, and for experimental design, we blended together physics and biology. Each minute of the tournament was a sacred chance to exhibit the applicability and interdisciplinary nature of science.By the invitational's end, it was evident our purpose reached the students - at least half their questions for our professional guest speakers linked together various scientific fields. Though some parents still seemed confused, I was content that we had influenced the minds that mattered the most. The awards ceremony was an revelatory moment. Not only did I recognize the current impacts of my leadership, but I also began to envision what my innovative potential could bring in the future - an unbounded educational landscape. I felt empowered by both the students' excitement and my volunteers' own devotions to materializing something we had initially struggled to define. Our competition was a first for many, and I am still proud of myself and my team for devising an experience that broadened the next generation's understandings and encouraged their once suppressed desire to explore.Like an unscratchable itch, the Finite Heartbeat Theory tugs constantly at my curiosities. Its hypothesis is simple - we have a predetermined number of heartbeats. When my half-pseudoscientist, half-biology teacher first exclaimed this to our class years ago, my seventh-grade self believed it wholeheartedly.By ninth grade, I feared the heart. With Grandpa passing away from a heart attack and my teacher's words still echoing in my head, I viewed the heart as a ticking time bomb. From my apprehension, however, spawned a cautious interest towards cardiology: I was perpetually haunted by the question 'How many heartbeats left?'My concerns brought me into the Priest Laboratory for Pediatric Cardiology through the Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer Research Program. Hoping to characterize diabetes' effects on prenatal heart development, I dissected fetal hearts and submerged them in toxic, diabetic conditions overnight.The next morning, as I examined the petri dish with a microscope, I could barely grapple with what I saw - the hearts still beat, oblivious to their caustic surroundings. What I once perceived as a doomed organ suddenly transformed into a vessel of resilience. Before, my interest in cardiology was rooted in foreboding, but, now, it stemmed from a newfound appreciation for the heart's endurance despite adversary. My epiphany spawned fresh queries and perspectives. As I reminisced my Grandpa's own passing, I refused to anxiously calculate how many heartbeats he used. Instead, I began to inquire how I could better the lives of my parents, remembering my own father's cardiovascular disease.These questions led me to where I am today, researching pediatric cardiology in the Priest Lab and observing cardiac stem cell therapy in the Wu Lab. Every day, my work, from cultivating cells to evaluating genetic data, is inspired by my faith in the heart's tenacity, and through pursuing cardiology, I have sharpened my experimental acumen and diversified my scientific skillset. Occasionally, I still ponder over the truth of the Finite Heartbeat Theory, but I always arrive at the same conclusion - with limited heartbeats, I better seize opportunity now and fully dedicate myself to understanding the heart's complexity.Since childhood, I have always been fascinated with the Wubble Bubble. It was simple yet entertaining - its tinted surface humorously distorting my friend's whispers as they floated through the ball to my ear. While my Wubble Bubble now remains deflated in my garage, my fascination with bubbles is still very much afloat. Fortunately - or unfortunately as I have come to recognize - I don't have to look far to find one. In fact, I live in one.In middle school, I loved my Bay Area bubble, grateful that it shielded my community's pride parades and cultural celebrations. However, I grew complacent despite the emerging discrimination in our communities. In early 2018 when California released a more progressive sexual education curriculum, I was snapped out of this illusion. Watching the school board meeting livestream, with its homophobic undertones and disregard for mental health, shocked me. That night, I felt anxious yet impassioned. Being gay myself, I was terrified at the thought of being an outcast, but, simultaneously, I was angry that my identity was considered 'inappropriate' to share. A newfound fervor subsequently overtook me, and with my yearbook experience and the design talent of my friend, I sought to create a magazine to highlight the neglected voices of Fremont's youth. We originally intended to only focus on sexuality, but soon after interviewing dozens of students, we broadened our project to illuminate stories of body positivity, depression, stress, and abusive relationships. Titled 'Miscellany,' our magazine both distributed overlooked narratives to an audience and served as an outlet for emotional release for its contributors. It fostered empathy as it circulated in classrooms and homes, and I am still inspired by accounts from my closest friend's brother that less and less students at his elementary school are using once-prevalent homophobic language.Today, frankly, I am not sure how many individuals have flipped through my magazine - maybe hundreds, perhaps thousands. But I do know that even if only one person reads one story, that is still an important step towards spotlighting shrouded perspectives and solidifying the foundations for a more accepting Fremont.The first time I ever heard a recording of my debate speech, it was torture. It was less what I said, but more how I said it. My voice, both nasal and high-pitched, was excruciating to the ear, and immediately, what I once overlooked bolted to the forefront of my insecurities.In high school, with everyone changing, my distinct voice brought along with it belittling stereotypes: each 'What's up with you high voice?' and 'Your voice is gay' cornered me into silence and isolation. Competing in debate only amplified my anxiety, so futilely, I practiced diaphragm stretches and speaking exercises to deepen my voice. These activities were distractions from reading and developing cases, but I committed to them anyway, leading to a tragic string of losses.Junior year, before a national tournament, my voice disappeared. Sounding like a whelping animal during my vocal exercises, my fear quickly evolved into resignation. Since I couldn't speak, I spent my night determinedly researching instead, half hoping that maybe I could win on the premise of knowledge.That weekend, even with my relentless coughing, my partner and I advanced into the top thirty-two. Though we received just a flimsy certificate, it meant so much more to me as it was the first tangible evidence that challenged my insecurities. While my fingers ran along the paper, I realized what had distinguished this tournament was that I had actually focused on something changeable - my knowledge - instead of a constant factor. Before, my self-consciousness blinded me from spotting any actual opportunities for growth.Today, my voice is a reminder of my own resilience and adaptability. From this struggle, I have come to grasp the importance of perspective in learning, that I should focus on malleable factors to propel myself forward. This process of overcoming my linear thinking has influenced me to constantly reevaluate my problems and identify affectable areas of improvement: self-improvement is only achievable through reason and passion. Now, I am no longer concerned about my voice. Instead, I am driven to use it as a powerful tool to better engage my curiosities.\"},{\"index\":1,\"personal_essay\":\"To kill or not to kill is a question that has taunted me since June. Where my inner biologist yearned to dissect all the mice in the world (for science, of course), my inner ethicist questioned my sacrifices' purposes. After all, these were living creatures in my hands: what set them so apart from me that justified their role as test subjects?From perusing Peter Singer's Animal Liberation to attending cardiology conferences, answering the same concern from various lenses piqued my passion for bioethics, a synergy of biology, socio-cultural politics, and philosophy. I loved dissections and protein assays, compiling pieces of life's puzzle, but increasingly, I realized my research didn't function in a vacuum. Minutiae, including how we rationally perceive animals, does affect our human-to-human interactions, and the possibility that biology can be ethically improved as a discipline leads me to investigate potential solutions.The College of Arts and Science's Health and Societies major is, essentially, bioethics on steroids. It is one of the only programs I've found that shares my mission to unravel science's moral complexities. I ultimately aspire to be a genetic engineer, a trailblazer in healthcare. However, as the pioneer of gene-editing Jennifer Doudna warns in A Crack in Creation, it is a powerful profession that deserves deep contemplation.For instance, with parents soon being able to edit fetal traits such as autism or sexuality, I can't help but wonder if these efforts are inherently discriminatory. Perhaps, in Modern Biology and Social Implications or Darwin's Legacy, I'll discover some semblance of an answer. Analyzing current events with classmates, such as China's rogue designer-babies, is the best medium for me to examine innovation's social responsibilities. Meanwhile, studying historical Darwinistic theory is key to understanding modern ableism and homophobia. I hope to lob philosophical questions across the room, engage in existential discussions, then translate theory into practice by interning with the Bucan Lab. On the forefront of studying behavioral genetics, I can not only witness firsthand autism research, but also start bioethical conversations with colleagues. I'd like to ask Professor Bucan the safety of gene-editing: how do we ensure altering particular genes won't have any harmful off-target effects?Beyond the University of Pennsylvania's individual opportunities is its commitment to fostering community. The course Culture, Production, and Consumption in the Global Marketplace best embodies this value. On one hand, I'm eager to discuss with peers how healthcare is shaped by consumerism, but on the other, I'd like to listen to their experiences of growing up in a contemporary, capitalistic society. Even better is that we can do all this while exploring Philadelphia, relishing the cuisine and museums of an international city.Furthermore, I dream to bring this element of collective discovery beyond campus. Whether it be the student-run Engineers Without Borders or the International Honors Programs' Health and Community initiative, the University of Pennsylvania's support for worldly scholarship is inspiring. Meshing ethics, bioengineering, and sociology to address global health challenges livens my curiosities, and I seek to investigate how healthcare functions in different sociocultural contexts abroad, specifically its inclusion and exclusion of certain populations. These experiences all contribute to my Health and Societies' senior capstone project: I yearn to unite my extracurriculars and academics by focusing on worldwide queer mental health disparities and possible medical solutions.Biological innovations, such as genetic engineering, address many of our woes, but with new developments comes new moral concerns. More and more, science intersects with philosophy, politics, and culture, and I value majoring in Health and Societies to be conscientious of these crossroads. The University of Pennsylvania's thoughtful and interdisciplinary landscape, thus, beckons me. I dream to join its haven for intellectual reflection, delve into the nuances of scientific advancements, and maybe\\u2014if time permits\\u2014get back to answering the question to kill or not to kill.How will you explore your intellectual and academic interests at the University of Pennsylvania? Please answer this question given the specific undergraduate school to which you are applying. (400-650 words) Sustainability. A gardener myself, I'm already enamored by Dartmouth's camaraderie with nature. Whether it be bee-keeping with classmates or relaxing in the organic farm alone, each facet of campus is a chance to humble myself, to reaffirm my appreciation for Earth.This self-effacing curiosity pervades Dartmouth's D-Plan. If I'm going to be studying tropical-biology, I'm joining a foreign-study program to gather real samples in Caribbean reefs. If I want to grasp science's role in society, I'm using my sophomore summer to debate peers in Ethics and Information Technology. Dartmouth ultimately fosters a sustainable education: time and learning are never wasted.While arguing a Dartmouth-related case before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1818, Daniel Webster, Class of 1801, delivered this memorable line: 'It is, Sir\\u2026a small college. And yet, there are those who love it!' As you seek admission to the Class of 2023, what aspects of the College's program, community or campus environment attract your interest?Jane was commended for being a survivor.Clad in invisible armor, defiant against injustice\\u2014that's how we imagined her as her story of sexual assault circulated. We deemed her a hero, nearing superhuman, but\\u2014as Jane would confide in me later\\u2014not once did our hasty label reflect her struggles honestly.To her, survivor implied that the worst was over, sidelining her depression for a more palatable story of overcoming. Our words weren't ill-intentioned, but certainly, they were ill-informed. I realized we succumbed to a grander cultural problem\\u2014one that sentimentalizes and misrepresents sexual assault, discouraging reporting and de-prioritizing long-term care.From volunteering in a rape-counseling center, I've grasped that shaping culture begins with shaping language. Similar to how normalizing gender-neutral pronouns promotes acceptance, how we describe assault must be more inclusive. By exploring Dartmouth's interdisciplinary courses United States of Queer and Inequality and Social Justice, I desire to interrogate with classmates the reforms activism needs to encompass all narratives.Subsequently, under the Student and Presidential Committee on Sexual Assault, I seek to translate theory into justice. Joining peers will not only offer me a platform to cultivate student-administration dialogue, but also resources to pursue solutions for sexual assault's psychological consequences. With an Elizabeth A. Hoffman Research Grant, I can investigate the strengths of differing therapy techniques at Dartmouth's National Center for PTSD, later bringing my findings to the table for debate. How should we improve existing campus mental-health support systems?Sexual assault shouldn't be a tokenized story or glorified narrative. Dartmouth's expressive, multifaceted community is a haven to foster this ideal, to devise the most holistic solutions for sexual violence. I strive to be a better ally for Jane and others, but first I must address our misguided words and assumptions. Therein, however, lies the beauty of language\\u2014only discussion rectifies it, not silence.In the aftermath of World War II, Dartmouth President John Sloane Dickey, Class of 1929, proclaimed, 'The world's troubles are your troubles\\u2026and there is nothing wrong with the world that better human beings cannot fix.' Which of the world's 'troubles' inspires you to act? How might your course of study at Dartmouth prepare you to address it?My love for collective adventures leads me to Duke. I've traversed Yosemite, scuba-dived with family, but none of these experiences even compare to the excitement of tenting with friends, braving the cold for a taste of athletic thrill. Between games, I'm eager to explore Duke's various social niches. The International Cooking Club shines in particular: I'm giddy to embrace my surrounding diversity and share my own Taiwanese recipes.This love for community extends into academics. As an aspiring cognitive-neurobiologist, the Lemur Center and its tight-knit team of interdisciplinary scientists uniquely appeals to me. Investigating primate biology is the best mechanism for medical research, much more efficient than mice-models. With my previous experience untangling developmental-genetics, I hope to contribute to the center's deciphering of neurodegenerative disease.Every facet of Duke is ultimately a collective adventure. Whether that be chanting Blue Devils! or observing lemurs, I know I'll always be at home.If you are applying to the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences as a first year applicant, please discuss why you consider Duke a good match for you. Is there something particular about Duke that attracts you? (Please limit your response to no more than 150 words.)Jane was commended for being a survivor.Clad in invisible armor and defiant against injustice\\u2014that's how we imagined her as her story of sexual assault circulated. We deemed her a hero, nearing superhuman, but\\u2014as Jane would confide in me later\\u2014not once did our hasty label reflect her struggles honestly.To her, survivor implied that the worst was over. It sidelined her depression for a more palatable story of overcoming. Our words weren't ill-intentioned, but certainly, they were ill-informed. Unknowingly, we succumbed to society's habit of misrepresenting sexual assault, fostering a claustrophobic environment hostile to truth.Some call it nitpicky political-correctness, but shaping culture must begin with shaping language. Survivor versus victim or gender-neutral pronouns seem insignificant, but from volunteering at the rape-counseling center, I've realized these minutiae do matter to vulnerable individuals in my community. Words legitimize our experiences, our identities, and when others abuse or mischaracterize us with them, shame arises. It's when my suffering and tears were once ridiculed as gay, when Jane's narrative was tokenized for public inspiration.For me, however, language's fluidity signifies hope. In my current project with Bay Area Women Against Rape, I embrace engaging law enforcement through creating awareness curriculum to re-evaluate how we address sexual assault. Instead of this what I think, it's what do you prefer?\\u2014words should be empathetic tools to empower people to express their own stories. To be a better ally for Jane, myself, and others, I find purpose in molding discourse. Thankfully, only discussion rectifies language, not silence.Duke University seeks a talented, engaged student body that embodies the wide range of human experience; we believe that the diversity of our students makes our community stronger. If you'd like to share a perspective you bring or experiences you've had to help us understand you better-perhaps related to a community you belong to or your family or cultural background-we encourage you to do so. Real people are reading your application, and we want to do our best to understand and appreciate the real people applying to Duke. \"\"\"\n",

    "text = \"\"\"His glittered hand reaches for mine, and I swiftly yank my arm back to avoid contact. Hurt momentarily clouds his eyes, but his excitement soon returns once he rejoins the chaos of the parade. As the surrounding clamor of drag queens and rainbow motorcycles drifts into my periphery, a desperate isolation overcomes me. This march is my community's grandest welcome party\\u2014the epitome of acceptance\\u2014yet why do I feel like an excluded spectator? Shouldn't my rainbow flag also be fluttering in the air, not neatly furled beneath my jacket?My gnawing guilt feels all too familiar. It's what I first experienced when I spotted Jethro, then a freshman, in the school parking lot. While half of me basked in awe of his high heels and rainbow bandana, my other half suffered a creeping discomfort. Dad, expectedly, only expressed the latter.'Look, I know you're different too...but you're not that different right?''No, of course not.''Good.'As having just come out as gay, that fleeting conversation warped my self-perception. It solidified an arbitrary line between acceptable and detestable, leading me struggling to display idealized teenage masculinity. Instead of culinary documentaries, football. Gardening and watercolors became hobbies of history. I knew I succumbed to internalized homophobia, but conformity provided security. I preferred feeling confused and deprived to facing any negativity from expressing myself candidly.Thankfully, Jethro entered my life again\\u2014this time on Instagram, where he passionately rebuked discriminatory comments. I attempted a facade of indifference, but subconsciously I resonated with his vulnerability and\\u2014surprisingly\\u2014courage. When he concluded with 'We have nothing to be sorry for,' I actually started to believe it.That millisecond of empowerment slowly became a feeling I craved. Thus, I ventured into the world of activism, but since my initial anxieties lingered, I remained anonymous. Through storytelling, I connected with others who confronted similar difficulties, writing and sharing blog posts about my social experiences. When my city back-lashed against California's new LGBTQ+-inclusive sexual education curriculum, I interviewed dozens of students on identity to compile their voices into a magazine, weaving together narratives of mental health, sexuality, and self-acceptance. Did it obliterate homophobia? No. But it certainly revealed perspectives that had been suppressed for too long. I was honestly proud of my project, yet I still obscured my name and story due to fear.The blare of horns drags me back to the present, and suddenly, I realize this march might be my final chance to escape hypocrisy and reclaim my activism. I urge others to live freely, but how can I do so when I shudder at the thought of being recognized with a rainbow flag?Here and now, I must accept that being gay does define me. Not as being predisposed to enjoy art and horticulture, but through my journey towards self-acceptance, I have gained a refined sensitivity to the struggles of others. I listen, I understand, and when others are lost, I extend my own experiences to empathize with their hardships. These qualities all contribute to my ability to tell compelling stories, a cornerstone of activism, but detached from their authors, stories are just hollow words. To truly empower others in the future, especially those in silence like I was, I can't shy away from the spotlight. I must let all my readers know that I am a tangible individual who is unashamed to exude my story truthfully.Before releasing my first real 'About Me' blog post, I unzip my jacket and reveal my flag. Uplifted by my thrill of starting a new chapter, my arm reaches higher into the canopy of confetti, and I stare wondrously at the colors rippling above. Finally, I feel no more doubt and no more fear: I break free from the sidelines and joyously clasp the next hand offered.I am a staunch opponent of the belief 'Stick to your passions early.' At best, this advice is idealistic, and at worst, it limits exploration. When I first volunteered as a science instructor at a local elementary school, this dogma was rampant, rigidifying curriculum and intimidating students.As cofounder and Director of Outreach of the non-profit organization Stemnova, I sought to eliminate the walls that suffocated STEM education. By our second year, I grew ambitious. I was determined to take steps to reinvent local perceptions of science bigger than the small fundraisers and science nights we had organized before.Thus, Stemnova partnered with the state Science Olympiad organization to host the first student-run tournament on the West Coast. Although our mission was daunting, I knew it was key to proving to our community that science is not compartmentalized. The competition committee I organized creatively planned each event down to the finest detail. For epidemiology, we incorporated novel computer models; for chemistry, we devised labs inspired by botany and nutritional sciences, and for experimental design, we blended together physics and biology. Each minute of the tournament was a sacred chance to exhibit the applicability and interdisciplinary nature of science.By the invitational's end, it was evident our purpose reached the students - at least half their questions for our professional guest speakers linked together various scientific fields. Though some parents still seemed confused, I was content that we had influenced the minds that mattered the most. The awards ceremony was an revelatory moment. Not only did I recognize the current impacts of my leadership, but I also began to envision what my innovative potential could bring in the future - an unbounded educational landscape. I felt empowered by both the students' excitement and my volunteers' own devotions to materializing something we had initially struggled to define. Our competition was a first for many, and I am still proud of myself and my team for devising an experience that broadened the next generation's understandings and encouraged their once suppressed desire to explore.Like an unscratchable itch, the Finite Heartbeat Theory tugs constantly at my curiosities. Its hypothesis is simple - we have a predetermined number of heartbeats. When my half-pseudoscientist, half-biology teacher first exclaimed this to our class years ago, my seventh-grade self believed it wholeheartedly.By ninth grade, I feared the heart. With Grandpa passing away from a heart attack and my teacher's words still echoing in my head, I viewed the heart as a ticking time bomb. From my apprehension, however, spawned a cautious interest towards cardiology: I was perpetually haunted by the question 'How many heartbeats left?'My concerns brought me into the Priest Laboratory for Pediatric Cardiology through the Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer Research Program. Hoping to characterize diabetes' effects on prenatal heart development, I dissected fetal hearts and submerged them in toxic, diabetic conditions overnight.The next morning, as I examined the petri dish with a microscope, I could barely grapple with what I saw - the hearts still beat, oblivious to their caustic surroundings. What I once perceived as a doomed organ suddenly transformed into a vessel of resilience. Before, my interest in cardiology was rooted in foreboding, but, now, it stemmed from a newfound appreciation for the heart's endurance despite adversary. My epiphany spawned fresh queries and perspectives. As I reminisced my Grandpa's own passing, I refused to anxiously calculate how many heartbeats he used. Instead, I began to inquire how I could better the lives of my parents, remembering my own father's cardiovascular disease.These questions led me to where I am today, researching pediatric cardiology in the Priest Lab and observing cardiac stem cell therapy in the Wu Lab. Every day, my work, from cultivating cells to evaluating genetic data, is inspired by my faith in the heart's tenacity, and through pursuing cardiology, I have sharpened my experimental acumen and diversified my scientific skillset. Occasionally, I still ponder over the truth of the Finite Heartbeat Theory, but I always arrive at the same conclusion - with limited heartbeats, I better seize opportunity now and fully dedicate myself to understanding the heart's complexity.Since childhood, I have always been fascinated with the Wubble Bubble. It was simple yet entertaining - its tinted surface humorously distorting my friend's whispers as they floated through the ball to my ear. While my Wubble Bubble now remains deflated in my garage, my fascination with bubbles is still very much afloat. Fortunately - or unfortunately as I have come to recognize - I don't have to look far to find one. In fact, I live in one.In middle school, I loved my Bay Area bubble, grateful that it shielded my community's pride parades and cultural celebrations. However, I grew complacent despite the emerging discrimination in our communities. In early 2018 when California released a more progressive sexual education curriculum, I was snapped out of this illusion. Watching the school board meeting livestream, with its homophobic undertones and disregard for mental health, shocked me. That night, I felt anxious yet impassioned. Being gay myself, I was terrified at the thought of being an outcast, but, simultaneously, I was angry that my identity was considered 'inappropriate' to share. A newfound fervor subsequently overtook me, and with my yearbook experience and the design talent of my friend, I sought to create a magazine to highlight the neglected voices of Fremont's youth. We originally intended to only focus on sexuality, but soon after interviewing dozens of students, we broadened our project to illuminate stories of body positivity, depression, stress, and abusive relationships. Titled 'Miscellany,' our magazine both distributed overlooked narratives to an audience and served as an outlet for emotional release for its contributors. It fostered empathy as it circulated in classrooms and homes, and I am still inspired by accounts from my closest friend's brother that less and less students at his elementary school are using once-prevalent homophobic language.Today, frankly, I am not sure how many individuals have flipped through my magazine - maybe hundreds, perhaps thousands. But I do know that even if only one person reads one story, that is still an important step towards spotlighting shrouded perspectives and solidifying the foundations for a more accepting Fremont.The first time I ever heard a recording of my debate speech, it was torture. It was less what I said, but more how I said it. My voice, both nasal and high-pitched, was excruciating to the ear, and immediately, what I once overlooked bolted to the forefront of my insecurities.In high school, with everyone changing, my distinct voice brought along with it belittling stereotypes: each 'What's up with you high voice?' and 'Your voice is gay' cornered me into silence and isolation. Competing in debate only amplified my anxiety, so futilely, I practiced diaphragm stretches and speaking exercises to deepen my voice. These activities were distractions from reading and developing cases, but I committed to them anyway, leading to a tragic string of losses.Junior year, before a national tournament, my voice disappeared. Sounding like a whelping animal during my vocal exercises, my fear quickly evolved into resignation. Since I couldn't speak, I spent my night determinedly researching instead, half hoping that maybe I could win on the premise of knowledge.That weekend, even with my relentless coughing, my partner and I advanced into the top thirty-two. Though we received just a flimsy certificate, it meant so much more to me as it was the first tangible evidence that challenged my insecurities. While my fingers ran along the paper, I realized what had distinguished this tournament was that I had actually focused on something changeable - my knowledge - instead of a constant factor. Before, my self-consciousness blinded me from spotting any actual opportunities for growth.Today, my voice is a reminder of my own resilience and adaptability. From this struggle, I have come to grasp the importance of perspective in learning, that I should focus on malleable factors to propel myself forward. This process of overcoming my linear thinking has influenced me to constantly reevaluate my problems and identify affectable areas of improvement: self-improvement is only achievable through reason and passion. Now, I am no longer concerned about my voice. Instead, I am driven to use it as a powerful tool to better engage my curiosities.\"},{\"index\":1,\"personal_essay\":\"To kill or not to kill is a question that has taunted me since June. Where my inner biologist yearned to dissect all the mice in the world (for science, of course), my inner ethicist questioned my sacrifices' purposes. After all, these were living creatures in my hands: what set them so apart from me that justified their role as test subjects?From perusing Peter Singer's Animal Liberation to attending cardiology conferences, answering the same concern from various lenses piqued my passion for bioethics, a synergy of biology, socio-cultural politics, and philosophy. I loved dissections and protein assays, compiling pieces of life's puzzle, but increasingly, I realized my research didn't function in a vacuum. Minutiae, including how we rationally perceive animals, does affect our human-to-human interactions, and the possibility that biology can be ethically improved as a discipline leads me to investigate potential solutions.The College of Arts and Science's Health and Societies major is, essentially, bioethics on steroids. It is one of the only programs I've found that shares my mission to unravel science's moral complexities. I ultimately aspire to be a genetic engineer, a trailblazer in healthcare. However, as the pioneer of gene-editing Jennifer Doudna warns in A Crack in Creation, it is a powerful profession that deserves deep contemplation.For instance, with parents soon being able to edit fetal traits such as autism or sexuality, I can't help but wonder if these efforts are inherently discriminatory. Perhaps, in Modern Biology and Social Implications or Darwin's Legacy, I'll discover some semblance of an answer. Analyzing current events with classmates, such as China's rogue designer-babies, is the best medium for me to examine innovation's social responsibilities. Meanwhile, studying historical Darwinistic theory is key to understanding modern ableism and homophobia. I hope to lob philosophical questions across the room, engage in existential discussions, then translate theory into practice by interning with the Bucan Lab. On the forefront of studying behavioral genetics, I can not only witness firsthand autism research, but also start bioethical conversations with colleagues. I'd like to ask Professor Bucan the safety of gene-editing: how do we ensure altering particular genes won't have any harmful off-target effects?Beyond the University of Pennsylvania's individual opportunities is its commitment to fostering community. The course Culture, Production, and Consumption in the Global Marketplace best embodies this value. On one hand, I'm eager to discuss with peers how healthcare is shaped by consumerism, but on the other, I'd like to listen to their experiences of growing up in a contemporary, capitalistic society. Even better is that we can do all this while exploring Philadelphia, relishing the cuisine and museums of an international city.Furthermore, I dream to bring this element of collective discovery beyond campus. Whether it be the student-run Engineers Without Borders or the International Honors Programs' Health and Community initiative, the University of Pennsylvania's support for worldly scholarship is inspiring. Meshing ethics, bioengineering, and sociology to address global health challenges livens my curiosities, and I seek to investigate how healthcare functions in different sociocultural contexts abroad, specifically its inclusion and exclusion of certain populations. These experiences all contribute to my Health and Societies' senior capstone project: I yearn to unite my extracurriculars and academics by focusing on worldwide queer mental health disparities and possible medical solutions.Biological innovations, such as genetic engineering, address many of our woes, but with new developments comes new moral concerns. More and more, science intersects with philosophy, politics, and culture, and I value majoring in Health and Societies to be conscientious of these crossroads. The University of Pennsylvania's thoughtful and interdisciplinary landscape, thus, beckons me. I dream to join its haven for intellectual reflection, delve into the nuances of scientific advancements, and maybe\\u2014if time permits\\u2014get back to answering the question to kill or not to kill.How will you explore your intellectual and academic interests at the University of Pennsylvania? Please answer this question given the specific undergraduate school to which you are applying. (400-650 words) Sustainability. A gardener myself, I'm already enamored by Dartmouth's camaraderie with nature. Whether it be bee-keeping with classmates or relaxing in the organic farm alone, each facet of campus is a chance to humble myself, to reaffirm my appreciation for Earth.This self-effacing curiosity pervades Dartmouth's D-Plan. If I'm going to be studying tropical-biology, I'm joining a foreign-study program to gather real samples in Caribbean reefs. If I want to grasp science's role in society, I'm using my sophomore summer to debate peers in Ethics and Information Technology. Dartmouth ultimately fosters a sustainable education: time and learning are never wasted.While arguing a Dartmouth-related case before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1818, Daniel Webster, Class of 1801, delivered this memorable line: 'It is, Sir\\u2026a small college. And yet, there are those who love it!' As you seek admission to the Class of 2023, what aspects of the College's program, community or campus environment attract your interest?Jane was commended for being a survivor.Clad in invisible armor, defiant against injustice\\u2014that's how we imagined her as her story of sexual assault circulated. We deemed her a hero, nearing superhuman, but\\u2014as Jane would confide in me later\\u2014not once did our hasty label reflect her struggles honestly.To her, survivor implied that the worst was over, sidelining her depression for a more palatable story of overcoming. Our words weren't ill-intentioned, but certainly, they were ill-informed. I realized we succumbed to a grander cultural problem\\u2014one that sentimentalizes and misrepresents sexual assault, discouraging reporting and de-prioritizing long-term care.From volunteering in a rape-counseling center, I've grasped that shaping culture begins with shaping language. Similar to how normalizing gender-neutral pronouns promotes acceptance, how we describe assault must be more inclusive. By exploring Dartmouth's interdisciplinary courses United States of Queer and Inequality and Social Justice, I desire to interrogate with classmates the reforms activism needs to encompass all narratives.Subsequently, under the Student and Presidential Committee on Sexual Assault, I seek to translate theory into justice. Joining peers will not only offer me a platform to cultivate student-administration dialogue, but also resources to pursue solutions for sexual assault's psychological consequences. With an Elizabeth A. Hoffman Research Grant, I can investigate the strengths of differing therapy techniques at Dartmouth's National Center for PTSD, later bringing my findings to the table for debate. How should we improve existing campus mental-health support systems?Sexual assault shouldn't be a tokenized story or glorified narrative. Dartmouth's expressive, multifaceted community is a haven to foster this ideal, to devise the most holistic solutions for sexual violence. I strive to be a better ally for Jane and others, but first I must address our misguided words and assumptions. Therein, however, lies the beauty of language\\u2014only discussion rectifies it, not silence.In the aftermath of World War II, Dartmouth President John Sloane Dickey, Class of 1929, proclaimed, 'The world's troubles are your troubles\\u2026and there is nothing wrong with the world that better human beings cannot fix.' Which of the world's 'troubles' inspires you to act? How might your course of study at Dartmouth prepare you to address it?My love for collective adventures leads me to Duke. I've traversed Yosemite, scuba-dived with family, but none of these experiences even compare to the excitement of tenting with friends, braving the cold for a taste of athletic thrill. Between games, I'm eager to explore Duke's various social niches. The International Cooking Club shines in particular: I'm giddy to embrace my surrounding diversity and share my own Taiwanese recipes.This love for community extends into academics. As an aspiring cognitive-neurobiologist, the Lemur Center and its tight-knit team of interdisciplinary scientists uniquely appeals to me. Investigating primate biology is the best mechanism for medical research, much more efficient than mice-models. With my previous experience untangling developmental-genetics, I hope to contribute to the center's deciphering of neurodegenerative disease.Every facet of Duke is ultimately a collective adventure. Whether that be chanting Blue Devils! or observing lemurs, I know I'll always be at home.If you are applying to the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences as a first year applicant, please discuss why you consider Duke a good match for you. Is there something particular about Duke that attracts you? (Please limit your response to no more than 150 words.)Jane was commended for being a survivor.Clad in invisible armor and defiant against injustice\\u2014that's how we imagined her as her story of sexual assault circulated. We deemed her a hero, nearing superhuman, but\\u2014as Jane would confide in me later\\u2014not once did our hasty label reflect her struggles honestly.To her, survivor implied that the worst was over. It sidelined her depression for a more palatable story of overcoming. Our words weren't ill-intentioned, but certainly, they were ill-informed. Unknowingly, we succumbed to society's habit of misrepresenting sexual assault, fostering a claustrophobic environment hostile to truth.Some call it nitpicky political-correctness, but shaping culture must begin with shaping language. Survivor versus victim or gender-neutral pronouns seem insignificant, but from volunteering at the rape-counseling center, I've realized these minutiae do matter to vulnerable individuals in my community. Words legitimize our experiences, our identities, and when others abuse or mischaracterize us with them, shame arises. It's when my suffering and tears were once ridiculed as gay, when Jane's narrative was tokenized for public inspiration.For me, however, language's fluidity signifies hope. In my current project with Bay Area Women Against Rape, I embrace engaging law enforcement through creating awareness curriculum to re-evaluate how we address sexual assault. Instead of this what I think, it's what do you prefer?\\u2014words should be empathetic tools to empower people to express their own stories. To be a better ally for Jane, myself, and others, I find purpose in molding discourse. Thankfully, only discussion rectifies language, not silence.Duke University seeks a talented, engaged student body that embodies the wide range of human experience; we believe that the diversity of our students makes our community stronger. If you'd like to share a perspective you bring or experiences you've had to help us understand you better-perhaps related to a community you belong to or your family or cultural background-we encourage you to do so. Real people are reading your application, and we want to do our best to understand and appreciate the real people applying to Duke. \"\"\""

    "text = \"\"\"Physically, besides our Chinese complexion, there's one characteristic that has defined the Wei family: hair. Lots of it.I tie my bushy ponytail with two actual rubber bands, because normal hair-ties keep breaking\\u2014and still, it whacks my face when playing tennis. My brother never wears shorts on first dates, to hide his hairy legs. And since I was young, I've loved ruffling my mom's abundant hair.That changed my junior year, when my mom came home with her hair shaved off.I could barely recognize her. It was in that moment that the reality of her breast cancer hit me. I felt compelled to do anything to help her. To be strong for her. I held her close and somehow I knew we were going to be okay.Her cancer made me step up as a daughter. I did things for her out of love that I would have never done for myself. When her joints ached, I scoured the internet to find comfortable shoes for her. When she needed exercise but was too tired, I did leg lifts with her in bed.After a few cycles of chemo, my mom's blood counts were low. When she smelled her once-favorite foods, she wanted to throw up. But I knew she needed her nutrition. I asked the school's cooking teacher for recommendations. She gave me a whole cookbook of just soups, and I experimented at home with new flavors, ranging from minestrone to broccoli-cheddar, unusual to our Chinese cuisine. Mom's next blood test results showed her counts increased. I quit the tennis team to care for my mom. Tennis had been my first identity in high school. It shaped my work ethic and taught me resilience in the face of hard losses. But during tennis season, when my mom went through her toughest chemotherapy sessions, I knew I had to be there for her. In a way, tennis was an artificial environment to practice for the real challenges of life. I saw more powerful ways to use what the sport had taught me. My mom needed me more than my team did, and I needed more time with her.Mom's cancer taught me that each moment was important. I'll remember planting kisses on my mom's face as I tucked her into bed. I'll remember cleaning up her vomit with my dad in the small bathroom, working together with gloved hands. I'll remember telling a classmate about my mom's cancer, and her response: 'I haven't told anyone. I have leukemia. Now I realize I'm not alone.' Through laughter and conversations about family struggles, hospital visits, and favorite songs, we made a deep connection. I realized that there were important moments not just with family, but also with the people around me. I wanted to appreciate them all.As a journalist, I hoped to make moments important for others too. Where the boys basketball team saw their usual post-game meeting in the locker room, I saw a story of how a team became a family. Where a math teacher didn't think twice about his doodling, I saw a hidden talent worth featuring. I found so much inspiration in learning about what made people uniquely themselves: their stories, ideas, opinions. I wanted to capture those unique stories of my school, for people to feel important and heard. I found my new identity, a student journalist: a listener who sees the world with curiosity, compassion and purpose\\u2014someone who helps empower others.This summer, I donated 9 inches of my ponytail. I imagine the strands bringing confidence to someone I'll never know. As I helped my mom pick out a wig to wear when returning to work, I saw small hairs beginning to grow. I saw resilience.As our hair grows, I will too. Smiling through challenges and learning from them. Appreciating the people around me. Making every moment important.When I saw the iconic photo of Alan Kurdi washed ashore, I cried. After class, I stayed behind with my friend Meghana, trying to grasp the complexities of the Syrian Refugee Crisis, wishing we could do something. Online, Meghana and I discovered Paper Airplanes: a non-profit that connects students with Syrian refugees to tutor. We established Lynbrook's chapter, inviting students to join through social media. Twenty committed to help.Through Paper Airplanes, I tutored a 17-year-old Syrian refugee living in Turkey, who wanted to take the TOEFL to attend college. Helping him grow from incomplete English sentences to his first essay filled me with pride. I wanted to be the best tutor possible for him, and I saw the other twenty tutors feel the same about their own students. But many were intimidated to teach English learners for the first time.I set out to help, reading education blogs and drawing from my experiences to create tutoring-workshops such as 'Spicing up Grammar Lessons' and 'Fun Writing Activities.' I also led discussions where we devised ways to improve lessons and empower our students. For example, Zahra's student spoke Arabic during lessons because she was afraid to make mistakes in English. Together, we discussed how to create a safe space so students felt comfortable.Initially, some tutors didn't quite understand the realities of the Syrian Refugee Crisis. When some students couldn't be reached due to their unstable lives, I encouraged them to use it as a learning opportunity to understand what being a refugee meant. This year, we've expanded our leadership team and number of tutors and plan to spread more awareness about refugee and immigrant rights through speaker events. It has been so fulfilling to see the growth in our tutors: not only have they gained confidence in their leadership abilities, but they've also formed lasting friendships with their students and personal connections to this global issue.The Syrian Refugee Crisis remains a daunting issue to solve, but I believe through education and empathy, we can make a meaningful difference and make the world feel more connected.My junior year, creative problem solving took on a new meaning for me when my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. To help with the challenges arising from her chemotherapy, I found solutions with creativity and love.Chemotherapy killed my mom's taste buds, and her once-favorite foods became difficult to swallow. I knew she needed her nutrition; I thought, if she were to try foods that she hasn't eaten before, she would have no prior expectation of their flavor, so she wouldn't be as disappointed. Every night, I would cook her different foods from different cuisines. I was ecstatic when she enjoyed them a lot more.However, another problem arose. A few hours after eating her meals, she would become nauseous and vomit her food, undigested. Her doctor told her this was normal. I knew vomiting was a side effect of chemotherapy, but I refused to accept that there was nothing I could do about it. Exercising, I thought, could be a possible solution. If she moved around, I thought, it could help my mom's body actively digest food. I knew this wouldn't solve the entire problem, but I hoped it would make a difference. So, I'd go on walks with my mom to encourage her to move around, and bought her new, comfortable shoes when her feet were swollen. As she had more chemo treatments, she became too tired to get out of bed. I created a workout for her to do in bed, consisting of leg lifts, crunches (with me holding down her legs), and arm circles \\u2014 all done without standing up. The exercise did help my mom's digestion. It also helped her in ways I didn't imagine: going on walks helped her calm her mind, and exercising together in bed gave us another way to bond together. An act of creativity not only brought a solution to a problem, but it also created happy memories. In taking care of my mom, I've learned to use creative problem solving to help others, and to face challenges with positivity and resilience.I'm fascinated by the interdisciplinary potential of computer science. Beyond data structures and algorithms, it's about solving problems creatively.When I entered high school, I started teaching myself through MIT's OpenCourseWare, working my way through problem sets with Python. In sophomore year, I took C++ courses at Foothill College. In addition to teaching me about object-oriented programming and pointers, my professor introduced me to the 3 P's: Patience, Practice, and Perseverance. Today, I strive to use the 3 P's in everything I do.My junior year, I realized technology could positively impact the way our school newspaper told stories, making them more compelling and accessible. As a student journalist, I saw that our community was filled with powerful stories that couldn't fit in a monthly paper. So, I decided to build a website to put our stories online. The website increased our viewership, allowing parents and alumni to engage with our stories. When several staffers wrote online stories relating to the #MeToo movement, I compiled the stories together and coded our publication's first multimedia package. It was an unique way our audience could experience a story, and I want to continue combining code and journalism to present powerful stories: from analyzing data for investigative stories to creating multimedia projects. When my mom's breast cancer was diagnosed after she experienced symptoms, I wondered whether a machine-learning-based model could have detected her cancer during an annual mammogram months earlier, instead. I immersed myself in neural networks, activation and loss functions, weights and biases, pulling together Python libraries to create a model that can recognize breast cancer in mammograms. I was so excited when, uploading my mom's mammogram to the model, I watched it circle her cancer's location in red. I hope to continue this research in other fields, finding meaning of the world's piles of data.Computer science is more than an academic subject: it's a way to search for new solutions, to expand possibilities. I want to study both computer science and the humanities to tell compelling stories as a journalist and better solve problems that impact the people around me.As a student journalist, I've learned that every person has a meaningful story to tell. Sharing and listening to stories can make us more open-minded, compassionate, and understanding of the people and the world around us. I seek out the stories of others, listening and sharing them with compassion.Stories bring awareness and create tangible change. My co-editor and I filmed a documentary on the wave of youth activism following the Parkland shooting to capture this movement for our community; at our first screening, we distributed voter-registration forms. When I collected data on students' experiences with bullying for a feature, the principal shared it at an all-staff meeting about school culture. I wrote an editorial that brought attention to the school's lack of emergency preparedness; the following school year, administrators conducted a Run, Hide, Defend drill. I interviewed a student at our school, who showed me how one person's courage to speak out can spark a movement. He told me about his loneliness and depression, which led to drug use and an intentional overdose his senior year. He wanted others to hear his story: to break the stigma around mental health in our community, to help others realize they're not alone, to spread hope and positivity. I spent countless hours writing the story, knowing I had to do it justice. I hoped it could inspire others the same way it inspired me. The story created a ripple effect. Our newspaper's online traffic tripled, surpassing 1,200 views for the first time. At our school, mental health issues are apparent, but rarely talked about. The story led to students having more open conversations about mental health. A teacher said it reminded him of why he became a teacher. A parent translated the article into Chinese and shared it in a group-chat with hundreds of parents, where they discussed how to address mental health with their own children.Stories acknowledge the voices of individuals, bringing the community together. I want to use journalism to make people feel heard, to empower others to share their voices and to inspire positive change.Although I joined the school newspaper on a whim and had previously planned to take AP Computer Science, journalism has become a core part of the person I am today. To me, journalism is a way to see the world with curiosity and compassion. Everyone has a story, and journalism allows me to hear those stories \\u2014 to learn more about the people around me and be inspired by them. Journalism tells people, 'Your story matters,' and I want to be someone who helps the community by showing people that their voices are important. I also love the fast-paced nature of journalism, how it pushes me to tap into abilities I never knew I had, like produce a high-quality story on a tight deadline.Journalism has taught me to experience the world with an open mind, to soak every moment in \\u2014 because wherever you go, there's an exciting story.It's Tuesday lunch. My club officers and I begin with a presentation about spicing up grammar lessons for English learners. Then, the classroom lights up with discussion, each tutor sharing about their student. 'He's so motivated!' says Sanjana, describing her 17-year-old student who wants to fight for peace in Syria. Zahra poses a question; her student from Saudi Arabia speaks Arabic during lessons because she is afraid to make mistakes in English. 'What do you guys think I should do?'Together, our group come up with ways to help her student feel more comfortable during the online tutoring sessions.Two years ago, near the end of my sophomore year, this community of 30 people was only 3: my history teacher, my classmate, and me. Our world history teacher opened my eyes to the Syrian Refugee Crisis and the political, economic, and social factors that made it so difficult to solve. My classmate and I would stay in her classroom after school just talking about it, wishing there was something we could do.Then, I learned about Paper Airplanes \\u2014 an organization that connects English-speaking students with same-aged Syrian refugees to tutor. I told my friend about it, and last year we implemented it at Lynbrook. Through tutoring, we've learned to become better communicators and realized that, despite our students' varied life experiences, we're still the same: teenagers with big dreams who just want to have fun.When I see a new club member begin tutoring, I'm filled with hope and excitement for them, eager to help them learn more about the world and make a new friend. This community shares a love for education, helping others, and immersing ourselves in world issues, trying to make a difference, instead of turning a blind eye to problems too difficult to solve.Why that College or School?Computer science isn't just writing code to create a project; it's a way of assessing problems and devising solutions for them. This way of thinking \\u2014 of breaking large problems into smaller, manageable pieces that can be solved by teams of people, of constantly coming up with ways to improve \\u2014 can be applied to so many fields, from medicine to education to journalism.At the University of Michigan, I hope to double major in computer science and communications to create systems that allow the stories we share to have a wider impact. Last year, I created a website for our school newspaper because I wanted to tell more stories than could fit in a monthly 16-page paper. I realized that technology can bring a story to life in exciting ways. From multimedia projects to data analysis and visualization, technology allows stories to leave an even larger impact on audiences and can be used to create lasting change. It empowers people to share their voices. That's what technology should be about: empowering others. I want to be someone who can use her technical skills to empower other people to share their stories and show them that their voices matter.I'm ecstatic that the University of Michigan provides such a thorough curriculum to explore these ideas. Courses such as EECS 554, Introduction to Digital Communication and Coding, would help me build platforms that innovate the way people share stories: allow them to reach more people and expand the potential of multimedia. COMM 495, Future of Digital Media, would connect me with peers who also aspire to bring communities together with technology and stories, and together we could come up with new ways to do so.Moreover, I hope to be part of The Michigan Daily staff to incorporate my love for computer science and journalism to share the stories of the people around me, through gathering data for investigative projects and using web and multimedia tools to immerse an audience into a story.I want to study at the University of Michigan because of how much the school embraces the idea of 'interdisciplinary.' I want to attend a school that embraces such a philosophy because computer science and communications are inherently interdisciplinary; computer science is applicable to so many fields and stories can be told about any subject and any person. I hope to minor, if not take classes in, urban studies and crime & justice to help me better understand the communities I want to serve after graduating. Taking classes as part of Michigan's data science major will give me the skills needed to pursue data journalism, a way to tell powerful stories with both numbers and words that can contribute to even more impactful investigative reporting.As a student, I hope to learn more about my community by immersing myself in it and giving back through programs such as the Prison Creative Arts Project.University of Michigan's focus on 'it's not just a major' and community outreach excites me because I will get to learn about the world in an interdisciplinary way and see the issues I care about through multiple perspectives.Idea or experience that makes you excited about learningI stared at Big Hero 6 on the screen, a substitute teacher's attempt to control a class of 8th graders. Fascinated by futuristic San Fransokyo, I fell in love with Baymax and the way he could help others\\u2014with super strength and knowledge about every medical procedure. That day I knew I wanted to learn computer science: to push possibilities like Tadashi, Baymax's designer, to create something to help people in ways never before imagined.When my mom was diagnosed with cancer, I wondered whether machine learning could have detected her cancer during an annual mammogram, instead of months later, after she felt symptoms. I had to find an answer.I immersed myself in this new world of neural networks, activation and loss functions, weights, and biases. The articles at first felt like reading a foreign language, pushing me to further understand those concepts. I was thrilled, in that moment when all the calculus concepts I learned in class clicked together with the project, and I rushed to explain it to my mom and brother.After pulling together Python libraries and making my own model, I was ecstatic when I uploaded my mom's mammogram and saw it circle the location of her cancer in red.I want to apply this research to other fields such as education and journalism, using the potential of machine learning to find meaning in the piles of data in the world. The future is now. And I can be a part of creating it.Note to future roommateDear Roommate,To me, mornings and nights are special, and I'm so excited to share these times of the day with you!

From multimedia projects to data analysis and visualization, technology allows stories to leave an even larger impact on audiences and can be used to create lasting change. It empowers people to share their voices. That's what technology should be about: empowering others. I want to be someone who can use her technical skills to empower other people to share their stories and show them that their voices matter.I'm ecstatic that the University of Michigan provides such a thorough curriculum to explore these ideas. Courses such as EECS 554, Introduction to Digital Communication and Coding, would help me build platforms that innovate the way people share stories: allow them to reach more people and expand the potential of multimedia. COMM 495, Future of Digital Media, would connect me with peers who also aspire to bring communities together with technology and stories, and together we could come up with new ways to do so.Moreover, I hope to be part of The Michigan Daily staff to incorporate my love for computer science and journalism to share the stories of the people around me, through gathering data for investigative projects and using web and multimedia tools to immerse an audience into a story.I want to study at the University of Michigan because of how much the school embraces the idea of 'interdisciplinary.' I want to attend a school that embraces such a philosophy because computer science and communications are inherently interdisciplinary; computer science is applicable to so many fields and stories can be told about any subject and any person. I hope to minor, if not take classes in, urban studies and crime & justice to help me better understand the communities I want to serve after graduating. Taking classes as part of Michigan's data science major will give me the skills needed to pursue data journalism, a way to tell powerful stories with both numbers and words that can contribute to even more impactful investigative reporting.As a student, I hope to learn more about my community by immersing myself in it and giving back through programs such as the Prison Creative Arts Project.University of Michigan's focus on 'it's not just a major' and community outreach excites me because I will get to learn about the world in an interdisciplinary way and see the issues I care about through multiple perspectives.Describe the unique qualities that attract you to the specific undergraduate College or School (including preferred admission and dual degree programs) to which you are applying at the University of Michigan. How would that curriculum support your interests?'I overdosed on purpose,' he said, 'When I woke up in the hospital, I saw my mom crying next to me. I finally realized life is worth living.'I sat next to him, listening intently. In that moment, there was no one more important. He told me about his struggles with depression, the loneliness he felt when others judged him. His words reminded me that every person is a world in itself, wrapped in stories, experiences, and emotions, that, when shared with another person, gives them a new perspective. His world affirmed the importance of empathy and compassion.My duty now was to do his story justice. I owed it to him, who wanted it told. If the story could help one person, it would have been worth it.After I published his story, a ripple effect started. A teacher said he was reminded of why he became a teacher. A parent translated the story into Chinese; online, it sparked a conversation about mental health among hundreds of parents who often shied away from the topic. He showed me the power one story has to spark a movement.I'll forever carry his story with me. I'll forever carry the stories of every person I've had the honor to listen to.

      "Through laughter and conversations about family struggles, hospital visits, and favorite songs, we made a deep connection.\n",
      "I realized that there were important moments not just with family, but also with the people around me.\n",
      "I wanted to appreciate them all.\n",
      "As a journalist, I hoped to make moments important for others too.\n",
      "Where the boys basketball team saw their usual post-game meeting in the locker room, I saw a story of how a team became a family.\n",
      "Where a math teacher didn't think twice about his doodling, I saw a hidden talent worth featuring.\n",

      "After class, I stayed behind with my friend Meghana, trying to grasp the complexities of the Syrian Refugee Crisis, wishing we could do something.\n",
      "Online, Meghana and I discovered Paper Airplanes: a non-profit that connects students with Syrian refugees to tutor.\n",
      "We established Lynbrook's chapter, inviting students to join through social media.\n",
      "Twenty committed to help.\n",
      "Through Paper Airplanes, I tutored a 17-year-old Syrian refugee living in Turkey, who wanted to take the TOEFL to attend college.\n",
      "Helping him grow from incomplete English sentences to his first essay filled me with pride.\n",
      "I wanted to be the best tutor possible for him, and I saw the other twenty tutors feel the same about their own students.\n",
      "But many were intimidated to teach English learners for the first time.\n",
      "I set out to help, reading education blogs and drawing from my experiences to create tutoring-workshops such as 'Spicing up Grammar Lessons' and 'Fun Writing Activities.'\n",
      "I also led discussions where we devised ways to improve lessons and empower our students.\n",
      "For example, Zahra's student spoke Arabic during lessons because she was afraid to make mistakes in English.\n",
      "Together, we discussed how to create a safe space so students felt comfortable.\n",
      "Initially, some tutors didn't quite understand the realities of the Syrian Refugee Crisis.\n",
      "When some students couldn't be reached due to their unstable lives, I encouraged them to use it as a learning opportunity to understand what being a refugee meant.\n",
      "This year, we've expanded our leadership team and number of tutors and plan to spread more awareness about refugee and immigrant rights through speaker events.\n",
      "It has been so fulfilling to see the growth in our tutors: not only have they gained confidence in their leadership abilities, but they've also formed lasting friendships with their students and personal connections to this global issue.\n",
      "The Syrian Refugee Crisis remains a daunting issue to solve, but I believe through education and empathy, we can make a meaningful difference and make the world feel more connected.\n",
      "My junior year, creative problem solving took on a new meaning for me when my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n",
      "To help with the challenges arising from her chemotherapy, I found solutions with creativity and love.\n",
      "Chemotherapy killed my mom's taste buds, and her once-favorite foods became difficult to swallow.\n",
      "I knew she needed her nutrition; I thought, if she were to try foods that she hasn't eaten before, she would have no prior expectation of their flavor, so she wouldn't be as disappointed.\n",
      "Every night, I would cook her different foods from different cuisines.\n",
      "I was ecstatic when she enjoyed them a lot more.\n",
      "However, another problem arose.\n",
      "A few hours after eating her meals, she would become nauseous and vomit her food, undigested.\n",
      "Her doctor told her this was normal.\n",
      "I knew vomiting was a side effect of chemotherapy, but I refused to accept that there was nothing I could do about it.\n",
      "Exercising, I thought, could be a possible solution.\n",
      "If she moved around, I thought, it could help my mom's body actively digest food.\n",
      "I knew this wouldn't solve the entire problem, but I hoped it would make a difference.\n",
      "So, I'd go on walks with my mom to encourage her to move around, and bought her new, comfortable shoes when her feet were swollen.\n",
      "As she had more chemo treatments, she became too tired to get out of bed.\n",
      "I created a workout for her to do in bed, consisting of leg lifts, crunches (with me holding down her legs), and arm circles — all done without standing up.\n",
      "The exercise did help my mom's digestion.\n",
      "It also helped her in ways I didn't imagine: going on walks helped her calm her mind, and exercising together in bed gave us another way to bond together.\n",
      "An act of creativity not only brought a solution to a problem, but it also created happy memories.\n",
      "In taking care of my mom, I've learned to use creative problem solving to help others, and to face challenges with positivity and resilience.\n",
      "I'm fascinated by the interdisciplinary potential of computer science.\n",
      "Beyond data structures and algorithms, it's about solving problems creatively.\n",
      "When I entered high school, I started teaching myself through MIT's OpenCourseWare, working my way through problem sets with Python.\n",
      "In sophomore year, I took C++ courses at Foothill College.\n",
      "In addition to teaching me about object-oriented programming and pointers, my professor introduced me to the 3 P's: Patience, Practice, and Perseverance.\n",
      "Today, I strive to use the 3 P's in everything I do.\n",
      "My junior year, I realized technology could positively impact the way our school newspaper told stories, making them more compelling and accessible.\n",
      "As a student journalist, I saw that our community was filled with powerful stories that couldn't fit in a monthly paper.\n",
      "So, I decided to build a website to put our stories online.\n",
      "The website increased our viewership, allowing parents and alumni to engage with our stories.\n",
      "When several staffers wrote online stories relating to the #MeToo movement, I compiled the stories together and coded our publication's first multimedia package.\n",
      "It was an unique way our audience could experience a story, and I want to continue combining code and journalism to present powerful stories: from analyzing data for investigative stories to creating multimedia projects.\n",
      "When my mom's breast cancer was diagnosed after she experienced symptoms, I wondered whether a machine-learning-based model could have detected her cancer during an annual mammogram months earlier, instead.\n",
      "I immersed myself in neural networks, activation and loss functions, weights and biases, pulling together Python libraries to create a model that can recognize breast cancer in mammograms.\n",
      "I was so excited when, uploading my mom's mammogram to the model, I watched it circle her cancer's location in red.\n",
      "I hope to continue this research in other fields, finding meaning of the world's piles of data.\n",
      "Computer science is more than an academic subject: it's a way to search for new solutions, to expand possibilities.\n",
      "I want to study both computer science and the humanities to tell compelling stories as a journalist and better solve problems that impact the people around me.\n",
      "As a student journalist, I've learned that every person has a meaningful story to tell.\n",
      "Sharing and listening to stories can make us more open-minded, compassionate, and understanding of the people and the world around us.\n",
      "I seek out the stories of others, listening and sharing them with compassion.\n",
      "Stories bring awareness and create tangible change.\n",
      "My co-editor\n",
      "and I filmed a documentary on the wave of youth activism following the Parkland shooting to capture this movement for our community; at our first screening, we distributed voter-registration forms.\n",
      "When I collected data on students' experiences with bullying for a feature, the principal shared it at an all-staff meeting about school culture.\n",
      "I wrote an editorial that brought attention to the school's lack of emergency preparedness; the following school year, administrators conducted a Run, Hide, Defend drill.\n",
      "I interviewed a student at our school, who showed me how one person's courage to speak out can spark a movement.\n",
      "He told me about his loneliness and depression, which led to drug use and an intentional overdose his senior year.\n",
      "He wanted others to hear his story: to break the stigma around mental health in our community, to help others realize they're not alone, to spread hope and positivity.\n",
      "I spent countless hours writing the story, knowing I had to do it justice.\n",
      "I hoped it could inspire others the same way it inspired me.\n",
      "The story created a ripple effect.\n",
      "Our newspaper's online traffic tripled, surpassing 1,200 views for the first time.\n",
      "At our school, mental health issues are apparent, but rarely talked about.\n",
      "The story led to students having more open conversations about mental health.\n",
      "A teacher said it reminded him of why he became a teacher.\n",
      "A parent translated the article into Chinese and shared it in a group-chat with hundreds of parents, where they discussed how to address mental health with their own children.\n",
      "Stories acknowledge the voices of individuals, bringing the community together.\n",
      "I want to use journalism to make people feel heard, to empower others to share their voices and to inspire positive change.\n",
      "Although I joined the school newspaper on a whim and had previously planned to take AP Computer Science, journalism has become a core part of the person I am today.\n",
      "To me, journalism is a way to see the world with curiosity and compassion.\n",
      "Everyone has a story, and journalism allows me to hear those stories — to learn more about the people around me and be inspired by them.\n",
      "Journalism tells people, 'Your story matters,' and I want to be someone who helps the community by showing people that their voices are important.\n",
      "I also love the fast-paced nature of journalism,\n",
      "how it pushes me to tap into abilities I never knew I had, like produce a high-quality story on a tight deadline.\n",
      "Journalism has taught me to experience the world with an open mind, to soak every moment in — because wherever you go, there's an exciting story.\n",
      "It's Tuesday lunch.\n",
      "My club officers and I begin with a presentation about spicing up grammar lessons for English learners.\n",
      "Then, the classroom lights up with discussion, each tutor sharing about their student. '\n",
      "He's so motivated!'\n",
      "says Sanjana, describing her 17-year-old student who wants to fight for peace in Syria.\n",

      "What do you guys think I should do?'Together, our group come up with ways to help her student feel more comfortable during the online tutoring sessions.\n",
      "Two years ago, near the end of my sophomore year, this community of 30 people was only 3:\n",
      "my history teacher, my classmate, and me.\n",
      "Our world history teacher opened my eyes to the Syrian Refugee Crisis and the political, economic, and social factors that made it so difficult to solve.\n",
      "My classmate and I would stay in her classroom after school just talking about it, wishing there was something we could do.\n",
      "Then, I learned about Paper Airplanes — an organization that connects English-speaking students with same-aged Syrian refugees to tutor.\n",
      "I told my friend about it, and last year we implemented it at Lynbrook.\n",
      "Through tutoring, we've learned to become better communicators and realized that, despite our students' varied life experiences, we're still the same: teenagers with big dreams who just want to have fun.\n",
      "When I see a new club member begin tutoring, I'm filled with hope and excitement for them, eager to help them learn more about the world and make a new friend.\n",
      "This community shares a love for education, helping others, and immersing ourselves in world issues, trying to make a difference, instead of turning a blind eye to problems too difficult to solve.\n",
      "Why that College or School?Computer science isn't just writing code to create a project; it's a way of assessing problems and devising solutions for them.\n",
      "This way of thinking — of breaking large problems into smaller, manageable pieces that can be solved by teams of people, of constantly coming up with ways to improve — can be applied to so many fields, from medicine to education to journalism.\n",
      "At the University of Michigan, I hope to double major in computer science and communications to create systems that allow the stories we share to have a wider impact.\n",
      "Last year, I created a website for our school newspaper because I wanted to tell more stories than could fit in a monthly 16-page paper.\n",
