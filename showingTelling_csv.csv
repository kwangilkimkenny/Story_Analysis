0,"London in the 1860s was a cold, damp, foggy city crisscrossed with cobblestone streets and pedestrians carefully dodging the droppings of steeds that pulled all manner of public conveyance. One such pedestrian was Lucy Knight, a beautiful, young, unattached woman in a hurry to get to Piccadilly Circus. An eligible bachelor had asked her to meet him thereÅc"
0,We walked down the stairs and Julain went to the old and empty library. The creditors and usurers had taken everything they can.
0,It was really dark and I couldnÅft see the stairs clearly.
0,It was really humid and hot. I was going to Calle Canuda to meet Barcel_ while carrying some books. I went up the stairs and into the reading rooms filled with sleepy readers under a fan.

1,John wiped tears down his face as he watched his girlfriend board the plane.
1,"Only a single dim candle lit the room. The house smelled like dust and rotting wood, and something faintly metallic that made John think of blood. Stuffed animals were mounted around the room: a wild-eyed buck, a grizzly frozen in fury, a screech owl with sharp yellow talons."
1,"Crunching hit my ears from behind, accelerating the already rampant pounding of my heart."
1,"I met her at the town square, running in for our usual hug that carried on for far too long as we gushed about our lives with smiles lighting our faces."
1,"The faint scent of stale cigarette smoke met her nostrils, pulling her face into a familiar grimace."
1,"When she wrapped her arms around him, the sweet staleness of tobacco enveloped her, and he was shivering."
1,"BillÅfs nose burned in the frigid air, and he squinted against the sun reflecting off the street."
1,Suzie felt for the bench with a white cane.
1,Leaves crunched beneath his feet.
1,"She wore coveralls carried a plunger and metal toolbox, and wrenches of various sizes hung from a leather belt around her waist. ÅgPoint me to the head,Åh she said."
1,"I barely touched my food, riveted by Tim. ÅgLet me tell you another story,Åh he said."
1,My palms were sweaty. I popped my knuckles. I looked in my backpack three times for no reason.
1,"My leg kept shaking, and I turned my head to look at the clock every few seconds."
1,"She kicked open the screen door, letting it slam against the wall as she dashed outside. Down the steps and into the yard she flew. Grabbing the first rock in her path, she hurled it back toward the house. It crashed through the living room window with an explosion of shattered glass."
1,My sister competes in weightlifting
1,"championships, sings lead vocals in a rock band, and speaks five languages."
1,"HeÅfs drenched in sweat, his knuckles are white, heÅfs on the other side of the ping-pong table, and IÅfm about to bring him down."
1,"Joey hadnÅft seen his father for a long, long time _ not since he was in kindergarten. He couldnÅft remember his fatherÅfs face very well. But at night, he could still hear him say, ÅgGood night, Joey. I love you.Åh"
1,"Alvin hated the way [his grandfather] was always watching. The slack, distorted mouth, twisted to one side after last yearÅfs stroke. The thin arms, bulging veinsÅc he couldnÅft look at him anymore. He thought he could smell him though _ a waft of stale piss."
1,Old Mr Chan used a tissue to wipe the sweat from his face. He got ready for
1,"the slow, steep walk up the stairs. ÅeEvery day, itÅfs the same,Åf he thought."
1,"The lights suddenly went out. In the darkness, the wind"
1,"and rain grew louder and seemed closerÅcJoey sat still,"
1,"his heart beating fast. It made a Åethump, thump, thumpÅf"
1,noise in his chest.
1,"She had moved so quickly, her hand going back and across in one movement, slapping his left cheek with a crack that silenced the room. The pain hung hot on his cheek."
1,It seemed a shadow had fallen over him. But there was no shadow. His heart had given a great jump up into his throat and was choking him. Then his blood slowly chilled and he felt the sweat of his shirt cold against his flesh.
1,The little girl pressed so close to the window that her breath fogged the glass.
1,My mother and I would take walks to watch the glow of the chapelÅfs stained glass.
1,The sorority sisters cheerfully decorated the halls with green garlands and streamers of
1,red crepe paper.
1,I climbed up the wooden fence and got a splinter in the palm of my hand.
1,Dominique graciously presents sweet treats of sugar-dusted wafers and creamy milk
1,chocolate to her customers.
1,"Bright-red ribbons, dimly-lit candles, and a green cloth decorated the Christmas table."
1,"Twinkling like cheerful flares, the lights sent signals from village to village."
1,"She tripped and fell backward, then stood up with blushing cheeks and shaking hands."
1,"Whenever I am scheduled to give a speech, I suffer with wet, clammy hands and"
1,butterflies in my stomach.
1,Two hockey players take unsuccessful swipes at the puck.
1,I awaken to the annoying buzz of my alarm clock at 6:30 a.m. I am anything but ready to face the day ahead of me. I drag myself to
1,"the bathroom, where I brush my teeth, take a quick shower, and wash and dry my hair. After changing outfits three or four times, I"
1,"run down the stairs, let my dog out, and inhale my breakfast. I scramble for my books and jacket, then race out the front door. I"
1,"barely make it to my bus on time. Once in the seat, I heave a sigh of relief because I will not be late to school today."
1,"As his mother switched off the light and left the room, Michael tensed. He huddled under the covers, gripped the sheets, and held his breath as the wind brushed past the curtain."
1,The dry orange leaves crunched under my feet as I pulled the collar up on my coat.
1,"I once had a garden. I can remember the smell of the turned earth, the plump shapes of bulbs held in the hands, fullness, the dry rustle of seeds through the fingers. Time could pass more swiftly that way. Sometimes the CommanderÅfs Wife has a chair brought out, and just sits in it, in her garden. From a distance it looks like peace."
1,"Now here he was, chasing his boat down the left of Witcham Street. He was running fast but the water was running faster and his boat was pulling ahead. He heard a deepening roar and saw that fifty yards farther down the hill the water in the gutter was cascading into a storm drain that was still open. It was a long dark semi-circle cut into the curbing, and as Georgie watched, a stripped branch, its bark as dark and glistening as sealskin, shot into the storm drainÅfs maw."
1,"My morning breath warmed the pillow, and I changed the subject in my mind. Today was not a day for second-guessing or regret, it was a day for doing. Downstairs, I could hear the return of a long-lost sound: Amy making breakfast. Banging wooden cupboards (rump-thump!), rattling containers of tin and glass (ding-ring!), shuf_ing and sorting a collection of metal pots and iron pans (ruzz-shuzz!). A culinary orchestra tuning up, clattering vigorously toward the _nale."
1,"She had never entirely let go of the notion that if she reached far enough with her thoughts she might find someone waiting, that if two people were to cast their thoughts outward at the same moment they might somehow meet in the middle."
1,"""Where's Papa going with that ax?"" said Fern to her mother."
1,"""Out to the hoghouse,"" replied Mrs. Arable. ""Some pigs were born last night."""
1,"""I don't see why he needs an ax,"" continued Fern, who was only eight."
1,"""Well,"" said her mother, ""one of the pigs is a runt. It's very small and weak, and it will never amount to anything. So your father has decided to do away with it."""
1,"""Do away with it?"" shrieked Fern. ""You mean kill it? Just because it's smaller than the others?"""
1,"A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen. The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy odours. There were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside. The sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place, were the public-housesÅc Oliver was just considering whether he hadn't better run away, when they reached the bottom of the hill."
1,"He could hear Beatty's voice. ÅgSit down, Montag. Watch. Delicately, like the petals of a flower. Light the first page, light the second page. Each becomes a black butterfly. Beautiful, eh? Light the third page from the second and so on, chain-smoking, chapter by chapter, all the silly things the words mean, all the false promises, all the second-hand notions and time-worn philosophies.Åh"
1,"Archie scrabbling up the stairs, as usual cursing and blinding, wilting under the weight of boxes that Clara could carry two, three at a time without effort; Clara taking a break, squinting in the warm May sunshine, trying to get her bearings. She peeled down to a little purple vest and leaned against her front gate. What kind of a place was this? That was the thing, you see, you couldnÅft be sure."
1,She yawned.
1,Her stomach rumbles.
1,"Ekaterina was shocked by the cold. SheÅfd known winters before, but never this far north and never this deep. Burrowed under furs as she was, she still felt her eyelashes freeze. There were crystals of ice on her face where her own breath had frozen solid. It was a clear night, and they raced through the whispering pines, like a feather drawn over a sheet of silver. It seemed magical. Impossible. Temporary. Forbidden."
1,"In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. Åc The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive Åc floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside Åc the lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher."
1,Bowen lifts the 1953 fish-restaurant newspaper out of the wooden wall box.
1,ÅeI suppose that can go.Åf
1,"He looks glumly at the mess behind the cupboard, knowing that itÅfll be his job to clean it. Katie looks into the box, now missing its newspaper floor."
1,"Glances once, then looks more sharply."
1,"ÅeNo, thatÅfs not right,Åf she says, and starts picking at the bottom with a fingernail."
1,"I already looked under the newspaper and saw just the pale, bleached colour of old pine _ pine that has never seen the sun _ but that was me being dumb. Me not knowing how to see."
1,Katie picks at the bottom and it comes away.
1,"A sheet of paper, blank on the upper side, but with writing in clear purplish-black ink on the lower. Latin text. A hard-to-read medieval hand."
1,She trembled and looked up at him with fear in her eyes.
1,Roger had been working on the crossword puzzle for two hours; so far he had scribbled out more spaces than he had gotten correct. All he had to show for his hard work so far were ink stains on his hands.
1,His boots crunched as he walked behind the bar. ÅgHoly shit!Åh he screamed when he saw the pool of blood.
1,He took a bite and quickly spit out the pancake. ÅgDarlene! WhyÅfd you put too much baking powder in the pancakes again?Åh
1,"With yellow eyes glowing red, long, black fur that stood on end, a mouth full of sharp pointed teeth that emitted a yowl like a tiger, I knew that the small animal before me was no ordinary cat."
1,"Mushrooms and pepperoni sausage formed thick layers on top of one another while the white mozzarella cheese bubbled over the bright red tomato sauce. Each time I took a bite I planned it so that I got a taste of every luscious ingredient. My taste buds celebrated every single time! Oooh, so good."
1,"As the footsteps tapped closer and closer, Jack felt his stomach muscles tighten. He flattened himself to the wall, the gritty bricks against his cheek. Sweat chilled his palms. He used both hands to steady the gun."
1,"Brenda slammed his dresser drawer shut and spun around, her hands hidden behind her back. Her lips jerked into a stiff smile. ""Dave! IÅ]I thought you wouldn't be home until six o'clock."""
1,"Mary's blue eyes glistened with joy, her blond hair bouncing with each step."
1,"Molly is always there when anyone needs her. She's the first to arrive with a casserole when someone is sick, the first to send a note of encouragement to those who are troubled, the first to offer a hug to anyone Å]Å] man, woman or child Å]Å] at anytime."
1,I held my hand in front of my eyes but couldnÅft see its outline. The walls were invisible and it was impossible to see the bottom of the steep stairs.
1,Mushrooms and pepperoni sausage were layered thickly on top of one another while the white mozzarella cheese bubbled over the bright red tomato sauce.
1,"The old house stood eerily abandoned on the hill, scaring everyone in the neighborhood with creaking, breathing noises."
1,"The calcium in milk, cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products, the vitamins in vegetables, and the protein in meal all help to keep our bodies strong and healthy."
1,"I ran to the door, threw it open with a loud bang against the wall, and yelled, ÅgGet in this house right this minute! You are three hours late!Åh"
1,"Jim grabbed the front of Blair's shirt and slammed him into the wall. Blair fought to breathe, his heart hammering."
1,A harsh wind whipped through the trees. Dark clouds poured buckets of rain that overran the gutters and spilled onto the sidewalks.
1,"Aaron stepped out into the bright summer sun with a smile on his face. Whistling a little tune, he walked up to his Porsche, and admired its shiny, brand-new body and rims. ÅgGood morning, Thunderboy!Åh he said, and he couldnÅft help but bend down and press a gentle kiss on its shiny black hood. He dropped his doctorÅfs bag on the passenger seat, hopped in and let the motor roar up."
1,"Cynthia shrieked, pulled wildly at her hair, and slammed the door, leaving her little brother alone and confused in the hallway."
1,I stood mesmerized as the white caps of the ocean waves dug into the sand as if grasping for one more breath of life.
1,"Author Jay Vance described the protagonist, Jim, as Åga lonely, isolated human beingÅcneither the life of the party, nor the"
1,"As I took my first bite of the hot slice, piled high with melted provolone and thick pepperoni, I knew I had found a small ÅgsliceÅh of heaven."
1,"Tom threw his books into his bag, crumpling his half-complete homework; he sighed."
1,"When MikeÅfs mother asked him to find the lost puppy, Mike groaned, ÅgDo I have to, Mom?Åh"
1,Jay waited the whole day to go to reading class and he always smiled when he got there.
1,"ÅgOh my God, I am five minutes late!Åh"
1,I snuck into Mr. GibsonÅfs room in my stealth Ninja steps.
1,"The morning air was bitter ice in her nose and mouth, and dazzling frost lay on every bud and branch."
1,"A saw and hammer dangled from his belt and an adze was hooked into it, one thumbnail was black, and when he bowed she saw several long wood-shavings caught in his curly hair."
1,They gripped each other and the tweed of his jacket was rough under her cheek. His hand came up to stroke her hair; she smelled leather and horses on the skin of his wrist. He was trembling.
1,"Show us how James stands at the bar, give us what he says, show us Anna looking up into his face and seeing love in his smile... and then show us what James says, in the gents' toilet, about making sure this girl - ""What's her name? Anna?"" - doesn't discover his address."
1,"From behind came the pounding of hoofbeats. Tree branches whipped across OriasÅfs face and showered his saddle with leaves. He gritted his teeth, his face set in the snarl that had become his protection against an unjust world. They would not catch him. Must not catch him."
1,"_He spurred his horseÅfs bloodied sides, and his fingers itched to reach for the broadsword sheathed on his back. His blood thundered in his veins, pulsing against the oyster white of his skin, sharpening his reflexes, narrowing his thoughts to razor intensity."
1,"_His tired horse stumbled, and the hoofbeats behind drew nearer. Voices shouted: ÅgStop now! In the name of Mactalde, surrender!Åh"
1,_He spat an oath and ducked another tree branch. Even the manÅfs nameÅ\dead though he was these twenty yearsÅ\burned through the air like a curse.
1,"Hoofbeats slowed and faded, surpassed by the rapid clatter of rifles rising to aim and the click of bolts locking into place. OriasÅfs blood congealed in his veins."
1,"Just another few metres. Mary looked up the sheer cliff face, at the few remaining metres above her head. Her arms ached, but she kept climbing, moving slowly and steadily from one foothold to the next. She could not give in to exhaustion now. Not until she'd reached safety."
1,"Leaves crunched beneath her feet, a carpet of red and gold and decaying brown."
1,Tiffany gripped the sheets in bunches between her cold fingers. Her forehead was slick with sweat. The door rattled again and again against its weak hinges. She didnÅft imagine it would be long before he got in.
1,"The crowd boiled like a simmering cauldron. When the guards werenÅft looking, some of the people threw apple cores, aimed at the well-polished helmets. Yells and curses cut through the air. The captain stepped forward with his hands spread out."
1,"Luke drew his sword. He eyed the graceful movements of the man standing in front of him. His opponent held his sword easily, as one would after a lifetime of applying it. Luke willed his hands to stay dry."
1,"Susie shifted her weight, never bringing her eyes up fully to meet mine. When she did speak, she interrupted the sentence by biting her lip. ÅgYou have nothing to worry about.Åh"
1,"For ten or fifteen minutes Elroy held a course upstream, the river choppy and silver-gray, then he turned straight north and put the engine on full throttle. I felt the bow lift beneath me. I remember the wind in my ears,"
1,"the sound of the old outboard Evinrude. For a time I didnÅft pay attention to anything, just feeling the cold spray against my face, but then it occured to me that at some point we mustÅfve passed into Canadian waters ... Elroy cut the engine, letting the boat fishtail lightly about twenty yards off shore. The old man didnÅft look at me or speak."
1,"Bending down, he opened up his tackle box and busied himself with a bobber and a piece of wire leader, humming to himself, his eyes down."
1,"Sally clutched the hem of her dress, then forced herself to release it and straightened the fabric with long, nervous strokes. ÅgI donÅft know,Åh she said."
1,"Sally clutched the hem of her dress. ÅgI donÅft know.Åh She forced herself to release the dress and straightened the fabric with long, nervous strokes. ÅgI really donÅft know.Åh"
1,"The flowers in the front garden were long dead. The grass was knee-high. Paint was flaking from the window frames. As she pushed open the front door, a rotten smell hit her. Patches of damp mold crept up the walls. She took one step forward, stepping onto an uneven, creaky floorboard."
1,"As the sun set in the evening sky, Malcolm slowly turned and walked toward his home. All was silent and still. Through the window, he could see his older brother James watching a football game on the TV. James was home from his first year of college in the city. It was lonely at times, but Malcolm felt it was rather nice to not be in JamesÅf shadow during his senior year of high school."
1,"AND THEN, one day all foreign Jews were expelled from Sighet. And Moishe the Beadle was a foreigner. Crammed into cattle cars by the Hungarian police, they cried silently. Standing on the station platform, we too were crying."
1,"The train disappeared over the horizon; all that was left was thick, dirty smoke."
1,"Behind me, someone said, sighing, ÅeWhat do you expect?"
1,ThatÅfs warÅc
1,"October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire."
1,"LondonÅfs West End, 1862"
1,"Lucy Knight mince-stepped around clumps of horse dung as she hurried toward Regent Street. Must not be late, she told herself. What would he think?"
1,"She carefully navigated the cobblestones as she crossed to hail a Hansom CabÅ\which she preferred for its low center of gravity and smooth turning. Lucy did not want to appear as if sheÅfs been tossed about in a carriage, especially tonight."
1,"ÅgNot wearinÅf a ring, I see,Åh the driver said as she boarded."
1,ÅgI beg your pardon?Åh
1,ÅgNice lookinÅf lady like yourself out alone after dark in the cold fogÅcÅh
1,"ÅgYou neednÅft worry about me, sir. IÅfm only going to the circus.Åh"
1,"ÅgPiccadilly it is, MaÅfam.Åh"
1,"We walked down the stairs again, and when we reached the ground floor, Juli_n made his way to the library. The shelves were empty, the fireplace choked with rubble. The walls, a deathly pale, flickered in the breath of the flame. Creditors and usurers had managed to remove every last bit of it, most of which must be lost in the twisted heaps of some junkyard by now. . . ."
1,"A glutinous darkness came at us from the other side. A little further back, the form of a staircase could be discerned. Black stone steps descended until they were lost in shadows."
1,"That Sunday, clouds spilled down from the sky and swamped the streets with a hot mist that made the thermometers on the walls perspire. Halfway through the afternoon, the temperature was already grazing the nineties as I set off towards Calle Canuda for my appointment with Barcel_, carrying the book under my arm and with beads of sweat on my forehead. . . . A grand stone staircase led up from a palatial courtyard to a ghostly network of passageways and reading rooms. . . . I glided up to the first floor, blessing the blades of a fan that swirled above the sleepy readers melting like ice cubes over their books."
1,"A reef of clouds and lightning raced across the skies from the sea. . . . My hands were shaking, and my mind wasnÅft far behind. I looked up and saw the storm spilling like rivers of blackened blood from the clouds, blotting out the moon and covering the roofs of the city in darkness. I tried to speed up, but I was consumed with fear and walked with leaden feet, chased by the rain. I took refuge under the canopy of a newspaper kiosk, trying to collect my thoughts and decide what to do next. A clap of thunder roared close by, and I felt the ground shake under my feet. . . . On the flooding pavements the streetlamps blinked, then went out like candles snuffed by the wind. There wasnÅft a soul to be seen in the streets, and the darkness of the blackout spread with a fetid smell that rose from the sewers._ The night became opaque, impenetrable, as the rain folded the city in its shroud."
1,"The first spring of 1946, he had stumbled out of the darkness of war and into a Florentine coffee house, where he was served by a waitress truly like the sun: Ophelia Diagilo, dressed all in yellow, spreading warmth and the promise of sex as she passed him a frothy cappuccino."
1,"While she was out of the room he looked at the pictures on her dresser and the ones hanging on the walls. Family pictures with Carl on their wedding day, on the church steps somewhere. The two of them in the mountains beside a creek. A little black and white dog. He knew Carl a little bit, a decent man, pretty calm, he sold crop insurance and other kinds of insurance to people all over Holt County twenty years ago, had been elected mayor of the town for two terms."
1,"It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it; but as matters stood, it was a town of unnatural red and black Åc It had a black canal in it, and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling dye, and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long, and where the piston of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and down, like the head of an elephant in a state of melancholy madness."
1,"Small flames stirred at the trunk of a tree and crawled away through leaves and brushwood, dividing and increasing. One patch touched a tree trunk and scrambled up like a bright squirrel. The smoke increased, sifted, rolled outwards. The squirrel leapt on the wings of the wind and clung to another standing tree, eating downwards."
1,"The deep green pool of the Salinas River was still in the late afternoon. Already the sun had left the valley to go climbing up the slopes of the Gabilan Mountains, and the hilltops were rosy in the sun. But by the pool among the mottled sycamores, a pleasant shade had fallen."
1,"The public-houses, with gas-lights burning inside, were already open. By degrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people were met with. Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to their work; then, men and women with fish-baskets on their heads; donkey-carts laden with vegetables; chaise-carts filled with livestock or whole carcasses of meat; milk-women with pails; an unbroken concourse of people trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town. As they approached the City, the noise and traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle."
1,"The cold carved bone deep, fueled by the lash of the wind, iced by the drowning rain gushing from a bloated sky. Such was Iona's welcome to Ireland. She loved it. How could she not? she asked herself as she hugged her arms to her chest and drank in the wild, soggy view from her window. She was standing in a castle. She'd sleep in a castle that night. An honest-to-God castle in the heart of the west."
1,"Her hand reached for the massive, iron door handle. She struggled to pull it toward her. A sapphire studded the top of the handle and, as she slowly made progress on the door, a slash of light popped through. It warmed her face and made her smile, giving her enough energy to heave the massive hunk of wood open wide enough to slip through."
1,"The way the door decisively slammed behind her should've frightened her. Instead, she looked upon spans of green, rolling hills bedecked with colorful poppies and tiny thatched-roof cottages. She debated between rolling down the plush hill at her feet or lifting straight off the ground and flying into the tiny village below."
1,"Dust coated every last surface. He ran his finger across the rows of books, the span of tables, and the wide window frames. It came up black. A fast-winged crow clipped past his ear and he wondered which broken window the ugly creature entered through. As it perched atop a broken spray of glass and squaked at him, he realized he'd never find her again. He was every bit as broken as the tired home, filmed in faithlessness."
1,"The lime green patio umbrella flapped happily in the breeze. It covered strawberry slushies, watermelon pies, and bright, cheerful stacks of donuts. Emily stepped outside to feature a crystal pitcher of pink lemonade and a spray of warm cookies in the center of the table. She had on her favorite summer dress and knew that, as soon as he stepped through that patio gate, her life would never be the same again."
1,"""And after all the weather was ideal. They could not have had a more perfect day for a garden-party if they had ordered it. Windless, warm, the sky without a cloud. Only the blue was veiled with a haze of light gold, as it is sometimes in early summer. The gardener had been up since dawn, mowing the lawns and sweeping them, until the grass and the dark flat rosettes where the daisy plants had been seemed to shine."""
