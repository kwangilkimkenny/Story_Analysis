ideas set out in a  whitepaper  by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto   \\ufeff The identity of the person or persons who created the technology is still a mystery  Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and  unlike government issued currencies  it is operated by a decentralized authority                       Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency  There are no physical bitcoins  only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to  All bitcoin transactions are verified by a massive amount of computing power  Bitcoins are not issued or backed by any banks or governments  nor are individual bitcoins valuable as a commodity  Despite it not being  legal tender   Bitcoin is very popular and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other cryptocurrencies  collectively referred to as  altcoins   Bitcoin is commonly abbreviated as  BTC                                     1 57        What Is Bitcoin                           Key Takeaways       Launched in 2009  bitcoin is the world s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization    Unlike fiat currency  bitcoin is created  distributed  traded  and stored with the use of a decentralized ledger system  known as a blockchain    Bitcoin s history as a store of value has been turbulent  the cryptocurrency skyrocketed up to roughly  20 000 per coin in 2017  but less than years later  it was trading for less than half of that    As the earliest virtual currency to meet widespread popularity and success  bitcoin has inspired a host of other cryptocurrencies in its wake                    The bitcoin system is a collection of computers  also referred to as  nodes  or  miners   that all run bitcoin s code and store its  blockchain   Metaphorically  a blockchain can be thought of as a collection of blocks  In each block is a collection of transactions  Because all the computers running the blockchain has the same list of blocks and transactions  and can transparently see these new blocks being filled with new bitcoin transactions  no one can cheat the system                   Anyone  whether they run a bitcoin  node  or not  can see these transactions occurring live  In order to achieve a nefarious act  a bad actor would need to operate 51  of the computing power that makes up bitcoin  Bitcoin has around 12 000 nodes  as of January 2021  and this number is growing  making such an attack quite unlikely   \\ufeff                      But in the event that an attack was to happen  the bitcoin miners—the people who take part in the bitcoin network with their computer—would likely fork to a new blockchain making the effort the bad actor put forth to achieve the attack a waste                       Balances of bitcoin tokens are kept using public and private  keys   which are long strings of numbers and letters linked through the mathematical  encryption  algorithm that was used to create them  The public key  comparable to a bank account number  serves as the address which is published to the world and to which others may send bitcoins         The private key  comparable to an ATM PIN  is meant to be a guarded secret and only used to authorize bitcoin transmissions  Bitcoin keys should not be confused with a bitcoin wallet  which is a physical or digital device that facilitates the trading of bitcoin and allows users to track ownership of coins  The term  wallet  is a bit misleading  as bitcoin s decentralized nature means that it is never stored  in  a wallet  but rather decentrally on a blockchain                 Bitcoin is one of the first digital currencies to use  peer to peer  technology to facilitate instant payments  The independent individuals and companies who own the governing computing power and participate in the bitcoin network—bitcoin  miners —are in charge of processing the transactions on the blockchain and are motivated by rewards  the release of new bitcoin  and transaction fees paid in bitcoin         These miners can be thought of as the decentralized authority enforcing the credibility of the bitcoin network  New bitcoin is released to the miners at a fixed  but periodically declining rate  There are only 21 million bitcoin that can be mined in total  As of January 30  2021  there are approximately 18 614 806 bitcoin in existence and 2 385 193 bitcoin left to be mined   \\ufeff        In this way  bitcoin other cryptocurrencies operate differently from fiat currency  in centralized banking systems  currency is released at a rate matching the growth in goods  this system is intended to maintain price stability  A decentralized system  like bitcoin  sets the release rate ahead of time and according to an algorithm                  Bitcoin mining  nbsp is nbsp the process by which bitcoins are released into circulation  Generally  mining requires the solving of computationally difficult puzzles in order to discover a new  block   which is added to the blockchain         Bitcoin mining adds and verifies transaction records across the network  For adding blocks to the blockchain  miners are rewarded with a few bitcoins  the reward is  halved  every 210 000 blocks  The block reward was 50 new bitcoins in 2009  On May 11th  2020  the third halving occurred  bringing the reward for each block discovery down to 6 25 bitcoins   \\ufeff        A variety of hardware can be used to mine bitcoin  However  some yield higher rewards than others  Certain computer chips  called Application Specific Integrated Circuits  ASIC   and more advanced processing units  like Graphic Processing Units  GPUs   can achieve more rewards  These elaborate mining processors are known as  mining rigs          One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places  100 millionths of one bitcoin   and this smallest unit is referred to as a Satoshi   \\ufeff If necessary  and if the participating miners accept the change  bitcoin could eventually be made divisible to even more decimal places                       The domain name bitcoin org is nbsp  registered   Today  at least  this domain is  WhoisGuard Protected   meaning the identity of the person who registered it is not public information               A person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto nbsp makes an nbsp announcement on the Cryptography Mailing list at metzdowd com   I ve been working on a new electronic cash system that s fully peer to peer  with no trusted third party  nbsp This now famous whitepaper published on bitcoin org  entitled   Bitcoin  A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System    would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today               The first Bitcoin block is mined   Block 0   This is also known as the  genesis block  and contains the text   The Times 03 Jan 2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks   perhaps as proof that the block was mined on or after that date  and perhaps also as relevant political commentary   \\ufeff\\ufeff              The first version of the nbsp  bitcoin nbsp software  is nbsp announced nbsp on the Cryptography Mailing list               Block 1 nbsp is mined  and nbsp bitcoin mining commences in earnest                 No one knows who invented bitcoin  or at least not conclusively  Satoshi nbsp Nakamoto nbsp is the name associated with the person or group of people who released the original nbsp bitcoin nbsp white nbsp paper nbsp in 2008 and worked on the original nbsp bitcoin nbsp software that was released in 2009  In the years since that time  many individuals have either claimed to be or have been suggested as the real life people behind the pseudonym  but as of January 2021  the true identity  or identities  behind Satoshi remains obscured   \\ufeff\\ufeff        Although it is tempting to believe the media s spin that Satoshi Nakamoto is a solitary  quixotic genius who created Bitcoin out of thin air  such innovations do not typically happen in a vacuum  All major scientific discoveries  no matter how original seeming  were built on previously existing research         There are precursors to nbsp bitcoin  nbsp Adam Back’s nbsp Hashcash  invented in 1997   \\ufeff\\ufeff and subsequently Wei nbsp Dai’s nbsp b money  Nick nbsp Szabo’s nbsp bit gold  and Hal Finney’s Reusable Proof of Work  The bitcoin whitepaper itself cites Hashcash nbsp and b money  as well as various other works spanning several research fields  Perhaps unsurprisingly  many of the individuals behind the other projects named above have been speculated to have also had a part in creating bitcoin         There are a few possible motivations for bitcoin s inventor deciding to keep their identity secret  nbsp One is privacy  nbsp As nbsp bitcoin nbsp has gained in popularity—becoming something of a worldwide phenomenon—Satoshi nbsp Nakamoto would likely garner a lot of attention from the media and from governments         Another reason could be the potential for bitcoin to cause a major disruption in the current banking and monetary systems  If bitcoin were to gain mass adoption  the system could surpass nations  sovereign fiat currencies  This threat to existing currency could motivate governments to want to take legal action against bitcoin s creator         The other reason is safety  nbsp Looking at 2009 alone  32 489 blocks nbsp were mined  at the reward rate of 50 bitcoin per block  the total payout in 2009 was 1 624 500 nbsp bitcoin  One may conclude that only Satoshi and perhaps a few other people were mining through 2009 and that they possess a majority of that stash of bitcoin         Someone in possession of that much bitcoin could become a target of criminals  especially since bitcoins are less like stocks and more like cash  where the private keys needed to authorize spending could be printed out and literally kept under a mattress  While it s likely the inventor of nbsp bitcoin nbsp would take precautions to make any extortion induced transfers traceable  remaining anonymous is a good way for Satoshi to limit exposure                       Bitcoins can be accepted as a means of payment for products sold or services provided  Brick and mortar stores can display a sign saying “Bitcoin Accepted Here”  the transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touch screen apps  An online business can easily accept bitcoins by adding this payment option to its other online payment options  credit cards  PayPal  etc               Those who are self employed can get paid for a job related to bitcoin  There are a number of ways to achieve this  such as creating any internet service and adding your bitcoin wallet address to the site as a form of payment  There are also several websites and job boards that are dedicated to digital currencies           Cryptogrind  brings together work seekers and prospective employers through its website    Coinality  features jobs—freelance  part time and full time—that offer payment in bitcoins  as well as other cryptocurrencies like  Dogecoin  and  Litecoin     Jobs4Bitcoins   part of reddit com    BitGigs     Bitwage  offers a way to choose a percentage of your work paycheck to be converted into bitcoin and sent to your bitcoin address                  4 24        How to Buy Bitcoin               There are many bitcoin supporters who believe that digital currency is the future  Many individuals who endorse bitcoin believe that it facilitates a much faster  low fee payment system for transactions across the globe  Although it is not backed by any government or central bank  nbsp bitcoin can be exchanged for traditional currencies  in fact  its exchange rate against the dollar attracts potential investors and traders interested in currency plays  Indeed  one of the primary reasons for the growth of digital currencies like bitcoin is that they can act as an alternative to national fiat money and traditional  commodities  like gold         In March 2014  the  IRS  stated that all virtual currencies  including bitcoins  would be taxed as  property  rather than currency  Gains or losses from bitcoins held as  capital  will be realized as  capital gains  or losses  while bitcoins held as  inventory  will incur ordinary gains or losses  The sale of bitcoins that you mined or purchased from another party  or the use of bitcoins to pay for goods or services  are examples of transactions that  can be taxed    \\ufeff        Like any other asset  the principle of buying low and selling high applies to bitcoins  The most popular way of amassing the currency is through buying on a bitcoin exchange  but there are many other ways to earn and own bitcoins                 Although Bitcoin was not designed as a normal equity investment  no shares have been issued   some speculative investors were drawn to the digital currency after it appreciated rapidly in May 2011 and again in November 2013  Thus  many people purchase bitcoin for its investment value rather than its ability to act as a  medium of exchange          However  the lack of guaranteed value and its digital nature means the purchase and use of bitcoins carries several inherent risks  Many investor alerts have been issued by the  Securities and Exchange Commission   SEC   the  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority   FINRA   the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau   CFPB   and other agencies         The concept of a virtual currency is still novel and  compared to traditional investments  bitcoin doesn t have much of a long term track record or history of credibility to back it  With their increasing popularity  bitcoins are becoming less experimental every day  still  after only a decade  all digital currencies still remain in a development phase   It is pretty much the highest risk  highest return investment that you can possibly make ” says   Barry Silbert  CEO of Digital Currency Group  which builds and invests in Bitcoin and blockchain companies   \\ufeff\\ufeff              Investing money into bitcoin in any of its many guises is not for the risk averse  Bitcoins are a rival to government currency and may be used for black market transactions  money laundering  illegal activities  or tax evasion  As a result  governments may seek to regulate  restrict  or ban the use and sale of bitcoins  and some already have   Others are coming up with various rules         For example  in 2015  the New York State Department of Financial Services finalized regulations that would require companies dealing with the buy  sell  transfer  or storage of bitcoins to record the identity of customers  have a compliance officer  and maintain capital reserves  The transactions worth  10 000 or more will have to be recorded and reported   \\ufeff\\ufeff        The lack of uniform regulations about bitcoins  and other virtual currency  raises questions over their longevity  liquidity  and universality               Most individuals who own and use bitcoin have not acquired their tokens through mining operations  Rather  they buy and sell bitcoin and other digital currencies on any of a number of popular online markets  known as bitcoin exchanges         Bitcoin exchanges are entirely digital and  as with any virtual system  are at risk from hackers  malware  and operational glitches  If a thief gains access to a bitcoin owner s computer hard drive and steals their private encryption key  they could transfer the stolen bitcoin to another account   Users can prevent this only if bitcoins are stored on a computer that is not connected to the internet  or else by choosing to use a  paper wallet —printing out the bitcoin private keys and addresses  and not keeping them on a computer at all          Hackers can also target bitcoin exchanges  gaining access to thousands of accounts and  digital wallets  where bitcoins are stored  One especially notorious hacking incident took place in 2014  when Mt  Gox  a bitcoin exchange in Japan  was  forced to close down  after millions of dollars worth of bitcoins were stolen   \\ufeff        This is particularly problematic given that all Bitcoin transactions are permanent and irreversible  It s like dealing with cash  Any transaction carried out with bitcoins can only be reversed if the person who has received them refunds them  There is no third party or a payment processor  as in the case of a debit or credit card—hence  no source of protection or appeal if there is a problem               Some investments are insured through the  Securities Investor Protection Corporation   Normal bank accounts are insured through the nbsp  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   FDIC  up to a certain amount depending on the jurisdiction         Generally speaking  bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin accounts are not insured by any type of federal or government program  In 2019  prime dealer and trading platform SFOX announced it would be able to provide bitcoin investors with FDIC insurance  but only for the portion of transactions involving cash   \\ufeff\\ufeff              While bitcoin uses private key encryption to verify owners and register transactions  fraudsters and scammers may attempt to sell false bitcoins  For instance  in July 2013  the SEC brought legal action against an operator of a bitcoin related Ponzi scheme   \\ufeff There have also been documented cases of bitcoin price manipulation  another common form of fraud               Like with any investment  bitcoin values can fluctuate  Indeed  the value of the currency has seen wild swings in price over its short existence  Subject to high volume buying and selling on exchanges  it has a high sensitivity to any newsworthy events  According to the CFPB  the price of bitcoins fell by 61  in a single day in 2013  while the one day price drop record in 2014 was as big as 80    \\ufeff        If fewer people begin to accept bitcoin as a currency  these digital units may lose value and could become worthless  Indeed  there was speculation that the  bitcoin bubble  had burst when the price declined from its all time high during the cryptocurrency rush in late 2017 and early 2018         There is already plenty of competition  and although bitcoin has a huge lead over the hundreds of other digital currencies that have sprung up because of its brand recognition and nbsp  venture capital  money  a technological break through in the form of a better virtual coin is always a threat              52 500     In February of 2021  the price of Bitcoin reached a record at the time of  52 500                  In the years since Bitcoin launched  there have been numerous instances in which disagreements between factions of miners and developers prompted large scale splits of the cryptocurrency community  In some of these cases  groups of Bitcoin users and miners have changed the protocol of the bitcoin network itself         This process is known as  forking   and it usually results in the creation of a new type of bitcoin with a new name  This split can be a  hard fork   in which a new coin shares transaction history with bitcoin up until a decisive split point  at which point a new token is created  Examples of cryptocurrencies that have been created as a result of hard forks include bitcoin cash  created in August 2017   bitcoin gold  created in October 2017   and bitcoin SV  created in November 2017          A  soft fork  is a change to protocol that is still compatible with the previous system rules  For example  bitcoin soft forks have increased the total size of blocks                                           Article Sources
