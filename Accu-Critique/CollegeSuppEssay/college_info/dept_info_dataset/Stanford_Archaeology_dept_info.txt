School Name: Stanford
Department: Archaeology Center
Major: Archaeology

Archaeology is changing: always an interdisciplinary endeavor, recent developments have eroded old disciplinary boundaries and archaeology is now at the forefront of project-based research and learning in which collaboration between the humanities, the social and natural sciences is at the fore. At the Center we seek to expand our leadership in archaeological research and collaboration in order to bring the material remains of the past into dialogue with contemporary concerns and responsibilities.

Today, the Center brings together Anthropology, Classics, East Asian Languages and Cultures, Stanfordâ€™s Archaeological Collection as well as Campus Archaeology in partnerships and innovative research, and connections are fostered with Earth Sciences, SLAC, the Cantor Arts Center, the Center for East Asian Studies, Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity, Latin American Studies, African Studies, the South Asia Center, the Abbasi Program, the Law School, Biology, Engineering, Medicine and History, and Stanford University Libraries.

Our aim is to use the Archaeology Center to attract and educate future leaders in archaeology who can solve the issues confronting our field today. We will achieve this by continually investing in leading edge research in scientific techniques, ethical and heritage education and hands-on multi-disciplinary opportunities for our scholars. The Center promotes a compelling plurality of perspectives, methods and in-depth understanding of global diversity and responsibility.
