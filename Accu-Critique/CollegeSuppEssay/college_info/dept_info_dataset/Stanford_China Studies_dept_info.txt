School Name: Stanford
Department: Department of East Asian Languages & Cultures
Major: East Asian Studies

The Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at Stanford is dedicated to study of the languages, literatures, linguistics and cultures of East Asia.

The department is home to the Confucius Institute at Stanford University, which is dedicated to research and pedagogy in Chinese language and culture. The Confucius Institute sponsors academic conferences and workshops, as well as occasional public lectures and performances open to the public.

The B.A. in East Asian Studies is a degree for the student who wants her or his education to be broad enough to understand a non-Western language and culture. Many students have found that the language skills acquired can be advantageous to their professional careers and have combined the major or minor with offerings in other Stanford departments such as Anthropology, Art, Economics, Education, History, Law, Linguistics, Philosophy, Political Science, Religious Studies and Sociology, as well as science and engineering. Immersion in the cultures of East Asia is a large and important part of the programs in the Department. Students are encouraged to spend at least one semester abroad, either in China or Japan, with Stanford's Overseas Study Program.
