The Information Systems & Operations Management (ISOM) area deals with the variety of approaches to structured and unstructured problem solving that have become critical to today's businesses and the hallmarks of modern consulting best-practices. The ISOM curriculum is designed to inform a wide range of professions, perhaps most emblematically that of consulting (in which systems and process problems are regularly tackled). Recent ISOM majors have been placed at such firms as Bain, McKinsey, PwC, and Hitachi.

To gain an appreciation of the dynamics of systems and processes, the ISOM curriculum offers a range of analytics courses that prepare you for dealing with large data sets, how to best apply statistical and computational methods in prediction, risk-assessment and strength/weakness detection, and the task of decision support application development to help automate and encapsulate intelligent approaches to problem solving. Along with preparation for analytical work, the ISOM curriculum offers courses that prepare you for best practices in management activity, including how to effectively account for operational and IT capabilities in strategy development and deployment and how to account for idiosyncrasies in individual and group psychology — issues that can either help or hinder strategic efforts.

Goizueta’s ISOM faculty ranks #4 internationally in terms of research productivity in elite outlets such as the Journal of Operations Management, MIS Quarterly, Production and Operations Management, and Information Systems Research. The ISOM curriculum reflects the strength of this knowledge base.
