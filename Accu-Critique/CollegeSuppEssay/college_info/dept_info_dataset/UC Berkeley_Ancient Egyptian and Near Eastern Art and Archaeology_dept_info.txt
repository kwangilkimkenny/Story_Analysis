Declaring the Major

Students are recommended to declare the major early in their academic careers. Near Eastern Studies 10 is a required course, which may be taken after declaring the major. Students should consult with the undergraduate student advisor regarding major requirements, transfer credits, and the opportunity to combine two disciplines through a double major study.  

Honors Program

With the consent of the faculty major advisor, students in any of the Near Eastern Studies majors, with an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 or higher in all coursework taken at the University and a GPA of 3.51 or higher in courses completed in the major, may apply for admission to the honors program in their senior year. Students must maintain the required GPA in the major in order to remain eligible for the honors program.

In addition to the GPA requirement, students must submit an honors thesis of at least 20 double-spaced, typewritten pages in their senior year. Students are required to enroll in an Independent Study course (NES 199) in the fall semester and the honors course (NE STUD H195) in the spring semester of their senior year in order to receive credit for the thesis. The honors thesis must be read and evaluated by a two-member committee consisting of a department faculty thesis supervisor and another member of the faculty. The thesis must be deemed to be of at least B+ quality in order to qualify the candidate for graduation with a degree of honors. Students may also receive distinctions of "high honors" or "highest honors" for outstanding thesis papers.
