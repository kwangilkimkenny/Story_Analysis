School Name: Stanford
Department: Civil and Environmental Engineering
Major: Civil and Environmental Engineering

Our mission is to advance education and research in engineering the built and natural environments, with a particular emphasis on long-term sustainability.

We use technologies from materials science, physics, biology, mathematics, computing and the social sciences to ask how we can best design and manage the buildings and cities, dams and water systems, highway networks and energy grids that support our daily lives.
Our teaching and research falls into these areas: Cities, Energy, Infrastructure, Public Health
Water

The civil engineering profession is concerned with the built environment. Civil engineers plan, design and construct major facilities including buildings, bridges, water and sanitation systems, transportation systems, energy systems and other civil infrastructure. Civil engineers help manage our air, water and energy resources and help protect society from natural catastrophes such as earthquakes and storms. Civil engineers also work to provide protection and remediation of the environment.

The Environmental Systems Engineering major is designed to prepare students for incorporating environmentally sustainable design, strategies and practices into natural and built systems. It focuses on preparing engineers for the 21st century challenges we will face in and near our cities, due to factors such as global climate change and population increase. Students can focus on coastal regions, freshwater systems, or urban energy and infrastructure.
