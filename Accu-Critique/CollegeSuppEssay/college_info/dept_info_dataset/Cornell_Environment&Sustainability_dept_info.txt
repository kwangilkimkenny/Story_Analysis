School Name: Cornell
Department: "College of Agriculture and Life Sciences
College of Arts and Sciences"
Major: Environment & Sustainability


The Environment & Sustainability (E&S) major provides students with a basis for understanding the causes and consequences of changing environments throughout the world. We seek to answer how do humans value, use, benefit from and protect the environment—and how do they do so sustainably?

Our students receive training in environmental natural sciences, social sciences and humanities, examining how these disciplines can be applied to develop policies and cultural practices that maintain biodiversity, sustain food production and develop renewable energy resources. The E&S major is available in the College of Agriculture & Life Sciences and the College of Arts & Sciences.

Core curriculum
Our core curriculum relies upon a foundation in biology, physical and social science, humanities, economics and statistics, supplemented by coursework and experiences integrating these topics of study. The curriculum provides flexibility to pursue greater depth in specific disciplines encompassing environmental and sustainability issues, while taking advantage of Cornell’s diverse range of courses and opportunities.
