Engineering Sciences covers broad range of courses in math, chemistry and physics. The program, offered through the Physics Department, combines cutting-edge science and technology training with a liberal arts foundation.

You’ll be prepared to lead interdisciplinary teams in creating solutions for rapidly evolving challenges in a wide variety of fields, including engineering management, patent law, medicine, and business as well as in political and governmental service. 

Engineering Science is also an excellent choice if you plan on pursuing a Master’s in engineering degree.  

Motivation
The BS in Engineering Sciences provides a rigorous foundation in the science
underlying modern technology, while allowing students to benefit from a broad
liberal arts curriculum. A carefully crafted liberal arts curriculum can build a
strong base for many essential aspects of engineering: fundamental
understanding of physics, chemistry, and other sciences; advanced mathematical
tools and programming skills; and principles of economics, business, and
technical writing.
Goal
The BS in Engineering Sciences is designed to prepare students to face the
challenges of rapidly advancing technology. The value of a rigorous science
education is recognized in industries that depend on cutting-edge technology.
The BS in Engineering Sciences is a great starting point for students interested in
professions that interface with engineers, such as engineering management and
patent law. This degree is also good preparation for graduate studies in
engineering.
