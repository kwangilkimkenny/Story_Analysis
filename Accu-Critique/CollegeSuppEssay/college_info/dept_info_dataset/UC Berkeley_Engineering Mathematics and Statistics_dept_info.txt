Major: Engineering Mathematics and Statistics

About the Program
Bachelor of Science (BS)

The Engineering Mathematics and Statistics major offered through the Engineering Science Program offers students an opportunity to study pure and applied mathematics as essential components of modern engineering. By combining courses in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, the physical sciences, and engineering, a student may individualize a program of study, of theory, or of applications of both. It provides a broad foundation for graduate studies in theoretical branches of engineering, as well as in mathematics, and can prepare students for a career in specific sectors of industry or business.

Admission to the Major

Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, please see the College of Engineering's website.

Admission to Engineering Science degree programs via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is competitive as there are few — if any — spaces available in this major for students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change to College of Engineering, please see the College's website.
