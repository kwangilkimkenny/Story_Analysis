Biomechanical Engineering Program
Where Mechanics and Biomedicine Meet
With over 200 medical device companies within 20 miles and three top-tier hospitals within walking distance, the Stanford campus provides a unique setting for medical innovation.
Faculty and students in Biomechanical Engineering are developing a combination of strong mechanical skills with a working understanding of biological and/or medical systems and processes. Investigations range from exploring how proteins fold and interact to designing the next generation of medical equipment and joint replacements. Biomechanical Engineering research encompasses not only fundamental scientific questions but also the endeavors that will bring discoveries to hospitals, clinics and society as a whole to improve general health, well-being and quality of life.
