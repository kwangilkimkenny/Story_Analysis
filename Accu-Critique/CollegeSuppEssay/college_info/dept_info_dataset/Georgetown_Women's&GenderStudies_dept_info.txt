The Women’s and Gender Studies Program provides an interdisciplinary, critical, feminist, and cross-cultural understanding of women, gender, and power in a global context. Focusing on the interactions/intersections of race, class, gender and sexuality, Women’s and Gender Studies fosters the generation of knowledge about women, men, gender, and sexuality in all their diversity and encourages the critical interrogation of traditional academic disciplines.
