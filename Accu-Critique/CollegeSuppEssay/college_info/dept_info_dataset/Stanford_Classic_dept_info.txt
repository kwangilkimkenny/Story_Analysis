As a Stanford undergraduate, how can you attend this great university and not at some point study the ancient world? Disciplines from philosophy, literary criticism, musicology and history to linguistics, political theory, and rhetoric arose in ancient Greece and were further developed in the Roman period. The sciences trace their origins largely to Greek precedents in physics, mechanics, mathematics, and biology. The very idea of a university and organized research into the human condition are rooted in Greco-Roman culture. Every student who enters Stanford deserves—and needs—to become familiar with this tradition.
