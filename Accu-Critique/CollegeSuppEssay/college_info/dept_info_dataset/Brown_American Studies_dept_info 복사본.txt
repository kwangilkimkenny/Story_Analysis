School Name: Brown
Department: American Studies
Major: American Studies


American Studies is an interdisciplinary concentration that is innovative and creative, offering new answers to complex questions about American society, cultures, and experiences. 

Exciting new directions build on our interests in gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity. Publicly-engaged scholarship in local and global contexts and the digital humanities play increasingly important roles in the production and dissemination knowledge by American Studies faculty and students.  Students learn to analyze social structures and practices of identity, space and place, and the production and consumption of culture.

American Studies concentrators take foundational courses within the department and often use courses around the University to round out their interdisciplinary look at the United States.  American Studies maintains strong ties to programs in Africana Studies, Ethnic Studies, Gender and Sexuality, Urban Studies and, most recently, the Masters program in Public Humanities.

The specific skills that concentrators will use and develop in order to achieve these intellectual goals articulated by these themes and approaches are:

Reading texts, objects and spaces critically and historically
Producing scholarship and creative work in different forms ranging from the traditional research paper to exhibitions to new media
Participating in forms of publicly publicly-engaged scholarship
Creating an ePortfolio that serves as part of the capstone experience

All are marked by the continuing interest of our faculty and students in public humanities and public policy, digital scholarship, the study of race and ethnicity, popular culture, and new avenues in transnational research, exploring the role of the United States in the world and the importance of the world in the United States.
