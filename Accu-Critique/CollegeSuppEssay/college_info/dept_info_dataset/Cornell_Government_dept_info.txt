As a government major, you’ll learn how to think and write rigorously and creatively about issues of public life. You’ll have the choice of courses in four subfields: American politics (the political behavior, policies and institutions of the U.S.), comparative politics (the institutions and political processes of other nations), political theory and philosophy (normative theories of politics and history of political thought) and international relations (transactions between states, international organizations and transnational actors).
Requirements

Want to start right away? Here are some basic requirements for students wanting to major in government. Keep in mind this isn’t the complete list of formal requirements — that list can be found on the Courses of Study page.
To complete the major, you need to:
Take two of the introductory government courses in the subfields of American Government (AM), Comparative Politics (CP), Political Theory (PT), and International Relations (IR)  (GOVT 1111, GOVT 1313, GOVT 1615, GOVT 1616 or GOVT 1817)
Take an additional course in a third subfield: American Government, Comparative Politics, Political Theory or International Relations. You're strongly advised to take at least one course in each of the four subfields.
Take an additional 28 credits of government course work at the 2000-level or above.
Complete at least one seminar-style course in government (which can be applied toward the 28 credits).
