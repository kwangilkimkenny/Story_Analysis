School Name: Stanford
Department: Civil and Environmental Engineering
Major: Atmosphere / Energy Program

tanford University's Atmosphere/Energy program bridges the gap between the two key disciplines of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

Atmosphere and energy are linked in two primary ways. First‚ fossil-fuel energy contributes directly to air pollution and climate change. Second‚ atmospheric winds‚ solar radiation and precipitation are sources of renewable wind‚ wave‚ solar and hydroelectric power. Combining the study of Atmosphere and Energy is a natural choice because the best ways to mitigate atmospheric problems are to increase the efficiency with which energy is used‚ optimize the use of natural energy resources, and understand the effects of energy technologies on the atmosphere.
