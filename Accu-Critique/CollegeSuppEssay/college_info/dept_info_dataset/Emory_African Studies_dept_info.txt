Major: African Studies

The African Studies program is an excellent way to develop geographically focused international expertise and to learn about the fascinating diversity of Africa's 55 nations. The program provides essential background and foundational skills for graduate work in anthropology, art history, history, literature, and any number of other disciplines.
Combined with majors or minors such as history, comparative literature, art history, economics, sociology, anthropology, or environmental studies, African Studies prepares students for possible positions with national or international organizations involved in Africa. Students preparing for careers in international health or medicine may combine the African Studies with a major in biology or another science, the new major in Human Health, or the minor in Global Health, Culture and Society based in the Center for the Study of Human Health (CSHH).
