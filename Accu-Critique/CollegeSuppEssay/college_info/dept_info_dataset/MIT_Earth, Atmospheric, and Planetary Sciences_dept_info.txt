The Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) is the place at MIT where the turbulent oceans and atmosphere, the inaccessible depths of the inner Earth, distant planets, and the origins of life all come together under one intellectual roof.
EAPS is about hard, quantitative science, known for its emphasis on academic rigor, hands-on training, collaboration, and the cross fertilization of ideas. Our work encompasses atmospheres, climate, geobiology, geochemistry, geology, geophysics, oceans, and planetary sciences.
