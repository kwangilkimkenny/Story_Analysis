School Name: Cornell
Department: "College of Agriculture and Life Sciences
College of Arts and Sciences"
Major: Information Science


Information Science offers options for study among a variety of fields, so that our students can create unique connections between disciplines and come up with an individualized course of study during their time in the program.

Cornell Information Science was born out of the need to provide a home for academics who wanted to study the use of technology rather than the creation of it. Starting as an interdisciplinary minor in 2002, Cornell Information Science grew into a full-fledged major graduating the first five students in 2005. Since then, we've grown to around 300 undergraduate majors enrolled across all three schools, about 85 master’s students and 50 PhDs. Our nearly 40 faculty members are leaders in their respective fields within Information Science's interdisciplinary structure, specializing in areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, ubiquitous computing, user-experience design, tech-law policy, and much more.

Cornell Information Science is one of three academic departments – along with Computer Science and Statistics and Data Science – housed under the parent unit Cornell Computing and Information Science, or CIS. Scholars from our department can be found on Cornell's two campuses: in Gates Hall on the Cornell University campus, located in Ithaca, NY, and at the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island in New York City.
