School Name: Georgetown
Department: Walsh School of Foreign Service
Major: International Economics

The International Economics (IECO) major is grounded in the belief that economic analysis is essential to the understanding of modern world affairs.
IECO students receive rigorous training in quantitative techniques and objective analysis. The major is excellent preparation for careers and leadership positions in the private or the public sector. Our students have built highly successful careers in finance, consulting, law, management, media, international development, international organizations, research institutes, government, non-profit organizations, and academia.
What do IECO students study? Our coursework focuses heavily on the behavior of social systems – such as markets, corporations, unions, international institutions, legislatures, and even families – through the lens of a unified analytical framework. The focus of the IECO major is on the way individuals make decisions and how those decisions add up and interact with one another, to produce the social systems we observe.
The applications of this approach to international issues are myriad, covering topics such as trade policy, international economic organizations, economic growth and development, international financial markets, financial crises, and international migration to name only a few.
