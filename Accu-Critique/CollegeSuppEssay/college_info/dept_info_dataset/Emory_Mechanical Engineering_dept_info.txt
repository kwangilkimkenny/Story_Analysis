School Name: Emory
Department: College of Arts and Sciences, Dual and Extended Degree Programs
Major: Mechanical Engineering/ Engineering

In cooperation with the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, the Laney Graduate School, and other professional schools at Emory, the College of Arts and Sciences is proud to offer pathways for students to graduate in disciplines outside of the offerings within the College itself.

Students completing a dual or extended degree program will graduate with a BA or BS from Emory College of Arts and Sciences while simultaneously graduating from the partner school or college with the relevant award to their chosen field of study.

The Dual Degree program gives Emory undergraduates the opportunity to study in one of our liberal arts programs before continuing on to Georgia Tech to tackle these challenges and more. Students can complete a major in any subject offered by Emory College while completing the required pre-requisites for one of the programs offered through Georgia Tech.

The Dual Degree program is not an official major at Emory College. Rather it is an academic opportunity for undegraduate students, with an interest in Engineering, to pursue bachelors degrees at both Emory College and Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech).

The minimum amount of time to complete both degrees is 5 years; however, the length of the program could take longer depending on the student's academic interests and studies. The program is sequential and students will receive a degree from each institution upon completion.
