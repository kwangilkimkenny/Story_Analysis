Department: Materials Science and Engineering
Major: Archaeology and Materials (Course 3-C)

Students who have a specific interest in archaeology and archaeological science may choose Course 3-C. The 3-C program is designed to afford students broad exposure to fields that contribute fundamental theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of ancient and historic societies. The primary fields include anthropological archaeology, geology, and materials science and engineering. The program enriches knowledge of past and present-day nonindustrial societies by making the natural and engineering sciences part of the archaeological tool kit.

The program's special focus is on understanding prehistoric culture through study of the structure and properties of materials associated with human activities. Investigating peoples' interactions with materials, the objects that such interactions produced, and the related environmental settings leads to a fuller analysis of the physical, social, cultural, and ideological world in which people function. These are the goals of anthropological archaeology, goals that are reached, in part, through science and engineering perspectives.
