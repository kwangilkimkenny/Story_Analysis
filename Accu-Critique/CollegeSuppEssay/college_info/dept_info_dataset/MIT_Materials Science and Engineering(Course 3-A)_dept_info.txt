Home to the world’s premier program focused on Materials Science and Engineering – the study of matter and how it is made. Our community members undertake interdisciplinary materials projects that draw on fundamental sciences in pursuit of beneficial engineering solutions. From construction materials to virus-grown nanostructures, we seek to understand the creation, composition, structure, properties, and performance of materials – and to derive new, effective, and sustainable alternatives.
