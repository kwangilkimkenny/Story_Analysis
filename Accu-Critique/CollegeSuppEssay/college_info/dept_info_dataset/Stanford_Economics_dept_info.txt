School Name: Stanford School of Humanities & Sciences
Department: Economics Department
Major: Economics

The Stanford Economics Department has two central missions: to train students at the undergraduate and graduate level in the methods and ideas of modern economics, and to conduct both basic and applied research in economics that pushes forward the frontier of knowledge in the field.

The department offers an undergraduate program that includes a wide array of courses in which students learn about both traditional ideas and cutting-edge research. The undergraduate program provides an excellent background for those going on to graduate work in professional schools (for example, business and law) as well as for Ph.D. programs in Economics and Finance. An undergraduate degree in Economics also provides a pathway to a diverse set of career opportunities, including jobs in private companies and public policy positions. Given their highly quantitative focus, Economics courses provide a useful applied complement to tools that students learn in mathematics, computer science, and statistics courses.
