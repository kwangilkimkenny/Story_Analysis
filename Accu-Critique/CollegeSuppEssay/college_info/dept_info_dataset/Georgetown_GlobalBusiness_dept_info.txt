The private sector has continued to play a significant role within all aspects of international affairs, interacting with governmental and non-governmental actors. A failure of a large firm can have real effects on people at all corners of the world. Development policies now recognize the critical role of private incentives at the most micro level. Corporations are under increasing scrutiny for their ethical and socially responsible behavior.
The Global Business (GBUS) major will provide BSFS students with a unique opportunity to combine a basic business education with their political and economic coursework, and their advanced language, research, and cross-cultural proficiencies. The major offers BSFS students access to courses offered by the McDonough School of Business (MSB) in accounting, international marketing, corporate finance, and business operations. Students are enabled to use the tools from the business disciplines to understand and analyze the firm and the private sector.
