School Name: UC Berkeley
Department: Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences/Materials Science and Engineering Joint Major
Major: Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences/Materials Science and Engineering Joint Major

About the Program
Bachelor of Science (BS)

The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. Both majors are shown on the student's transcript of record.

For students interested in materials and devices, a joint major in electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)/materials science and engineering (MSE) can be valuable. The program combines the study of materials from a broad perspective, as taught in MSE, with the study of their applications in electronic devices and circuits, as taught in EECS.

Admission to the Joint Major

Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the College of Engineering joint majors website for complete details.
