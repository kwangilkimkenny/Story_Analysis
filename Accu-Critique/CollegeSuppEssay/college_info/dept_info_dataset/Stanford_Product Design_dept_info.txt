The course work provides students with the skills necessary to carry projects from initial concept to completion of working prototypes.

The Product Design major is offered by the Mechanical Engineering department within the School of Engineering. As an interdisciplinary major, it consists of human-centered design methodologies, engineering skillsets and a breadth of course options in psychology, art, and engineering. This website details many of the aspects of being a student in the Product Design major.

Students studying product design follow the basic Mechanical Engineering curriculum and are expected to meet the University requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree. The program prepares students for careers in industry and for graduate study.
