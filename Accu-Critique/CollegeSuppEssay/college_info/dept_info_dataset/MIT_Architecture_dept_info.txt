The Department of Architecture at MIT is truly unique among architecture programs in its commitment to creating a culture of experimentation to expand the discipline and change the world.
At MIT, processes and acts of design, research, testing, and experimentation are intertwined and grounded in critical contemporary questions which require deep knowledge of the past and present as well as insights into the future. We enable and open up our studentsâ€™ understanding of the built environment as a cultural, technological, social, and ecological condition - one in which design is as critically focused on asking questions as it is about solving problems through intervening in the world.
The Department conceives of architecture as a discipline as well as a profession. It is structured in five semi-autonomous discipline groups: Architecture + Urbanism; Building Technology; Computation; History, Theory and Criticism of Architecture and Art; and Art, Culture, and Technology.
