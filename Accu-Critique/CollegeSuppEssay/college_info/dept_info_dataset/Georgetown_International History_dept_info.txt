School Name: Georgetown
Department: Walsh School of Foreign Service
Major: International History

History explores how societies have changed over time to make our contemporary world. History is essential to understanding the present—and to think about possible futures. International History emphasizes the ways the world has become ever more integrated during recent centuries. The interaction of global processes, national developments, and local lives are key concerns.
History is the pivotal discipline at the intersection of the social sciences and the humanities, instilling rigorous fact-based empirical habits of thought like those of scientists, integrated with social, cultural, and gender analyses of humanists, always recognizing the value of human empathy. Georgetown historians not only bring strengths in political and environmental, social and cultural studies engaging societies across the world—we are developing new emphases at the intersection of science and society.
History is not committed to one analytical perspective, but the integration of many. Historians analyze power, technology, and production, social relations and culture, war and peace, environment and gender, and more. We use textual sources and archival materials, quantitative studies, oral inquiries, and more. Ultimately the goal is the integrated analysis of how societies change—in International History we emphasize how global interactions shape key processes of change.
Students who major in International History emerge from their studies with diverse analytical skills, strong writing skills, and an ability to understand the world and many of its peoples as they have lived often-difficult times of change. They are prepared to engage our difficult times, exploring ongoing transformations while linking questions of power and culture, technology and work, race, gender, ideology, and more.
