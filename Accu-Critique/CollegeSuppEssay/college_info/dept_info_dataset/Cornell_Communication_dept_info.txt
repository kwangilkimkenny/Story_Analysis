Major: Communication


Tackle challenges as diverse as the world itself
Communication, in one form or another, has been a core part of the social sciences at Cornell since its founding. Students in the Department of Communication learn to understand audiences, shape messages and interact with individuals and technologies. Through the study of science, media and technology, you’ll develop essential skills for leading in the rapidly changing communication landscape.  

Communication is a process engaged in by people, between people and with the aim of influencing people. It happens inside of real social contexts: communities, organizations, teams, nations, societies. It happens with the aid of information technologies that are themselves a product of the social world. 

As a Communication student, you’ll gain the theoretical strength and methodological rigor of the social sciences, and get to learn—even take part in—grounded, empirical research about some of the most pressing social issues of the day.
