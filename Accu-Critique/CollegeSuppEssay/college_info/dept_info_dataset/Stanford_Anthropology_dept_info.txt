Department: Department of Anthropology
Major: Anthropology

Anthropology is devoted to the study of human beings and human societies as they exist across time and space. It is distinct from other social sciences in encompassing both the full span of human history and the full range of human societies and cultures, including those located in historically marginalized areas of the world. As a result, anthropology is especially attuned to questions of social, cultural, and biological diversity and to issues of power, identity, and inequality. Education in Anthropology provides excellent preparation for living and working in a multicultural and globally-interconnected world.  It equips students for careers in a wide range of fields, including law, medicine, business, public service, environmental sustainability, and resource management. Students may pursue degrees in Anthropology at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels.

The Department of Anthropology offers a wide range of approaches to the topics and area studies within the field, including archaeology, ecology, environmental anthropology, evolution, linguistics, medical anthropology, political economy, science and technology studies, and sociocultural anthropology. Methodologies for the study of micro- and macro-social processes are taught through the use of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The department provides students with excellent training in theory and methods to enable them to pursue graduate study in any of the above mentioned subfields of Anthropology.
