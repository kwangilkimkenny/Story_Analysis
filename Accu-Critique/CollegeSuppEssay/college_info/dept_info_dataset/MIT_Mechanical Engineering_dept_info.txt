School Name: MIT
Department: Mechanical Engineering
Major: Mechanical Engineering

We seek to produce future leaders for industry, academia, government, and society -- leaders whose vision is founded upon fundamental knowledge, analytical skills, creativity, perspective, and ethics. We seek to advance technology and science by combining basic knowledge with the innovative application of engineering and scientific principles. And we seek to enrich our educational and research programs, and ultimately society, through service.

From Macro to Nano, And Everything In Between
Mechanical Engineering is a versatile and interdisciplinary field that includes everything from nano engineering at the smallest scales – down to one-thousandth the size of a human hair – to the biggest systems, such as those for large-scale manufacturing or water desalination. We bring our signature passion, creativity, and rigor to bear on the world’s greatest challenges, for example:

Ocean engineering research projects range from flow sensors inspired by the whiskers of seals to fleets of autonomous underwater vehicles.

Energy engineering research projects range from thermoelectric devices that turn waste heat into electricity to the development of lithium air batteries that could extend the range of electric cars significantly.

Robotic engineering research projects range from a bio-inspired robotic cheetah that can run untethered to robots that can switch from hard to soft to squeeze through tight spaces, then back to hard to pick something up and throw it.
