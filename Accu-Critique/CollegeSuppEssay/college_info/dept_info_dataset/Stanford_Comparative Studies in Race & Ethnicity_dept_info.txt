School Name: Stanford
Department: Center for Comparative Studies in Race & Ethnicity
Major: Comparative Studies in Race & Ethnicity

Our Mission: To foster evidence-based teaching and research that advances racial justice through the comparative understanding of race.
The CSRE major itself has evolved over the years. As a program, CSRE intends to cultivate in students a knowledgeable understanding of race and ethnicity, how these categories are, and have been, formed throughout history, and most importantly how they affect the daily lives of individuals and communities in the United States and across the world.
In the current moment, as in the past, it is essential for everyone to understand the dynamics of race and ethnicity.  Such knowledge is required to participate in a diverse democracy. Across the globe, race and ethnicity are relevant to every dimension of social, political and economic life. Issues such as affordable housing; media, artistic representation, education,health care; incarceration,immigration, sexuality, religion, and economic development are concerned critically with the study of race and ethnicity.
