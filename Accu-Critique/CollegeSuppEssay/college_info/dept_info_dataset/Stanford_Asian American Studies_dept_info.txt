Started in 1997, the Asian American Studies Major and Minor offer students interdisciplinary analytical tools to actively study and research the Asian American experience. Asian American Studies classes cover a broad selection of topics and are offered in departments ranging from History to English to Music, representing the breadth of interests among our diverse faculty members. Whether you are a declared Asian American Studies major or simply interested in learning more, we hope you will find some useful information on what we are, who we are, what we teach, and what some of our alumni have done with a degree in Asian American Studies.

Asian American Studies (AAS) provides an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the historical and current experiences of persons of Asian ancestry. AAS faculty recognize that the term seeks to name a rapidly developing, complex, and heterogeneous population and that there is neither a single Asian American identity nor one community that comprises all Asian Americans. Asian Americans include those with ancestral ties to countries or regions in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, or the Philippines, among others.

AAS brings together courses that address the artistic, historical, humanistic, political, and social dimensions of Asian Americans and is an appropriate course of study for students interested in a variety of concerns related to Asian Americans, including: artistic and cultural contributions; current social significance; historical experiences; immigration, intellectual, and policy issues; relationships with other social groups; and the construction of the notion of Asian American as it addresses important theoretical and practical issues.
