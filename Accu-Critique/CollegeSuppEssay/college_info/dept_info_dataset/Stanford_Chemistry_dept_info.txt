Come and explore the molecular frontier. Humankind’s ever-developing scientific knowledge and technology rely heavily on chemistry, with molecular advances opening new vistas in medicine, biology, materials science, physics, energy, geology and environmental science, to name a few. In the Stanford Chemistry Department, we study all manners of atomic and molecular systems, create new forms of matter, and develop experimental and theoretical tools to understand and control the behavior of electrons, atoms, molecules and materials – to the benefit of science and society. In addition to our role providing foundational scientific knowledge, Chemistry’s natural synergy with other sciences leads our faculty and students into fascinating exchanges across disciplines, across campus and around the globe.
