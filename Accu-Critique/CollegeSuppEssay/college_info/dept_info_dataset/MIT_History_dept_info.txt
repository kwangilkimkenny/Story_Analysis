School Name: MIT
Department: History
Major: History (Course 21H)

History is the study of the recorded past. Since interest in the past is closely linked with a desire to understand the present, the history curriculum at MIT is tailored in part to put the modern world in historical perspective. Subjects explore the social, cultural, economic, and political transformations that shape the present; and efforts are made to suggest where traditional assumptions remain in present-day politics, society, and culture.

The curriculum seeks to encourage both an understanding of the human past and the development of skills necessary to express that knowledge effectively.
