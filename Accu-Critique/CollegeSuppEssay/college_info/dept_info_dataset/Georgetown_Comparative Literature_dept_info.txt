School Name: Georgetown
Department: Comparative Literature Program
Major: Comparative Literature

The Comparative Literature major, part of the Faculty of Languages and Linguistics at Georgetown University, offers undergraduates the unique opportunity to acquire expertise in two or more linguistic, literary and cultural traditions, to examine their connections, and to develop strong analytical, critical and writing skills through a cogent yet flexible program tailored to the studentsâ€™ individual academic interests.

Comparative Literature fosters the study of literary relations across national, linguistic, cultural, and temporal boundaries, and examines literature in its interaction with other cultural forms. Its ultimate goal is an understanding of literary and cultural productions as global phenomena. The comparative approach promotes an investigation of the nature and role of literature by exploring its multifaceted output, by focusing on connections, exchanges, analogies and differences between works, authors, periods or genres, and by engaging literature in a dialogue with other disciplines, from history and politics, sociology, linguistics and translation studies through philosophy, visual arts, music and film studies.

Renowned for its international orientation and its liberal arts tradition, its openness to multicultural initiatives, and its first-rate foreign language teaching and study abroad programs, Georgetown University is an ideal place for students interested in a comparative and interdisciplinary approach to literatures and cultures.

Our enviable location in Washington D.C. provides a rich variety of additional cultural, intellectual and service opportunities in the domain of foreign languages, literatures and cultures, through such venues as embassies, national cultural institutes, international organizations, and a broad array of museums, theaters, cinemas, and concert programs that bring together traditions and lifestyles from all over the world.

We hope that this web resource will help you become acquainted with the discipline of Comparative Literature and with our program. For any questions please feel free to contact the Director, Professor Susanna Lee.
