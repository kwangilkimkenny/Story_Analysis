School Name: MIT
Department: Chemical Engineering
Major: Chemical Engineering

Formally established as a separate department in 1920, MIT’s Chemical Engineering department (ChemE) has not only set the standard for instruction and research in the field, it continues to redefine the discipline’s frontiers. With one of three undergraduate programs focusing on chemical-biological engineering for students interested in the emerging biotech and life sciences industries, and two of three graduate programs providing an experiential course of study in chemical engineering practice in collaboration with MIT’s Sloan School of Management, ChemE at MIT is quite unlike chemical engineering anywhere else.

The mission of the MIT’s Chemical Engineering Department comprises three key areas:
Education, Research, Social responsibility

This degree is intended for the student who seeks a broad education in the application of chemical engineering to a variety of specific areas, including energy and the environment, nanotechnology, polymers and colloids, surface science, catalysis and reaction engineering, systems and process design, and biotechnology. The degree requirements include the core chemical engineering subjects with a chemistry emphasis, and the opportunity to add subjects in any of these application areas.
