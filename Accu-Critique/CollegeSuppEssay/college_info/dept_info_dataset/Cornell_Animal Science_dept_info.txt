Make a meaningful impact through animal science
Spark discoveries and disseminate new knowledge about the biology and management of domestic animals and put our knowledge to work to make a positive impact in the world. Animal Science offers undergraduate and graduate programs on the biology and management of food, laboratory and companion animal species.

Our goals are to discover and develop new techniques and information to benefit animals, agriculture and human health. The department’s 19 faculty members, many internationally recognized, have diverse interests in animal management, breeding, genetics, physiology, nutrition, growth biology and microbiology.

Major in Animal Science
Bachelor of Science (B.S.)

The Animal Science major prepares students for study in veterinary medicine or careers in animal production, biotechnology and conservation and has been nationally recognized for its work in animal breeding and genetics, nutrition, physiology, growth, behavior and management. Join students and professors who go beyond the classroom to explore ideas and tackle some of the complex challenges of our times. You’ll be prepared to find positions immediately upon graduation, or enter a graduate or professional school to obtain an advanced degree.

Program Overview
The animal sciences major offers an opportunity to apply animal biology, biochemistry, molecular biology and other life sciences to the study of animal breeding and genetics, nutrition, physiology, growth, behavior and management. The curriculum is extremely flexible and can be applied to a great variety of species, from farm animals and pets to laboratory animals and even some exotics. Students are encouraged, with the help of a faculty advisor, to plan an individual curriculum that suits their interests and career goals.
