School Name: Georgetown
Department: Walsh School of Foreign Service
Major: International Political Economy

The International Political Economy (IPEC) major investigates the rich intersection between economics and politics in the global environment. It typically goes beyond the constituent disciplines by combining traditional economic concerns about efficiency with traditional political concerns regarding distributional issues and legitimacy in market and non-market environments. The resulting combination of insights provides a means of a better understanding of complex interactions at the local, national and international levels.
