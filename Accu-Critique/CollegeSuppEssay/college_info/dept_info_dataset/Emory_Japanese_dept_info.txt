Major: Japanese 

The Department of Russian and East Asian Languages and Cultures (REALC) is an interdisciplinary department dedicated to the study of languages and cultures in the geographic continuum from Eastern Europe through Eastern Asia.
While REALC courses focus on some of the oldest civilizations in the world, the department houses classroom facilities that are equipped with the latest technology. Instructors make use of a range of media such as real-time television broadcasts from abroad, the Internet, and videoconferencing. This enables REALC to host interactive exchange with students and scholars in Russia and East Asia. The department sponsors various exciting and challenging study abroad programs, and special internship opportunities both overseas and in the Atlanta area. A wide variety of films, guest speakers, and special cultural events accompany our course work. REALC participates in the interdepartmental Center for Russian and East European Studies (REES) and the East Asian Studies Program (EASP), and also collaborates extensively with other departments and programs, including Linguistics, Comparative Literature, Art History, Film Studies, the Institute of Liberal Arts, Women's Studies, Theater, Music, History, and Religion. REALC courses are recommended for majors in the humanities as well as for students interested in developing a base upon which to understand international and global issues, Pacific Rim studies, and East-West relations. As dynamics become more internationalized and globalized, employers increasingly consider foreign language and experience of other cultures to be distinctive assets. REALC courses and programs offer structured, supportive opportunities for students to acquire such skills. Students with a background in Russian and East Asian languages and cultures go on to international careers, to graduate studies, or to programs in law, business, public health, or medicine. Because new courses continually are being added, please check the departmental website (www.realc.emory.edu) or call the department at 404.727.6427 for updated offerings. Also, students should contact the department for updated information about major and minor requirements and study abroad opportunities.
