A broad foundation in theoretical and practical studies, and intensive performance and design practical Studies; Students explore theater as a contemporary artistic practice within an intellectually rich continuum of traditions in the performing arts. We teach theater arts as a mode of inquiry into self and society with the conviction that such inquiries become the vehicle for a transformation of one or both. Interdisciplinary in its philosophy and humanist at its core, the program in theater arts is committed to a rigorous and innovative course of study across a diverse spectrum of creative forms.
