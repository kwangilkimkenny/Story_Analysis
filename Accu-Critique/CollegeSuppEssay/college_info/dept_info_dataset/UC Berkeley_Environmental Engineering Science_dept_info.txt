School Name: UC Berkeley
Department: Environmental Engineering Science
Major: Environmental Engineering Science

About the Program
Bachelor of Science (BS)

The environmental engineering science (EES) major is an interdisciplinary program pairing engineering fundamentals with courses in the environmental and natural sciences. The EES curriculum provides a broader foundation in the sciences, allowing students to take classes in a variety of departments both inside and outside of the College of Engineering. At the same time, it allows students to focus their studies on environmental issues more than is possible in other engineering programs. EES provides a solid interdisciplinary foundation that is necessary for creating real-world solutions to global environmental challenges, such as providing a robust supply of safe drinking water, and meeting societal demands for energy without causing air pollution or interfering with the Earthâ€™s climate systems.

Admission to the Major

Prospective undergraduates of the College of Engineering must apply for admission to one specific major/degree program. For further information, please see the College of Engineering's website.

Admission to engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is very competitive as there are few spaces open in engineering each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the College's website.
