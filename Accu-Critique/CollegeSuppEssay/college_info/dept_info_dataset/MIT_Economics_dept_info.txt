School Name: MIT
Department: Economics
Major: Economics (Course 14-1)


The undergraduate major in economics begins with a two-semester introductory sequence that explores theoretical and applied topics in microeconomics and macroeconomics. Additional training in microeconomics, macroeconomics, statistics, and econometrics follows. Majors have a choice of additional applied and advanced courses drawn from a menu that includes economic development, economic theory, health economics, industrial organization, international economics, labor economics, monetary economics, public economics, and other courses. The level of mathematics mastery among undergraduates allows economics courses to be taught at a high level.

The aims of the SB in Economics degree program are threefold: to give students a firm grounding in modern economic theory and a basic understanding of economic processes; to provide a descriptive knowledge of the US and world economies; and to develop in students the capabilities for quantitative analysis and independent thought. These aims correspond roughly to the requirements in the Course 14-1 program of theory, electives, statistics and econometrics, and research.
