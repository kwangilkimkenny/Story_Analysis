The undergraduate program gives students a grounding in the language, literature, and culture. Courses provide practical instruction in the French and Italian languages, the literatures and cultures of France and Italy in all periods, and literature in French written in other parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.

The graduate program trains students to become effective teachers and scholars of French language and literature. (The department does not offer a graduate program in Italian though it does teach graduate-level courses in Italian literature.)
