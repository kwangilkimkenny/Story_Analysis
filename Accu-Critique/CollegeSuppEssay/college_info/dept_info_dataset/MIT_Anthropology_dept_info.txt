Major: Anthropology (Course 21A)

Anthropology is the comparative study of human cultures, how customary ideas, actions, and institutions shape and give meaning to individual and collective experience. MIT Anthropology faculty conduct research all over the world, from Mexico to Mongolia, and within the United States. We live and work among the people we study, participating in daily activities and rituals, conducting interviews, and using multimedia tools such as photography and videography to collect data. We analyze how social identities and hierarchies are established or contested, cultural values are transmitted and transformed, and community and state organizations operate. We bring together expertise in such topics as magic and ritual, migration and race, medicine and health, family and gender, class and inequality, globalization and development, science and technology, food and eating, language, and material culture and urban environments. Our program provides students with training in field methods and social theory, critical thinking skills, and cross-cultural understanding.
