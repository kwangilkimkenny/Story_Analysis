School Name: Stanford
Department: Biology
Major: Biology

The Biology Department is at the center of life sciences research at Stanford. Our mission is to lead in understanding life, from molecules to cells, and organisms to ecosystems. The Biology faculty are committed to excellence in research and education, and are proud of the outstanding students and staff who make this possible. It is an exciting time to be a biologist - join us!

The Bachelor of Science is intended for students wishing to study biology, enter medical school, attend a graduate program in the sciences, or get started in research. The undergraduate minor is intended for students with an interest in Biology, but only enough time to complete a few courses.

Biology is a diverse and exciting field. Both as preparation for specific professional careers and as the focus of a general liberal arts curriculum, a major in Biology is an excellent choice for many Stanford students. The Biology major can serve as a stepping-stone for a wide variety of career opportunities, such as medical, dental, or veterinary school, or for a graduate program in the biological and applied sciences. It can also serve as a valuable and satisfying focus of a liberal arts education for those not planning careers in science-related fields.
