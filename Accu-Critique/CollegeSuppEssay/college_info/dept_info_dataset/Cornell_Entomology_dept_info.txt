School Name: Cornell
Department: College of Agriculture and Life Sciences
Major: Entomology


Home to the first entomology department in the country, CALS' undergraduate entomology major offers innumerable opportunities to study the basic and applied aspects of the field, while gaining a broad education in the biological and environmental sciences. 

Join research that spans the globe and impacts human lives on many levels, influencing a broad range of disciplines including human and veterinary medicine, farming, biodiversity and genomics.

The Entomology major provides an education in biological and environmental sciences, with a special emphasis on insects. Students in this major are not just fascinated by the most diverse group of animals on Earth; they understand that research in entomology is critical to human lives. For example:

Many serious diseases across the world are spread by insects; finding cures to these diseases will require a detailed understanding of insect biology.
A number of physiological processes—such as neurobiological systems—can be studied more easily in insects than in mammals.
Insects have evolved solutions to problems that still confound engineers. Examining the functional morphology of insects has helped inspire better designs of everything from robots to solar panels.

The entomology curriculum prepares you for a wide range of options after graduation, including the pursuit of graduate studies in entomology or related sciences upon completion of the B.S. degree.

Alternatively, students may immediately begin careers in various aspects of basic or applied insect biology including integrated pest management, insect pathology, environmental assessment, medical or veterinary entomology, insect toxicology, apiculture, insect systematics or insect ecology. Because of the diversity of career options, the major includes flexibility among the core requirements and electives that can be selected by students in consultation with their advisors.

Learning Outcomes
Students will be able to:

•     Think critically and use principles and modes of analysis in chemistry, physics and mathematics.

•     Design basic statistical analyses and evaluate basic statistical information.

•     Apply and judge the scientific method in conducting inquiry-based research in the laboratory and in the field.

•     Be able to critically evaluate information in primary research articles in entomology.

•     Apply concepts and analytical approaches in evolutionary biology, genetics and two other areas of biology of the student’s choice.

•     Demonstrate phylogenetic “tree thinking” and be able to categorize insects based on basic ecological, behavioral, morphological, physiological or developmental attributes.

•     Examine insects and other arthropods deeply within a biological level of analysis, and compare strategies used by different groups.

•     Identify the potential impact of different insect species on agriculture, human health and society in general, and be knowledgeable about potential control strategies.

•     Locate, comprehend and synthesize information important for informed decisions about broader issues  in our society.

•     Effectively communicate in written, oral and graphical form.
