School Name: Cornell
Department: College of Agriculture and Life Sciences
Major: Biometry and Statistics


Tackling the life sciences from a new perspective
Biometry is the application of statistics, mathematics, computing and other quantitative methods to phenomena and problems in the life sciences. Statistics is concerned with many aspects of scientific investigations: developing and studying the design and measurement aspects of investigations, executing investigations and collecting numerical information, summarizing the data obtained, and making inferences from the data.

Students learn how to use statistics, mathematics, computing, and other methods to solve problems in diverse fields, from the life and social sciences to business and finance.

Students enter the Biometry and Statistics major as freshmen or as transfer students. A strong background in mathematics is highly recommended for students considering a major in Biometry and Statistics. Students currently enrolled as freshmen or sophomores at other institutions who are considering transferring to the Biometry and Statistics program are encouraged to satisfy as many of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) distribution requirements as possible before transferring.
