School Name: Georgetown
Department: Department of Linguistics
Major: Linguistics


The Linguistics Department at Georgetown is committed to analyzing a diversity of linguistic phenomena through different modes of inquiry. We examine language through its structure, acquisition, use in context, and via computational models. By valuing the legitimacy and relevance of research at every level of analysis, and acknowledging that no one model of language can provide all the answers (or even address all the pertinent questions), we provide a foundation of linguistic study in a department that is built upon a tradition of unique pluralism.

The Linguistics Department offers a major in Linguistics, a minor in Linguistics, a Senior Honor’s Thesis, and a five-year Accelerated Bachelor/Master’s program. It also participates in the Interdisciplinary Minor in Cognitive Science, allowing students to combine the study of language with the broader study of the human mind. Courses in Linguistics also satisfy the social science general education requirement.
