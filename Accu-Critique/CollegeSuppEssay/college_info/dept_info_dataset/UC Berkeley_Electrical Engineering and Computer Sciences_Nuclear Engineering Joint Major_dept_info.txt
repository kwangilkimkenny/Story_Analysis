School Name: UC Berkeley
Department: Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences/Nuclear Engineering Joint Major
Major: Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences/Nuclear Engineering Joint Major

About the Program
Bachelor of Science (BS)

The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. 

The electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)/nuclear engineering (NE) joint major combines the traditional electrical engineering (EE) program with one in the nuclear sciences. Nuclear engineering shares with electrical engineering a concern for electrical power generation, automatic control, computer sciences, and plasmas.

Admission to the Joint Major

Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times during their academic programs. Please see the College of Engineering joint majors website for complete details.
