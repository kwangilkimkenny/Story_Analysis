At the undergraduate level, our students become not only fluent speakers, but competent writers and interpreters of a broad range of texts and cultural forms. Our language programs serve studentsâ€™ abilities and schedules with a choice between intensive and non-intensive courses. Students are also guaranteed continuity: we offer several sections of every language course every semester.
In contrast to many Spanish and Portuguese units at peer institutions, we have an ever growing number of students in advanced and upper-level Spanish and Portuguese courses. These students come from all areas of the university: the School of Foreign Service, the McDonough School of Business, and the School of Nursing and Health Sciences
