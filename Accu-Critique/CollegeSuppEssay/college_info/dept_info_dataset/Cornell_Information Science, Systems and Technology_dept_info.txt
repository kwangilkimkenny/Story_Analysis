Information Science Website  offers options for study among a variety of fields, so that our students can create unique connections between disciplines and come up with an individualized course of study during their time in the program.
We offer three undergraduate degrees in Information Science.

Students can pursue a Bachelor of Arts degree in Information Science through the College of Arts & Sciences (BA-IS) or a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Science through the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) (BS-IS). These two degree programs are very similar, differing primarily in their associated college-level requirements.

In addition, the department offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Science, Systems, and Technology (ISST) to students in the College of Engineering (BS-ISST). This degree differs substantially from the A&S and CALS Information Science programs.
