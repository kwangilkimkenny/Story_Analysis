School Name: Georgetown
Department: Walsh School of Foreign Service
Major: Culture and Politics

The Culture and Politics (CULP) major is an interdisciplinary program that empowers students to craft their own thematic concentrations rooted in questions of culture, knowledge, and power. Students will gain a complex understanding of these terms, their histories, and effects. We approach politics as mediated by cultural practices, and culture as suffused with power. The CULP major fosters an environment for critical inquiry, creative engagement, and collaborative learning.
