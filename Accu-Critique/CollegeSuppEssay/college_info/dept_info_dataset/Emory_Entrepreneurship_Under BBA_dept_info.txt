The Entrepreneurship depth provides multi-disciplinary immersion into the intricacies of launching a new venture. The depth allows students with immediate entrepreneurial aspirations to develop and operationalize their concepts. For those whose entrepreneurial intentions are more long-term, the depth offers the foundational knowledge and skills needed to understand and evaluate start-ups.

A range of largely-experiential courses across all academic disciplines provides students with hands-on opportunities to both work on projects of their own choosing and to partner with existing entrepreneurs. Concepts covered build the ability to conceive of and test ideas, identify markets and engage in customer discovery, utilize appropriate technologies as both venture platforms and back-end infrastructure, create sustainable competitive strategies, develop proformas and calculate valuation, and understand venture capital and other sources of funding. Faculty make use of both traditional and emerging pedagogical approaches to provide students with the most robust learning experience.
