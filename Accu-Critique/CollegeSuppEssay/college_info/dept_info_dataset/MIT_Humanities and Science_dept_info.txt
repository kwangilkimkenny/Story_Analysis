School Name: MIT
Department: Interdepartmental / Humanities, Science
Major: Humanities and Science (Course 21S)

This joint degree program draws from both humanistic and scientific studies, providing students with a basic command of each mode of inquiry. One component is selected from the undergraduate degree curriculum of a science department, which is approved by a faculty member in the field. The other component consists of subjects in a humanities field, chosen by the student in consultation with an advisor from the appropriate humanities faculty. This arrangement yields a humanities program of considerable depth while allowing for continued serious commitment to a scientific interest. In most cases, a senior thesis or sequence of advanced seminars is also required.
