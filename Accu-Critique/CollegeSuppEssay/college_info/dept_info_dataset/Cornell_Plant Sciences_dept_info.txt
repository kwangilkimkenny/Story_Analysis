School Name: Cornell
Department: College of Agriculture and Life Sciences
Major: Plant Sciences


Plant Sciences is the study of plant growth, reproduction, evolution, and adaptation, as well as the use of plants for food, fiber, and ornamental purposes. 

Majoring in Plant Sciences will help you make a positive difference in the world. Plant science expertise is needed to address many of our most challenging problems:

Producing enough food for a growing world population.
Breeding plants to tolerate the heat- and drought-stress caused by climate change.
Developing sustainable cropping practices to produce healthful and nutritious food.
Investigating new methods to fight plant diseases.
Restoring damaged ecosystems to better support those who live there.
Conserving species, through plant collections in gardens and arboretums, for future generations.

Learning Outcomes
•    Use major concepts and principles from multiple areas of life science to explain plant-related phenomena.

•    Describe plant biology at genetic, molecular, physiological and organismal levels to integrate plant functionalities in a hierarchical manner, from individual cells to the biosphere.

•    Discuss evolution as the foundation of all biological systems, and integrate evolutionary biology to describe patterns of plant diversity and ecological interaction.

Contribute to the expansion of the plant science knowledge base in the modern era

•    Formulate original questions about plants and translate these into empirically testable hypotheses.

•    Collect and analyze data obtained from original research using methods that are reproducible.

•    Translate and apply experimental data to advance the field and solve real-world problems.

Articulate the influences of plant science on the world

•    Discuss natural and managed ecosystems at local, regional and global levels, and evaluate their effects on environmental sustainability and human health.

•    Demonstrate an awareness of the ethical principles and global consequences associated with past, present and future advances in plant science.

•    Succinctly and clearly communicate information about the breadth of issues in plant science to diverse audiences in oral and written formats.
