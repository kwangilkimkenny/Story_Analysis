Faculty teach not only poetry, prose and drama, but film, music, art, architecture and technology. The department is united by a passion for works of the imagination, and for thinking about what they mean and the difference they make in the world.
The graduate program produces well-trained and field-transforming scholars, insightful and imaginative critics, and effective and creative teachers.
