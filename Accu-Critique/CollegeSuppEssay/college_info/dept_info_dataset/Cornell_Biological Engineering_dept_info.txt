The biological revolution of this century has given rise to a growing demand for engineers who can tackle local, national, and global challenges by combining the power of engineering principles with the ever-evolving science of biology. If you have a strong aptitude for math and the sciences and an interest in solving engineering problems that relate to living systems, Biological Engineering (BE) at Cornell is definitely worth investigating. 
Major in Biological Engineering
Bachelor of Science (B.S.)

Our program emphasizes problem solving and design though biological engineering. You’ll be ready to keep pace in a constantly evolving field by developing a thorough grounding in engineering fundamentals and a broad grasp of modern biology. Your coursework will build on a base of seven core BE courses and as well as a wide range of electives. You’ll also find opportunities throughout the program to practice the soft skills of teamwork and technical communication needed in the modern engineering workplace. 

Program Overview
The Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering offers a bachelor degree program in Biological Engineering. Strong emphasis is placed on mathematics, the physical and biological sciences and engineering analysis and design. The Biological Engineering program in BEE follows the academic requirements of the Cornell College of Engineering.
•     Identify, formulate and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science and mathematics.

•     Apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental and economic factors.

•     Communicate effectively with a range of audiences in written, oral and visual modes.

•     Recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.

•     Function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.

•     Develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.

•     Acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.

•     Demonstrate a working knowledge of chemistry and biology.

•     Apply their knowledge of engineering to biological systems.
Core Topics
Core topics in Biological Engineering program include molecular and cellular principles, chemical and enzyme kinetics, thermodynamics, transport of water and energy, and biomaterials. The science core of the program includes mathematics, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and introductory and advanced biology. Beyond these there are electives to be chosen from several areas including biomaterials, nanobiotechnology, ecological and microbial systems, modeling and simulation, synthetic biology, molecular and cellular systems, and sustainability. Throughout the curriculum, emphasis is placed on communication and teamwork skills. All students participate in a major design experience near the end of the curriculum.
