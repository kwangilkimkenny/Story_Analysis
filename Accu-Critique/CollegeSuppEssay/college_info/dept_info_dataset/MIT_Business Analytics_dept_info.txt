At the intersection of business and technology, weâ€™re exploring the future of work. For students, this means different kinds of opportunities. Hands-on learning. Global experience. And a relentless focus on impact.

The Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics program is for students with a strong interest and ability in math and computer science. Students learn techniques such as data modeling and analysis, optimization, and machine learning, so as to help businesses make improved decisions and design efficient processes. Electives provide the opportunity to learn additional methodologies, such as artificial intelligence, systems dynamics, and game theory; take advanced subjects in probability, statistics, and optimization; or study how analytics is applied in content areas such as operations, transportation, marketing, and finance. Students can also refine their skills in practice-based project courses.
