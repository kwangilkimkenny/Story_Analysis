School Name: MIT
Department: Chemical Engineering
Major: Chemical-Biological Engineering

Formally established as a separate department in 1920, MIT’s Chemical Engineering department (ChemE) has not only set the standard for instruction and research in the field, it continues to redefine the discipline’s frontiers. With one of three undergraduate programs focusing on chemical-biological engineering for students interested in the emerging biotech and life sciences industries, and two of three graduate programs providing an experiential course of study in chemical engineering practice in collaboration with MIT’s Sloan School of Management, ChemE at MIT is quite unlike chemical engineering anywhere else.

Bachelor of Science as Recommended by the Department of Chemical Engineering (Course 10-C) The curriculum for students in Course 10-C involves basic subjects in chemistry and chemical engineering. Instead of continuing in depth in these areas, students can add breadth by study in another field, such as another engineering discipline, biology, biomedical engineering, economics, or management. Course 10-C is attractive to students who wish to specialize in an area such as those cited above while simultaneously gaining a broad exposure to the chemical engineering approach to solving problems.
