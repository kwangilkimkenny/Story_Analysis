The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures offers a minor program in East European/Eurasian Languages and/or Cultures with emphases in Armenian, Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian, Czech, Hungarian, or Polish. Students who wish to major in these languages should consider the applicable program track available through the Slavic Languages and Literatures Department major program.

Declaring the Minor

Students considering a minor track involving language requirements must see the undergraduate student services adviser early on to have their minor study list plan reviewed and approved; referral for language proficiency screening, placement, and potential language course credit for heritage or native speakers is required. Final approval for a minor rests with the major adviser. The paperwork for the minor, called an L&S Confirmation of Minor form, is completed with the undergraduate student services adviser no later than the semester before the student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT).
