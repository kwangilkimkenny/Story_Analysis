The Art Practice program on both undergraduate and graduate levels offers production-based curriculum to prepare students for creative careers in the visual arts and hone their creative capabilities. Access to diverse courses and faculty, cross-disciplinary interaction, and well-equipped labs are among the strengths of the flexible program.
Students are exposed to a range of practices early in their development in order to have a solid basis for comparison if they choose to focus on a particular medium. This sequence of courses also broadens the studentsâ€™ skills and enables them to combine materials and methods. In all courses students are expected to pass mid term and final reviews and critiques of their work.
