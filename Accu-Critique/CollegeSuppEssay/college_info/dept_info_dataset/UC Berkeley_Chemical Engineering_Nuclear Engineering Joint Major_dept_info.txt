School Name: UC Berkeley
Department: Chemical Engineering/Nuclear Engineering Joint Major
Major: Chemical Engineering/Nuclear Engineering Joint Major

About the Program
Bachelor of Science (BS)

The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. The joint majors contain comparable proportions of coursework in both major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. Both majors are shown on the student's transcript of record. Students in this joint major program are concurrently enrolled in both the College of Engineering and the College of Chemistry, but their college of residence will be the College of Chemistry.

The areas of nuclear technology that depend heavily upon chemical engineering training include isotope separation, fuel reprocessing, waste management, feed material preparation, fuel chemistry, effluent control, fusion reactor fuel processing, and new reactor types.

Admission to the Joint Major

Students may petition for a change to a joint major program after their first year. For further details regarding how to declare the joint major, please contact the College of Chemistry.
