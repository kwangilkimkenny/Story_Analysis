School Name: MIT
Department: Chemistry
Major: Chemistry (Course 5)

MIT Chemistry course is designed to provide an education based on science, both for those who intend to go on to graduate study and those who intend to pursue a professional career immediately in either chemistry or an allied field, such as medicine, in which a sound knowledge of chemistry is important. Students receive thorough instruction in the principles of chemistry, supplemented by a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, biology, and the humanities. MIT Chemistry is taking a leading role in experimentally and theoretically probing chemistry at its most fundamental level, discovering new chemical syntheses, creating sustainable energy, unraveling the biochemical complexities of natural systems, improving the environment, detecting and curing disease, and developing materials with new properties. Fundamental discoveries made in our department have found their way into practical applications ranging from polymer synthesis to medical imaging.
