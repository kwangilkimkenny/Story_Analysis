School Name: Stanford
Department: School of Earth, Energy, and Environmental Sciences
Major: Earth Systems

As the largest undergraduate major within the School of Earth, we engage students who possess a wide range of interests, from understanding the way the Earth works, to promoting sustainability and conservation, developing engineering solutions to todayâ€™s global challenges, and communicating environmental science and policy. In fact, the Earth Systems Program has never been more relevant to the issues we face as a society in a fast-changing world, and as a university striving to support sustainable practices locally and globally.
