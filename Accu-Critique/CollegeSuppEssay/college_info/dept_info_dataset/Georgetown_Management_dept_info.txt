School Name: Georgetown
Department: McDonough School of Business
Major: Management

The management major is designed to inspire leadership and innovation by helping students:
• Develop the mindsets and skill sets necessary to succeed as individual contributors, team members, and leaders
in increasingly diverse global organizations, and in changing economic, cultural, social, and legal environments.
• Think and act more creatively and strategically to solve complex individual, team, and organizational problems,
and understand the ways in which individuals, teams, and organizations behave and change.
• Recognize their legal vulnerabilities and ethical responsibilities (to peers, employers, and society), grounded in
Georgetown’s mission and the Jesuit traditions of refection, care for the whole person, and service to others.
