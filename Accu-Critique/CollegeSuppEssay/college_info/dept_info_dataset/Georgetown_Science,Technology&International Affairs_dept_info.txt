School Name: Georgetown
Department: Walsh School of Foreign Service
Major: Science, Technology & International Affairs

The Science, Technology and International Affairs major aims to equip students with the tools needed to understand the complex problems at the intersection of scientific and technical issues and international affairs. The major combines work in the natural sciences with international affairs courses dealing with the environment, energy, business/economic development, information technology, and communications, health, and securityâ€”many of which are specially designed for this major program. STIA is the only SFS major to have a science requirement, and it provides SFS students with the option of continuing in science after graduation in fields such as the environmental and energy sciences and medicine. In this major students choose to concentrate their study in one of four areas: Environment and Energy; Business, Growth and Development; Biotechnology and Global Health; and Science, Technology and Security.
