School Name: UC Berkeley
Department: Chemical Engineering/Materials Science and Engineering Joint Major
Major: Chemical Engineering/Materials Science and Engineering Joint Major

About the Program
Bachelor of Science (BS)

The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. The joint majors contain comparable proportions of coursework in both major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. Both majors are shown on the student's transcript of record. Students in this joint major program are concurrently enrolled in both the College of Engineering and the College of Chemistry, but their college of residence will be Chemistry.

Many of the engineering problems facing the nation in the next decades will require solutions by engineers who have training in both chemical process engineering and materials engineering. Three typical examples are coal gasification and liquefaction, extraction of metals from low-grade ores and wastes, and environmental control of metallurgical processes.

Admission to the Joint Major

Admission to the joint major programs is closed to freshmen. Continuing students may petition for a change to a joint major program after their first year. For further details regarding how to declare the joint major, please contact the College of Chemistry.
