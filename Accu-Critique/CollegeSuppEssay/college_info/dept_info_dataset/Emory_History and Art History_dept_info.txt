The Department offers courses in the art and architecture of the ancient Americas, ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe, modern and contemporary Europe and the United States, and Africa; additional areas may be covered in courses cross-listed with other departments. The faculty is committed to working closely with undergraduates both in and out of the classroom. Our courses often make use of the varied collections at the Michael C.
