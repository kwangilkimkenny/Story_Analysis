Department: African American Studies
Major: African American Studies B.A.

examines the experiences and contributions of people of the African diaspora in the United States and globally. By studying the intellectual, historical, cultural, economic, political, religious, literary, scientific, and social ideas, institutions, movements and practices of African Americans, the department provides the tools to theorize solutions to social issues rooted in longstanding and persistent racial divides. We seek to apply those theories to bridge the gap between the classroom and community, particularly the diverse communities of Washington DC and beyond. The African American studies curriculum promotes the facultyâ€™s cultural competencies, critical faculties, and historical sensibilities and equips students for educational and career success.
