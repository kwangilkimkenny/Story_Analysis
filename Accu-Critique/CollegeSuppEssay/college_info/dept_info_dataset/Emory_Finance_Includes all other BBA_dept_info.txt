Finance
If accounting is the language of business, then finance is the science. Our goal in the Finance area is to provide you with a strong framework for financial decision making, from the Nobel Prize-winning models of the early theorists to the state-of-the-art methodologies of today. If you enjoy math and the sciences, you will likely enjoy the structured way of thinking in finance. An understanding of the principles and practice of finance is often essential for career development, particularly as graduates' responsibilities become more general in nature as they progress in their careers.

Businessweek recently rated Goizueta's BBA program #2 in the area of Financial Management, and our Finance track is consistently one of the top concentrations at Goizueta. The curriculum is carefully designed to equip you with the analytical skills and practical expertise necessary to excel in finance careers. Many students graduate to join banking firms on Wall Street, and other common career paths include corporate finance and investment management. Our course offerings also allow you to emphasize career tracks in real estate as well the growing areas of private equity, hedge funds, and new venture financing through Goizueta's Center for Alternative Investments.
