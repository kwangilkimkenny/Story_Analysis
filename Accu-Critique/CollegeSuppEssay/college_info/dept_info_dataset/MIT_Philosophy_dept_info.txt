School Name: MIT
Department: Linguistics and Philosophy
Major: Philosophy (Course 24-1)

We are one half of the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, established in 1976. Our 14 faculty have eclectic interests: apart from the standard fare in ethics, language, mind, and metaphysics, research includes philosophy of action, philosophy of science, feminist philosophy, social philosophy, philosophy of cognitive science, philosophy of sex/gender, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of race, Kant, philosophical logic, decision theory, philosophy of physics, and applied ethics. We have a highly-regarded Ph.D. program with about 25 graduate students, and a flourishing undergraduate program with options for a philosophy major, minor, or concentration.

This major is designed to provide familiarity with the history and current status of the main problems in epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics; mastery of some of the technical skills requisite for advanced work in philosophy; facility at independent philosophical study; and work at an advanced level in an allied field. A relatively large amount of unrestricted elective time is available so that students can devise programs suited to individual needs and interests.
