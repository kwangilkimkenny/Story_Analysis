At the intersection of business and technology, weâ€™re exploring the future of work. For students, this means different kinds of opportunities. Hands-on learning. Global experience. And a relentless focus on impact.

The Bachelor of Science in Management provides students with an innovative business education that is comprehensive and flexible. Students begin with coursework that builds a strong foundation in probability and statistics, managerial communication, managerial psychology, microeconomics, and accounting. They augment this foundation by selecting two restricted electives in core business functions: finance, operations management, marketing, and strategy. Students then tailor the remainder of their program by selecting five electives that go into depth in an individualized concentration area.
