School Name: Stanford
Department: Chemical Engineering
Major: Chemical Engineering

Countless industries depend on the synthesis and processing of chemicals and materials — on chemical engineering — for their existence. The chemical and energy industries are obvious examples, but advances in chemical engineering have led to new developments in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, in electronic device and materials fabrication, in water purification and environmental engineering, and more.

Our department focuses on making an impact on the key environmental, technological and biological questions of our time. We believe chemical engineering holds the key to a healthier, cleaner and more efficient world, and a better tomorrow for all.

To match our field’s new focus and widened potential, our department is undergoing a dynamic expansion organized along three distinct lines of strategic focus:
Chemistry of Life 
Chemistry of Energy
Chemistry of the Environment
