The Department of Psychology is located in White Gravenor Hall on the main campus of the university.

Research by Faculty in the Department of Psychology—from basic science investigations of behavior and brain function to applications for public policy—is directed at Georgetown University’s goal of creating and communicating knowledge in the service of the common good.

Our Undergraduate Program offers a Major and a Minor in Psychology and provides a variety of opportunities for scholarship and extracurricular enrichment, including the Psi Chi International Honor Society in Psychology, a research-focused Honors Program, and research assistantships and volunteer opportunities in Faculty labs.
