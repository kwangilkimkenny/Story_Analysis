School Name: Georgetown
Department: Theology & Religious Studies
Major: Theology B.A.

The department plays a significant role at all levels of the educational mission of Georgetown University. First, it serves the core curriculum with two required courses. The “Problem of God” and “Introduction to Biblical Literature” serve as alternate choices for the first mandatory course.
For much of Georgetown’s history, the study of religion took the form of religious instruction in Catholicism and was performed as part of the normal responsibilities of the Jesuit faculty.  The background in theology that was part of every Jesuit’s training was seen as sufficient to perform the task of religious instruction.  However, as the study in religion at Georgetown came to be seen as a serious academic enterprise, the training required for its instructors paralleled that of other departments; Ph.D.’s from universities took the place of seminary M.Div.’s and S.T.L.’s.  In addition, as the study of religion moved from simple instruction in Catholicism to a properly academic exploration, the department expanded its research focus to include diverse religious traditions.
