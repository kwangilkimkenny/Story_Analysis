About the Hotel School

We are pioneers—and we have been for more than 90 years. We venture through uncharted territory, clearing a path for the future of hospitality. Beginning in hotel operations in 1922 and growing to incorporate expertise in areas from food and beverage to real estate and finance, entrepreneurship, and labor and employment relations, we explore the most exotic places in travel and leisure, push the boundaries of knowledge and research, and invite the world to follow our path to discover and create the future of our industry.

Our mission is to create and disseminate knowledge about hospitality management through teaching, research, industry relations, and service.

When you study hospitality at the Cornell School of Hotel Administration (SHA), you get a full-bodied approach to business—and you find out it’s about so much more than hotels. Marketing, finance, real estate, operations, and more—we cover it all, pairing our exceptional focus within the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business with the breadth of global perspective afforded by the greater Cornell community. SHA will provide you an AACSB-accredited business degree with a focus on the world’s largest and most exciting industry, offering a sense of adventure and a wide range of rewarding careers.
