The Department of Art & Art History is an interdisciplinary department offering undergraduate and graduate degrees in art history, art practice, documentary filmmaking, and film studies.
Art History is a discipline that strives to understand works of art, architecture and design from a variety of perspectives, including the original context of their making and reception as well as their subsequent circulation, collection, conservation, and display.  As culturally embedded expressions, works of art may yield multiple meanings depending on the kinds of research and interpretive strategies that art historians bring into play.  These might include consultation of original archives, philosophical and critical discourses, as well as research into social history or formal analysis.
