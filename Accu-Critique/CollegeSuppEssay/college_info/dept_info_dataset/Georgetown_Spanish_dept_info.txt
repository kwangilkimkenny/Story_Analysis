School Name: Georgetown
Department: Department of Spanish and Portuguese
Major: Spanish


Spanish and Portuguese are indispensable languages of the Americas, Europe, and the world. Catalan’s reach is less extensive than Spanish and Portuguese, but is a critical language for understanding Spanish and European history. Join our exciting community of students, staff and faculty as we explore the literary, linguistic, and artistic diversity of people on every continent. If you came to Georgetown hoping to leave campus more attuned to the globalized currents of the present, past and future, our department is a place for you.

Take a class, consider a major, drop in the office hours of one of our world renowned professors, or perhaps just stop by a conversation hour and munch on a cookie while you’re at it…pick up a new language, improve an old one, learn why your own words take the forms and sequences that they do…learn about countries you know deeply already or barely know at all…read those books you always wanted to and discover new favorite authors along the way…plunge with gusto into familiar topics or find yourself in traditions and theories you never dreamed existed…and then leave us bolstered by whatever you have gained in our community to go and study abroad, volunteer locally, reach out to other communities, take your next steps in new places knowing that the paths you made here have created a map you can rely upon in the future.
