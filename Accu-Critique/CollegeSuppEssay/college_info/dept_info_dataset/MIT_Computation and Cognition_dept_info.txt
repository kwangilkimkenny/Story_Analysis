School Name: MIT
Department: Interdepartmental / Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brain and Cognitive Sciences
Major: Computation and Cognition (Course 6-9)

The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences offer a joint curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science in Computation and Cognition that focuses on the emerging field of computational and engineering approaches to brain science, cognition and machine intelligence. The curriculum provides flexibility to accommodate students with a wide diversity of interests in this areaâ€”from biologically-inspired approaches to artificial intelligence, to reverse engineering circuits in the brain. This joint program prepares students for careers that include advanced applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as further graduate study in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Students in the program are full members of both departments, with one academic advisor from each department.
As human brains increasingly interact with technology that mimics their own capabilities, the need for students to understand both the science and engineering of intelligence continues to grow as well. Addressing these challenges will require a deeper understanding of how the brain produces intelligent behavior and how we may be able to replicate intelligence in machines.
