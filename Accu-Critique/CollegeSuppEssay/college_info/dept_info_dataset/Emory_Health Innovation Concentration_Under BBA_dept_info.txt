The Concentration in Health Innovation is a collaborative effort between the Center for the Study of Human Health (CSHH) BA Program in Human Health in Emory College and the Goizueta Business School BBA Program. This concentration provides knowledge, competencies, and experiences for BA and BBA students interested in pursuing careers in a wide array of fields related to the business of health with a focus on innovation.

The Concentration in Health Innovation is open by application to business school students and Emory College students majoring in human health. During the junior and senior year, in addition to pursuing their own majors, students admitted to the concentration complete two core courses in the non-major program, two electives from a list of relevant choices, and one senior capstone. Additional seminars, industry speakers, internships, and field projects augment the resources available to concentration students.

BBA students who complete this concentration will gain an understanding of the cutting edge science of health with a focus on Emory areas of strength, including innovations in personalized medicine and health, applications and translations involved in global health, the science of nutrition and current challenges in changing dynamics within the medical system and health policy. Human health students who complete this concentration will acquire grounding in the basic principles of business including management, marketing and operations and will develop foundational business practices that will help them be better stewards of limited financial, human, and organizational resources.
