The civilization and cultural achievements of ancient Greece and Rome continue to influence our values, the way we think, and the questions we ask. They represent some of our deepest cultural roots and stand at the core of a liberal arts education. The Department of Classics offers students an opportunity to study the languages, literature, culture, and influence of classical antiquity. General courses include such topics as classical mythology, law, religion, women in antiquity, and Greek and Roman literature in translation. Most of these courses have no prerequisites, and several fulfill Emory College General Education Requirements. For students interested in Greek or Latin, language instruction is offered at all levels, from elementary to advanced, both in a classroom setting and in individualized instruction. The department offers several majors and two minors as well as joint majors with other departments. Students interested in integrating the study of Greece and Rome with other Mediterranean Civilizations are encouraged to consult the Program in Ancient Mediterranean Studies in which the Department of Classics is an active participant.
