School Name: Stanford
Department: 
Major: Urban Studies


An interdisciplinary, undergraduate program at Stanford that combines academic approaches with real-world experience to understand cities. If you've ever wondered why people live in cities (or suburbs), how the physical environment influences behavior, or how to address seemingly intractable problems like urban poverty, homelessness, or troubled schools, Urban Studies may be for you.

Cities are now home to more than half of humanity. The mission of the undergraduate program in Urban Studies is to develop students' understanding of the nature of cities and their impact on our world. The dynamic and complex nature of cities challenges traditional disciplinary boundaries, so our program is interdisciplinary in nature, drawing from fields in the social sciences, history, and education.
