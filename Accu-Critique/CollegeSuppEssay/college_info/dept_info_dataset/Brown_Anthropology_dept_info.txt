Medical Anthropology at Brown
Medical anthropology at Brown for concentrators and for PhD students 

The Department of Anthropology is home to a vibrant community of faculty, students, and staff broadly interested in the study of humanity, past and present. Brown's socio-cultural and linguistic anthropologists are engaged in ethnography across the globe. The department's anthropological archaeologists focus on the study of the material remains of the ancient, historic, and modern Americas.

Current faculty and students are especially engaged in research related to issues of power, violence, politics, health, and population.  The photographs found throughout this website were taken by our faculty, students, and alumni during their fieldwork.

The undergraduate concentration in Anthropology involves training in the four subfields of anthropology: socio-cultural anthropology, archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and biological anthropology. We offer a general track that draws from all of those, as well as tracks in each individual subfield and a track in medical anthropology, which bridges several of these subfields. Many of the department's courses are appropriate for non-concentrators and we encourage students from throughout the Brown community to take advantage of our courses and other programmatic offerings.
