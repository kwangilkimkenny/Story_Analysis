Department: Communication
Major: Communication

In the Department of Communication, we study the ways that communication techniques and technologies shape who we are, how we govern ourselves, and what kinds of cultures we inhabit.
Today the department remains strongly interdisciplinary. Its research faculty come from the fields of political science, psychology, sociology and economics, as well as communication. Its professional journalism faculty includes prize-winning innovators in digital storytelling and computational journalism, as well as former bureau chiefs for the New York Times and the Washington Post. And for ten months every year, the John S. Knight Journalism Fellowships program brings up to 20 journalists and journalism innovators from the U.S. and around the world to the Department to focus on innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership.
