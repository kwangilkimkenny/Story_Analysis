At the intersection of economics, strategy, and accounting, finance is about managing assets to keep markets and organizations operating. The Bachelor of Science in Finance is designed to train students for careers that focus on the theory and application of the tools of modern finance. The curriculum provides a theoretical foundation in managerial finance, corporate finance, and investments, and requires students to complete laboratory and communications subjects to ensure they have the ability to apply the tools of finance to industry. The restricted electives permit students flexibility to select the rest of their program from advanced topics in, and topics complementary to, finance.
