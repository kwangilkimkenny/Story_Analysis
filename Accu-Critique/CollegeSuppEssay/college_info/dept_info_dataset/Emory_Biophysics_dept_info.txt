School Name: Emory
Department: College of Arts and Sciences
Major: Biophysics

Emory physics majors are a close-knit group of students who enjoy a remarkably high degree of personal interaction with faculty members.  Class size for any course beyond the introductory level rarely exceeds twenty students, and it is usually smaller. All undergraduate courses, without exception, are taught by members of the faculty. The department's emphasis on teaching enables undergraduates to develop close working relationships with their professors that often result in exciting research and/or directed studies opportunities.
Majors have their own study lounge within the department adjacent to the kitchen available any time, around the clock. They are also encouraged to become active members of our chapter of the Society of Physics Students (SPS) where, during monthly meetings, they can relax, enjoy some pizza and explore a range of ideas. The department also fosters a sense of community through annual gatherings such as the Spring picnic, holiday party, and Fall welcome party for new graduate students.
The physics department provides majors and minors with a quiet and comfortable place to study within the Department. The Undergraduate lounge is located in room N229. It is adjacent to the DepartmentÂ¿s kitchen which you are also welcome to use. Please feel free to bring guests from physics classes with whom you are studying, but be sure to always accompany your guests and observe consideration for other students who need a quiet study area. All guests must be accompanied by a Physics major or minor. There are two computers set up with relevant software for your use. Please report any problems with them to Susan Cook in N248.
