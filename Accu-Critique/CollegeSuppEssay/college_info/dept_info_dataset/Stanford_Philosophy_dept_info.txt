Why Philosophy?
How do we know?  What is truth?  How are scientific claims justified?  Are we naturally good or evil?  Are we responsible for our actions?  How do human minds and bodies interact?  Do people have free will?  What is justice?
Philosophy embraces difficult questions and investigates fundamental concepts.
At Stanford, we believe that philosophy ought to be engaged and applied.
Critical reading. Analytical thinking. Sound argumentation.
