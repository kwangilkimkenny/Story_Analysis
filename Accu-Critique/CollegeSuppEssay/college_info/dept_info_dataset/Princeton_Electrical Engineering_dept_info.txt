Undergraduate students begin with a unifying foundation before studying in an area of specialization which ranges from devices to optoelectronics, to computer architecture and communication technology, to microprocessors. Students may select one of a set of suggested concentrations, or tailor their own in consultation with their faculty adviser to suit special interests.

The graduate program emphasizes forward-looking education and original, cutting-edge research. While addressing fundamental issues and applications, graduate research focuses on current high-growth fields like security, photonics, nanotechnology, quantum computing, biomedical applications, networks and communications, and multicore computer architecture.
