School Name: Princeton
Department: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
Major: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology


The undergraduate program emphasizes study from an evolutionary perspective, combining theory and empiricism and linking areas that are often treated as separate disciplines. Students with an interest in whole-organism and large-scale processes -- evolution, physiology, disease, behavior, neuroscience, ecology, ecosystem biology, conservation, and climate change -- will find a home in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.
Areas of strength in the graduate program include evolutionary ecology, behavioral ecology, theoretical ecology, population, community, and ecosystem ecology, ecological and evolutionary genetics, molecular evolution, epidemiology of infectious diseases, and conservation biology. Graduate students also have excellent opportunities for combining several areas for innovative interdisciplinary work.
