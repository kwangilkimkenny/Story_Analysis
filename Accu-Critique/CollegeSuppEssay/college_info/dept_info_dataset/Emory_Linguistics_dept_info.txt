EXAMPLES OF CLASSES
TOPICS IN SOCIOLINGUISTIC
In this overview course, you’ll explore how language changes due to social, geographic, historic, and situational variables.
LANGUAGE ACQUISITION
Understanding how we acquire language is crucial to understanding human behavior. In this course, which raises issues in both linguistics and psychology, you’ll examine how our brains are organized to process information and how language affects socialization, communication, and culture.
LANGUAGE, MIND & SOCIETY
Is language a product of how the mind works or of social interaction? In this course, you’ll use these two opposing views as context for examining the structure and limitations of language.
