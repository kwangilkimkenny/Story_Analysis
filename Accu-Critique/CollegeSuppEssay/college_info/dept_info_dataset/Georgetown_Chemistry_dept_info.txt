Major: Chemistry

Welcome to the Chemistry department at Georgetown University! We offer two separate undergraduate majors – a B.S. in Chemistry and a B.S. in Biochemistry. The department also offers a minor in Chemistry.

In addition to receiving coursework in each of the fundamental areas of chemistry/biochemistry, our majors have abundant opportunities to participate in undergraduate research. Undergraduates are encouraged to get involved in research as early as possible via enrolling in research courses, the GU Research Opportunities Program (GUROP), or even on a volunteer basis. For those students who wish to make a more serious multi-term commitment to undergraduate research, Honors degrees culminating in a senior thesis are offered for both majors.

The Chemistry major is fully accredited by the American Chemical Society (ACS). Students, who have earned a B.S. degree in Chemistry at Georgetown, are well-prepared for graduate study in Chemistry, Biochemistry, or other closely related scientific fields at any U.S. university, for medical school and M.D.-Ph.D. programs, for careers in industry, government, academia and research, and for many other opportunities (see our Learning Goals). With the inclusion of introductory biology, the curriculum provides an excellent background and all of the necessary prerequisites for Medical School admissions. The Biochemistry major curriculum also provides rigorous training suitable for Medical School admissions, graduate study in Biochemistry or graduate studies in any of the basic medical sciences. It is particularly well suited for students aspiring to M.D.­Ph.D. programs. Some of our recent graduates have also gone on directly to industrial, academic, or research careers, or to law schools and graduate schools of business.
