Electrical Engineering is a very broad, flexible major. For our undergraduate students, we organize the curriculum through three disciplinary areas: (I) Hardware and Software Systems, (II) Information Systems and Science, (III) Physical Technology and Science, and several interdisciplinary elective areas. Throughout the Bachelor of Science program, EE undergraduates will build all kinds of very cool, sophisticated systems. You will learn about a range of state-of-the-art electronics and devices, signal processing, smart algorithms, and a range of their applications in modern technology.
