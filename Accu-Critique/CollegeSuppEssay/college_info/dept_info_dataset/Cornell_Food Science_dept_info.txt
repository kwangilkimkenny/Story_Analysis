School Name: Cornell
Department: College of Agriculture and Life Sciences
Major: Food Science


Supplying an expanding global population with adequate food is one of the greatest challenges facing humankind in the 21st century. The Food Science major prepares you to lead change in the food industry, academia and government. Our research programs are designed to expand understanding of the biological/microbiological, chemical, physical, sensory, nutritional and engineering properties of foods and beverages. 

Major in Food Science
Bachelor of Science (B.S.)

In this program, you can gain skills and advance your knowledge so you can make meaningful contributions toward ensuring that all people have access to a safe, healthy, affordable and sustainable food supply. Our faculty and students are engaged in cutting-edge research designed to:

Identify and prevent outbreaks of foodborne illnesses.
Develop improved preservation methods to expand the available food supply.
Evaluate the role of fruit and vegetables in preventing cancer.
Reduce nutrient losses during processing, storage, and transport of foods.
Improve the effectiveness of food fortification.
Develop foods that may someday travel to other planets with astronauts.

Program Overview
The Food Science program prepares students for leadership positions in the food industry, academia and government.

Our research programs are designed to expand understanding of the biological/microbiological, chemical, physical, sensory, nutritional and engineering properties of foods and beverages.

Our extension and outreach programs transfer research-based information and technology to consumers, food and beverage companies and government agencies with the goal of enhancing the availability, quality and safety of our food supply.

Degree Emphases
Undergraduates in Food Science have the opportunity to choose from one of three degree emphases, which assist students in focusing their undergraduate program and matching their coursework to their interests. Whether students choose the Science Emphasis, Business Emphasis, or Safety Emphasis, every student in our program will get a strong foundation in the physical sciences and a thorough exposure to the various fields in Food Science. 

There are three paths available in the Food Science major:

Food Science provides an integrated curriculum that blends fundamental science with the more applied aspects of the science of foods. This option includes core courses in the microbiology and safety of foods, food processing and engineering, the chemistry of foods and food ingredients and sensory evaluation of foods.

Food Operations and Management deals with the principles and practices pertinent to efficient management of food processing, preservation, distribution and marketing operations. This option is offered to meet the needs of students that are more interested in the business or marketing side of the food industry.

Food Safety provides a comprehensive curriculum covering physical, chemical and biological hazards that affect the safety of foods while providing a solid background in applied food science.
