School Name: Stanford
Department: Center for Comparative Studies in Race & Ethnicity
Major: Native American Studies

The purpose of the Native American Studies major and minor is to introduce students to a broad range of approaches to the academic study of Native American people, history, and culture. Students who major in Native American Studies have the opportunity of doing advanced work in a number of related fields, including literature, sociology, education, and law.

In addition to specialized course work about Native American issues, students also are expected to concentrate in a traditional discipline such as History, Anthropology, or Psychology, to ensure they have a well-rounded educational experience. All courses in the program in some way promote the ongoing discussion of how academic knowledge about Native Americans relates to experiences of Native American people and communities.
