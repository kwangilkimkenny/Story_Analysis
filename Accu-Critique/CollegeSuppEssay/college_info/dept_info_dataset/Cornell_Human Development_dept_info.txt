School Name: Cornell
Department: College of Human Ecology
Major: Human Development


The Human Development major is a Bachelor of Science degree that prepares you for a career in medicine, law, business, child and family advocacy, social work and education, research or to become a professor of Human Development, Sociology, Psychology or Neuroscience.

Undergraduate students may become involved in research with the guidance of a faculty member by applying to join a lab. Students can earn credit while working on a faculty research project by enrolling in HD 4010, Empirical Research, (an undergraduate special studies course) with a chosen faculty member. 

Undergraduates may also conduct their own research as part of the HD Honors program, which is designed to give talented Human Development undergraduates the opportunity to formulate and carry out an independent research investigation under the supervision of a member of HD departmental faculty.

Students from other departments at Cornell may consider a minor in Human Development. A minor may be useful for students who are aiming for careers that involve interacting with children, teens, or older adults. Students are required to take one of three introductory courses in Human Development, plus four more HD classes. Students electing the minor may specialize in a particular age group or area in HD.
