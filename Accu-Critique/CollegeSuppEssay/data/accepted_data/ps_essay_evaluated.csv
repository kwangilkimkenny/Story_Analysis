0,Admitsee,3,1,2,3,,5,,"In my life and family, I have always felt in the middle between two warring halves of my identity: my mother and my father. My parents have been divorced for five years and have been at war ever since. I have always been in the middle between two people I love the most who cannot manage to love each other. While I move between the two houses, shuffling back and forth by court order, I never feel at home in either house, with either parent, or in either half of my identity; I can float back and forth but never touch the ground. My mom is Danish and her entire family still lives in Denmark. My dad is Native American and is a Native American history professor. I carry both of my parents' identities: Danish and Native. An entire ocean has always separated the two halves of my identity, but a divorce drove them further away. If my Danish mom and Native dad cannot be together, how can those two aspects of my identity be together in me?In my life constantly moving between houses, it is hard to feel at home; hard to feel at rest. I feel like I'm in a long car ride, looking at the trees become a blur. It's hard to know what to focus on to keep myself from getting motion sick. As I am whipped around and pulled between my parents, I've had to find a horizon to look at: something in the distance that from far enough away seems still. The only thing other than stubbornness that my parents have in common is their devotion to academics. They have always encouraged my education and been able to agree on that. Myschool has become my safe place, the window where I can see my reflection, despite the blurring trees in the background. Although the environment of my school can feel constricting, it is also freeing. At school I can work hard and dream about a future where there is stillness, my horizon.While my parents gave me my two identity halves, I have had to work to keep them together; ensuring they do not split apart like the parents they come from. To me, growing up meant the disillusionment of my parents as heros, and the struggle of not being able to rely on them anymore. To survive in my circumstance, I had to mature into the person that takes care of things. I have had to practically wrestle the pride out of my parents to get them to communicate on every little aspect of my life. I have realized that the beauty of my circumstance is that I must work so hard to keep my halves together and the perseverance and initiative I have learned are invaluable.If I can make my parents compromise, and make peace between my warring halves, not only can I finally exist peacefully as myself, but I can reconcile any situation. I now unapologetically take ownership over every aspect of my life.I hope to find a community where I can be Native on my own terms; a community where I can also be Danish; a community where I won't feel shame in one identity because of the other; a community that can be a home where I don't have to pack up and leave every Tuesday and Thursday.A white classmate recently questioned my authenticity as a Native, and another in the same week told me with envy that I was a 'check-box' for colleges. These racist comments highlight the battle I've been in for a lifetime. My identity and insecurities won't go away, but in my life of reconciling, I have found confidence and peace in myself. Now, those comments are just part of the blur; trees whizzing past me as I continue towards my horizon. I'm in motion, heading forwards.When I first saw Columbia, my Grandma's friend toured us around the campus. My Grandma's friend told me her greatest advice looking at colleges was to read the student newspapers to better gauge the students at the school, and how the school allows students to express themselves. While I immediately loved the beautiful libraries and city campus, something else stuck out to me. Being Native American, I am looking for a school that will have a strong cultural center that I can be a part of. After looking through the Columbia Spectator, I noticed an article about the native presence at Columbia, or rather lack thereof. The article, written by a member of Columbia's cultural center, pointed out that the school should do a better job of recruiting native students from many different tribes, socio economic backgrounds, and regions. The article also mentioned College Horizons, which I would be attending in 2 months at the time. From that article I knew that not only would Columbia have a native community I could join, but the native community there was strong enough to stand up for itself. I would love to go to a school that not only has a native presence, but continues to push itself to be better and expand that presence. I hope that at Columbia I can aid this effort and that I will be pushed to be a better version of myself as well. I also think the annual Powwow seems fun.",,,
1,Admitsee,3.5,1,2,3,,5,6,"High school has been full of immense growth, both academically and emotionally. In classes like English and World History, I engaged in hours of the Socratic method, discussing fictions, primary sources, philosophy, and poetry. While my skills as a writer blossomed into prose that I was proud to call my own, the discussions proved much more difficult for me. Before high school, being a 'good student' consisted of sitting quietly in my chair, listening to the teacher, and dutifully following instructions. As a ninth grader, I suddenly found myself transported to an environment where verbal participation was graded, and the quiet, studious persona I had cultivated was forced to shift into something bolder. At first, I struggled to find and maintain this boldness. I was confident in my own abilities to read literature with a critical eye and make intertextual connections. I could masterfully compose poems and enjoyed lending a listening ear to the continuous storytelling of those around me. But being bold, verbalizing what was going on in my head, this was a separate challenge. During my junior year, finding myself frustrated at my lackluster participation, I decided, like introverts often do, to take a step back and examine why I felt this fear. I had always had a bit of social anxiety growing up, I thought, but doesn't everyone, at least to a certain extent? In an attempt to organize my cluttered brain, I reflected on the times when I had stepped out in courage, and was immediately struck with how rewarding those moments had been. I auditioned and was cast as the lead in the school musical. I signed up for student government and successfully helped lead my school as a Prefect for two years. I was a founding member of a high school. Boldness, courage, and hope. These traits, upon reflection, were not in short supply. Rather, it was the mistrust in my own abilities that hindered my confidence. The confidence I needed to lead, to be a good student and a faithful friend, and to speak boldly when I had something to say. There were just forty-five of us. Forty five timid yet daring freshman and sophomores who took the courageous first step into building culture and tradition. With our large stack of new books in hand and little real idea of what was yet to come, we stepped onto the small campus to start our new adventure. On August 26, 2015 we opened Pacifica Christian High School. The first year was filled with trial and error, leading to many valuable questions about how a school should run. We instituted a student government, and quickly realized how valuable it was to allow input from each member, instead of an authoritarian head. Because the classrooms were still being finished when school began, my Honors Biology class conducted experiments and discussions outside, without desks. In the winter of our first year, we performed the inaugural play, bringing together a diverse group of both athletes and artists who recited their lines with gusto and flair, despite our small audience. We founded sports teams, including indoor and beach volleyball, soccer, basketball, cross country and track, and performed surprisingly well at our various matches and meets. It was a time of excitement and beginnings. We were a small but mighty group, who saw first year challenges as opportunities to pause and contemplate, in order that we might build a school with firm foundations. That first year was a dream. With only forty five kids and seven teachers on campus, everything and everyone was accessible. When faced with a question or concern, I could knock on the Head of School's door and begin a personal dialogue. During lunch, students and teachers sat together and talked about class literature as well as our favorite TV shows. We were treated like adults, and in return, the atmosphere at school was one of mutual respect and ease of conversation. These past years have been full of immense growth, both academically and emotionally. In classes like English and World History, I engaged in the Socratic method to discuss great works of fiction, philosophy, and poetry. While my skills as a writer blossomed into prose I was immensely proud of, discussions proved much more difficult. Before high school, being a 'good student' consisted of sitting quietly in my chair, listening to the teacher, and following instructions dutifully.

I have struggled with finding and maintaining this boldness. As an introvert, I am confident in my own abilities to read with a critical eye and make intertextual connections. I can write stories and poems and enjoy lending a listening ear to the often dramatic storytelling of those around me. But being bold, verbalizing my inner thoughts, is a separate challenge.

3,Admitsee,3.5,1,2,3,,5,6,"Resilience. A buzzword thrown around by guidance counsellors, self-help gurus, and college applicants alike, many people liken it to a sort of inborn talent found only in the likes of the highly successful. I beg to differ.Growing up in the oil capital of Canada, I was surrounded by an 'economy before environment' mentality, where carbon taxes were unashamedly repealed in favour of fossil fuel development. Road trips through the Rockies meant seeing mountainsides littered with the remains of trees, burnt to ash or cleared for mining. I couldn't help but feel a deep-seated sense of injustice\u2014the planet sustaining our very lives was in a losing battle against corporate interests. As soon as I was old enough\u2014a mere nine years old\u2014I started participating in science fair, finding innovative ways, from eco-friendly road salt alternatives to designing safer pipelines, to preserve the environment. Along with volunteering with environmental groups, I was content that I was doing the most I could. That all changed with the Amazon wildfires. It hit close to home after I'd spent months extensively studying trees to enhance their resilience to wildfires. As I watched the world's most important ecosystem perishing in fire, the powerlessness I felt spurred me into action. Within weeks, I sold my first art print on Etsy, intending to donate the entirety of my profit. The euphoria quickly disappeared, as more weeks passed and only a few orders were trickling in. Everyone around me was telling me to be realistic, let go of such a lofty ambition. My determination began to waver\u2014would this make any more of a difference than a nine-year-old's science project? But I knew, though we may not feel much impact from the choices to neglect the environment, there were billions of unseen people who were paying the price\u2014whether it was losing their homes and livelihoods in Brazil, or even losing their lives to waterborne diseases in Africa. It wasn't about me or my confidence; this was something far bigger, and I couldn't give up when there was still a chance. I had to help.Over the summer, I relentlessly expanded my business, diversifying my social media pages and advertisements to reach more potential customers. I started a website, adding blog entries to raise awareness and real-time updates of the impact my business was making. This prompted a flurry of online support, bringing about collaborations with like-minded clothing companies and influencers\u2014my cause was starting to get through to people. Before long, I was selling four times as many prints, and several of my Etsy listings had climbed to the first page. Though I was sometimes spending six hours a day coordinating it all, it heartened me to know that it'd be making a concrete contribution. As I'm writing this, I've donated over $250 to the Amazon Forest Fund to help combat the wildfires. I've put another portion towards the global water crisis, my efforts providing more than 200 people in rural Kenya, Uganda, and Malawi with safe drinking water. I wanted to help back home too\u2014it was what had stirred my desire to protect the environment all those years ago. With my donated revenue, nearly 40 miles of Canada's coastline are now free of plastic waste. In the end, I found resilience. What started as a formidable challenge ended as one of my greatest gains. It was second only to, after years of aching to make a difference and months of self-doubt, finally changing a bit of the world for the better. Resilience had always felt far beyond my grasp; in my eyes, it was a mysterious force that could push people to achieve the unimaginable. But I see now: resilience is neither a talent nor a skill. It's an inherent trait that emerges when one has found an exploit so compelling, that giving up\u2014should it ever come to mind\u2014isn't an option. Once I'd found a cause that truly resonated with me, it wasn't hard to find the will to succeed, not only in spite of adversity, but because of adversity. So I have faith that my business will go far, to make more impact and change more lives\u2014because I won't stop trying until it does.Inhibit gibberellin biosynthesis? Manipulate soil water potential? 'Could I even make that work?' I asked aloud. I furiously erased, then started pacing again. Some called it creating, others called it innovating, I called it the unscientific method. It was how my science fair projects came to be. At the time, I'd gathered my notes, intending to conceive a solution to the imminent, yet still unsolved issue of wildfires. Lined papers congested with writing were scattered across my desk, with some thrown in the direction of the wastebasket to signify vetoed ideas. The conventional approaches of prescribed burning and fire suppression had long taken their place there, as I had opted to take the road less travelled. This road, so to speak, was to combat fire proactively, rather than continue down the same negligent, reactive path. The idea to focus on wildfire resilience had been born soon thereafter. From there, there were still boundless 'roads' to take, but so long as I had the will, there'd be a way\u2014my cluttered desk would clear eventually to reveal a solution.Science fair quickly became an outlet for my creativity. The 'unscientific' element was what I revelled in\u2014instead of school labs that had to fulfill a curriculum-themed rubric, I could go where my interests took me. My last two projects have both been formulated from scratch, though built on extensive research. In my sophomore year, after thorough research into a zeolite rock called clinoptilolite, I developed a procedure to extract potassium from seawater, harnessing its adsorption-desorption properties to produce an alternative to chemical fertilizer. Last year, I did successfully design and test a method, one that addressed the two most important factors in determining wildfire resilience. I had devised an original method, rooted in the principles of deficit irrigation, that used gradual water stress imposition to stimulate adaptations developing bark thickness and higher moisture content. My creativity has allowed me to encounter these unique and new areas\u2014Yale published a study just last month finding bark thickness to be key to survival in the Amazon wildfire\u2014that still have great potential for innovative ideas and breakthroughs.Growing up in the oil capital of Canada, I was surrounded by an 'economy before environment' mentality, where carbon taxes were unashamedly repealed in favour of fossil fuel development. I knew it wasn't right that the planet sustaining our very lives was in a losing battle against corporate interests. Whenever I went on trips to the Rockies, I would see mountainsides littered with the remains of trees burnt to ash or cleared for mining\u2014I couldn't help but feel a deep-seated sense of injustice. So, I started volunteering with environmental groups and raising local awareness, content that I was doing the most I could. But that all changed with the Amazon wildfires. It hit close to home after I had spent months extensively studying trees to enhance their resilience to wildfires. As I watched one of the world's most important ecosystems perish in fire, the powerlessness I felt spurred me into action. Within weeks, I sold my first art print, intending to donate the entirety of my profit. But after that, sales were slow, and it seemed to be going nowhere. I knew I couldn't give up\u2014the destruction of the environment had reached this point because people had neglected it, given up when there was still a chance to save it. I had to help. Over the summer, I relentlessly expanded my business, diversifying advertisements to reach more potential customers. I gained support for my cause online\u2014even offers to collaborate. Soon, I was selling four times as many prints, and several of my Etsy listings had climbed to the first page. As I'm writing this, I've donated over $250 towards the Amazon Forest Fund to distribute to indigenous communities combating the fires. I've put another portion towards the global water crisis, providing more than 200 people in rural Kenya, Uganda, and Malawi with safe drinking water. Starting my business has taught me that when an exploit is compelling enough, giving up, if it even crosses your mind, is no longer an option. Despite adversity, I never lost faith that my business would succeed\u2014because I knew I'd keep trying until it did.",,,
4,Admitsee,4,1,,,4,,,"When I call my Auntie Balbir 'Machiavellian,' I mean it as a compliment. A slight Punjabi woman, she took care of my siblings and me during our parents' erratic work hours. Her tight bun, sharp eye, and precise, commanding manner quickly inspired in us a respect for household rules and a fear of the time-out corner. Escaping from communal riots in India following the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Auntie B.arrived in America as a refugee. Fortuna placed her in an unfamiliar land with a culture and language distinct from her own, and she battled solitude, grief, and a fear of the unknown. It was her virt\u00f9 that guided her in founding a successful organization to help immigrants find work, which she complemented with her burgeoning nanny agency and massage business. 'Nothing is permanent' she would say in Hindi while smoothing out creases in a batch of freshly washed laundry, 'But your skills stay with you forever.' My siblings and I often listened to her teachings and stories during drives to school and amidst the community service she engaged us in at the nearby Sikh temple. As a playful child who feared chastisement, I followed her tokens of advice but sometimes I secretly wished she would become Maria from The Sound of Music and imagined myself singing 'Do-Re-Mi' on the green, rolling hills of Austria. Growing up I didn't understand the importance of Auntie B.'s unusual combination of strict punishments and inspirational narratives until I studied the political theories and philosophies of Niccol\u00f3 Machiavelli last summer. I centered my focus on Machiavelli's The Prince and his Discourses on Livy, examining his views on the productivity of fear in governing a principality. I analyzed his descriptions of European historical events, including Cesare Borgia's brutal maintenance of Romagna and Oliverotto da Fermo's seizure of the town of Fermo, assessing the ways each ruler used fear to maintain control of the populace. I then created a taxonomy of the various types of fear in Machiavelli's political writings, identifying each according to its utility in moments of political uncertainty and unrest. In addition, I examined the rhetorical techniques Machiavelli himself used when presenting his arguments to his readers. Carrying out this research helped me discern the ways Auntie B. shaped my understanding of the world.Although I joked about Auntie B.'s appreciation of the idea that it is better to be feared than loved, I realized her use of punishments (especially the dreaded time-out corner) not only as a deliberate strategy to maintain order over three mischievous children but also as an informal introduction to politics and power structures. I found in Auntie B.'s stories, too, a reflection of Machiavelli's statement, 'Everything that occurs in the world, in every epoch, has something that corresponds to it in ancient times.' Just as Machiavelli relates historical examples of the Roman Empire to Florence in an effort to bring about the success of the Florentine Republic, I saw how Auntie B. used history to inform our understanding of contemporary times. Her stories about beginning her massage business were meant to teach us about the value of economic self-sufficiency. She intended her tales about helping other immigrants to show us the importance of community strength. Today, I look for correlations between historical and modern political affairs when examining social policies and work to uphold the values of courage, compassion, and foresight that are incorporated in the power of virt\u00f9 that Auntie B. illustrated with her journey and Machiavelli speaks to in his writings. Although Machiavelli's political thought is sometimes seen as overly shrewd and did not become mainstream, for me, he offers an uncommon and subtle way of perceiving the world in which history, fortuna, and virt\u00f9 all play significant roles in shaping one's path, a perspective that we all can apply to our daily lives.Every individual, I learned, is 'Machiavellian' in some form.",,,
5,Admitsee,3.5,1,,3,4,,,"I inhale deeply and blow harder than I thought possible, pushing the tiny ember from its resting place on the candle out into the air. The room erupts around me, and 'Happy Birthday!' cheers echo through the halls. It's time to make a wish. In my mind, that new Limited Edition Deluxe Ben 10 watch will soon be mine. My parents and the aunties and uncles around me attempt to point me in a different direction. 'Wish that you get to go to the temple every day when you're older! Wish that you memorize all your Sanskrit texts before you turn 6! Wish that you can live in India after college!' My ears listen, but my mind tunes them out, as nothing could possibly compare to that toy watch! What I never realized on my third birthday is that those wishes quietly tell the story of how my family hopes my life will play out. In this version of my life, there wasn't much room for change, personal growth, or 'rocking the boat.' A vital aspect of my family's cultural background is their focus on accepting things as they are. Growing up, I was discouraged from questioning others or asking questions that didn't have definitive yes or no answers. If I innocently asked my grandma why she expected me to touch her feet, my dad would grab my hand in a sudden swoop, look me sternly in the eye, and tell me not to disrespect her like that again. At home, if I mentioned that I had tried eggs for breakfast at a friend's house, I'd be looked at like I had just committed a felony for eating what my parents considered meat. If I asked the priest at the temple why he had asked an Indian man and his white wife to leave, I'd be met with a condescending glare and told that I should also leave for asking such questions.In direct contrast, my curiosity was invited and encouraged at school. After an environmental science lesson, I stayed for a few minutes after class to ask my 4th-grade science teacher with wide eyes how it was possible that Niagara Falls doesn't run out of flowing water. Instead of scolding me for asking her a 'dumb question,' she smiled and explained the intricacy of the water cycle. Now, if a teacher mentions that we'll learn about why a certain proof or idea works only in a future class, I'll stay after to ask more or pour through an advanced textbook to try to understand it. While my perspective was widening at school, the receptiveness to raising complex questions at home was diminishing. After earning my driver's license, I registered as an organ donor. My small checkmark on a piece of paper led to an intense clash between my and my parents' moral platform. I wanted to ensure that I positively contributed to society, while my parents believed that organ donation was an unfamiliar and unnecessary cultural taboo. I would often ask for clarity or for reasons that supported their ideologies. Their response would usually entail feeling a deep, visceral sense that traditions must be followed exactly as taught, without objection. Told in one language to keep asking questions and in another to ask only the right ones, I chose exploring questions that don't have answers, rather than accepting answers that don't get questioned. When it comes to the maze of learning, even when I take a wrong turn and encounter roadblocks that are meant to stop me, I've learned to climb over them and keep moving forward. My curiosity strengthens with each hurdle and has expanded into a pure love of learning new things. I've become someone who seeks to understand things at a fundamental level and who finds excitement in taking on big questions that have yet to be solved. I'm no longer afraid to rock the boat.",,,
6,Admitsee,4,,,3,,5,6,"The truth is that fullness of soul can sometimes overflow in utter vapidity of language, for none of us can everexpress the exact measure of his needs or his thoughts or his sorrows; and human speech is like a cracked kettleon which we tap crude rhythms for bears to dance to, while we long to make music that will melt the stars.' -Gustave Flaubert, Madame BovaryExpression is paramount; it is difficult; it is a dealbreaker. In my own search for meaningful articulation, I struggle.And every time I struggle, I question myself and my purpose. The answer is always the same: Maybe I can domore. Maybe being just a little bit better at an aspect of my life will change the purpose of my existence throughthe opportunities it would present to me. Maybe. Or maybe not. Maybe our own crude rhythms drown out thebeginnings of a melody that would, in fact, melt the stars. Perhaps our fullest potential is locked in a vault ofdestiny that will only be unlocked with the passing of time. Whatever the case is, I seldom read a novel withphilosophical savviness that captivates me. Gustave Flaubert's endless pursuit of 'le mot juste' (the right word)when he wrote Madame Bovary was essential to the way I approached life. 'The right word' can easily become'the right thought' and 'the right action'. Still, I knew I was coming up cataclysmically short. Then, collegeapplications entered the picture.The college admissions process has changed me. In terms of introspection, nothing compares to attempting tosqueeze every ounce of your vitality onto an application, aware that the imminent judgement will shape your life.When I began the process of admissions, perfection was essential. 'Le application juste' consumed me and raisednumerous unsettling questions. Will my imperfect high school, a place I love, be a barrier to my admission? Am Igood enough? Will an essay about expressing yourself through an application submitted to that very applicationcome across as distasteful? Luckily, I don't have to answer those questions, but thinking about them was when Ifinally knew: the quintessence of my being couldn't be articulated. In fairness, nobody's can. The process ofcollege admission has transformed me into a person who is more aware of the experiences of other peoplebecause I know how hard it is to aptly describe the value of our isolated histories. We may try, but the crackedkettle of human existence and conveyance is too great a burden. And still, we try. We try because each one of usknows that their individual purpose is noble and meaningful. Once I knew that the soundness of my resolve woulddefine me and that no amount of savoir faire could ever break others out of the prison of misunderstanding, Iunderstood that, in life, the content of my essence is exponentially greater than the content on my resume.Still, good idioms are a dime a dozen. However, meaning is rare and is usually either gone in the blink of an eye ormust be refined by painstaking attention to detail. As I come to this junction in my life and look back on what I havedone, I find myself appeased but not fulfilled. There is no way to adequately express my sorrows or my hopes for the future, but I know that they will melt the stars. That might be just what a meaningful individual experience is:uncertain conviction. The lump in my throat is mollified by my faith in my own resolve. People are engrossed in thepursuit of solving the mystery of expression, but I think the code might be cracked through resolute determinationto try, no matter how many times we fall short. Because our crude rhythms can melt the stars after all, so long aswe long to do so.",,,

10,Admitsee,4.5,1,,,4,5,,"Bloomington Normal is almost laughably clich\u00e9 for a midwestern city. Vast swathes of corn envelop winding roads and the heady smell of BBQ smoke pervades the countryside every summer. Yet, underlying the trite norms of Normal is the prescriptive force of tradition\u2014the expectation to fulfill my role as a female Filipino by playing Debussy in the yearly piano festival and enrolling in multivariable calculus instead of political philosophy.So when I discovered the technical demand of bebop, the triplet groove, and the intricacies of chordal harmony after ten years of grueling classical piano, I was fascinated by the music's novelty. Jazz guitar was not only evocative and creative, but also strangely liberating. I began to explore different pedagogical methods, transcribe solos from the greats, and experiment with various approaches until my own unique sound began to develop. And, although I did not know what would be the 'best' route for me to follow as a musician, the freedom to forge whatever path I felt was right seemed to be exactly what I needed; there were no expectations for me to continue in any particular way\u2014only the way that suited my own desires.While journeying this trail, I found myself at Interlochen Arts Camp the summer before my junior year. Never before had I been immersed in an environment so conducive to musical growth: I was surrounded by people intensely passionate about pursuing all kinds of art with no regard for ideas of what art 'should' be. I knew immediately that this would be a perfect opportunity to cultivate my sound, unbounded by the limits of confining tradition. On the first day of camp, I found that my peer guitarist in big band was another Filipino girl from Illinois. Until that moment, my endeavors in jazz guitar had been a solitary effort; I had no one with whom to collaborate and no one against whom I could compare myself, much less someone from a background mirroring my own. I was eager to play with her, but while I quickly recognized a slew of differences between us\u2014different heights, guitars, and even playing styles\u2014others seemed to have trouble making that distinction during performances. Some even went as far as calling me 'other-Francesca.' Thus, amidst the glittering lakes and musky pine needles of Interlochen, I once again confronted Bloomington's frustrating expectations.After being mistaken for her several times, I could not help but view Francesca as a standard of what the 'female Filipino jazz guitarist' should embody. Her improvisatory language, comping style and even personal qualities loomed above me as something I had to live up to. Nevertheless, as Francesca and I continued to play together, it was not long before we connected through our creative pursuit. In time, I learned to draw inspiration from her instead of feeling pressured to follow whatever precedent I thought she set. I found that I grew because of, rather than in spite of, her presence; I could find solace in our similarities and even a sense of comfort in an unfamiliar environment without being trapped by expectation. Though the pressure to conform was still present\u2014and will likely remain present in my life no matter what genre I'm playing or what pursuits I engage in\u2014I learned to eschew its corrosive influence and enjoy the rewards that it brings. While my encounter with Francesca at first sparked a feeling of pressure to conform in a setting where I never thought I would feel its presence, it also carried the warmth of finding someone with whom I could connect. Like the admittedly trite conditions of my hometown, the resemblances between us provided comfort to me through their familiarity. I ultimately found that I can embrace this warmth while still rejecting the pressure to succumb to expectations, and that, in the careful balance between these elements, I can grow in a way that feels both like discovery and home at once.",,,
11,Admitsee,4.5,1,2,3,,5,,"Tchaikovsky filled the sweaty room of barres and mirrored walls as I plunged into battement fondu. Not to be confused with the sweet sensations of chocolate fondue, this ballet exercise requires killer calf strength and mental stamina. I became consumed by the visuals in the mirror, eyes watering as I questioned if my relev\u00e9 was high enough, knee straight enough, pli\u00e9 deep enough. Those tears didn't actually fall until weeks later, with no Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake to accompany the frustrations this time. I expressed to my ballet teacher that I was quitting ballet, my passion. Shocked, she pleaded me to try temporarily dancing once a week, but I refused. The decision was beyond my control. During my junior year, my doctor informed me I needed to put dancing on hold for the sake of my health, as I had been diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency. The most challenging part of the process wasn't the discomfort of giving myself a daily shot, but having to slow down in what I thrived in giving my all. If I couldn't spend as many hours dancing in the pursuit of perfecting my craft, then I felt I didn't deserve to dance at all. Those weeks of not dancing felt uncomfortable and disorienting. I had to awkwardly respond to my friends' reactions to having quit an activity so integral to my identity. I convinced myself keeping busy would let me forget about dance, so I tried a gym membership, new school clubs, volunteering more, and adding more challenging academic classes. Yet, I still felt empty inside. Nothing could replace the satisfaction of hard work in the studio. Eventually, I figured it was time to see if, even at this slower pace, reintroducing dance into my life would make me feel myself again. Bringing back dance surprisingly made me feel more connected to myself. Prior to my break, I lost touch with the 'performing arts' definition of dance, overly concerning myself with the visual. The stress of how I'd compare to others at that next performance, competition, or audition inhibited me from dancing for myself, having been so focused on perfecting what would be seen by the audience. Returning to dance, although it took until senior year to be full-time again, made me treasure how precious the gifts of movement and artistic expression are. My gratitude for the art form skyrocketed as I'm simply appreciative to have a body healthy enough to perform such anatomically-defying positions. Hearing Odette's Act II Swan Lake variation no longer elicited pressure to have that perfect relev. I moved to a barre spot where I'm freed from the sight of a mirror, instead focused on translating such beautiful melodies into the character of a desperate, innocent swan. Stepping away from that reflection was invigorating. Focusing on the feelings, not appearances, of movement was meditative, making me feel more present and alive.Though I still have days of 'blood, sweat, and tears,' these struggles motivate me to work harder, to cherish the pain of holding that leg up for one more second. The fulfillment produced from working to please myself, without being consumed with perfecting the end result, inspires me to take risks and try out new experiences. Such an experience includes celebrating Bathukamma with my Indian friend. I enjoyed the discomfort of being the only Latina in the Hindu celebration as I allowed myself to become engrossed in a vastly different culture. Another instance was volunteering as a contortionist at my school's haunted house. While I may not have the stereotyped strong arms of a contortionist, I enjoyed exposing myself to a new art form with no pressure to be perfect.Realizing this power of working for myself through overcoming the obstacles of my diagnosis has allowed me to redefine my perception of success as far beyond the external image. Such an understanding will carry me forward in any field.",,,

14,Admitsee,4,,2,3,,5,6,"Learn for the sake of learning!' my English teacher chirped. For the thousandth time this year, a student's complaint about the apparent irrelevance of the day's grammar lesson gave my teacher her cue to once again declare these words, which in turn only evoked more groans and grumbles from my classmates. Personally, by the 900th time that my teacher's voice had carved that phrase into my mind, I had come to agree with its message-or so I thought. That word, 'learn,' still prodded incessantly at my neurons like a restless toddler to its mother. But when I finally gave in to its relentless badgering, I was able to detect the inherent irony in that word when examined in the context of America's public education system.For almost twelve years, public school has saturated my brain with gallons of information that have challenged me to think thoroughly about subjects like science and history and language, but these subjects are always separated into isolated spheres of existence. Throughout my educational career, teachers have turned their backs on valuable opportunities to identify multidisciplinary relationships, such as that between our history lesson on the development of the watermill in 19th century America and our physics lesson on the effect of hydropower on rotational motion. Like a zoo to its caged animals, the American public school system has trained us to compartmentalize not only our daily activities, but also our thought processes. For eight hours a day, five days a week, a bell dices the vast expanse of knowledge that the world holds in front of us into neat, 47 minute lectures, dictating when we study what and for how long we study it.We attend school almost every day, but we don't truly learn anymore. When we were babies, our neurons were authorized to freely unite the logical left and creative right hemispheres of our minds. Interdisciplinarity in our youthful thoughts and fundamental lessons was expected; learning was not just easy, but it was celebrated. Every connection, every articulated thought, every discovery was an accomplishment. But the day we entered kindergarten was the day that cages were constructed and locked around our thoughts, significantly reducing our cognitive capabilities during the hours of 7:55 a.m. and 2:45 p.m.I want to learn again. I don't just want to know why parentheses precede the period. Rather, I want to discuss the possible future of the English language by analyzing its transformation over time, because that kind of intellectual activity forces me to think about the past, present, and future forms of the world I live in. I don't just want to memorize the world's most fatal diseases, because I still won't know how to use the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology as a possible tool to find their cures. Instead, I want to learn how concepts like music theory that do not traditionally exist in the medical field can be applied when detecting abnormalities in the human body, because that kind of knowledge both strengthens the ties between each half of my brain and better prepares me to serve as a member of the healthcare community in the future.America's public education system currently isolates the academic disciplines, depriving students of a diverse, interconnected, relevant learning experience. As a result, the solution needed to save the next generation of fresh minds from the confines of stainless steel mental cages is to correct the curriculum. Correct the curriculum so students understand that education is a heterogeneous entity whose elements must interact freely for them to be most effectively applied post-graduation. Correct the curriculum so the abbreviated 'Distance equals Rate times Time' formula-DRT-refers to a new method of academic exploration: Discuss, Research, Think. Correct the curriculum so we can do more than just learn for the sake of learning, but we can once again learn for the sake of intellectually developing.",,,
15,Admitsee,4,1,,,,5,6,"Altruistic to my core, I routinely create intricate desserts well past midnight for birthdays and holidays, or simply to extend kindness to others. I have earned the title of 'mom' among my friends and teammates which humorously reveals the effect of my culinary gestures. Baking requires precision and is affected by many variables, any one of which can drastically alter its outcome. The recipe assumes a perfect environment; it fails if a single discrepancy occurs. Such is life. As a veritable perfectionist, I outlined my recipe for success freshman year and proceeded accordingly. But, the variables in my environment changed sophomore year as I experienced increased tension within my familial and scholastic spheres. The social aspect of school became an unhealthy situation marred by decisions of others with which I was not comfortable. Furthermore, my mother's relationship with an abusive husband became increasingly violent and negatively affected my academic performance. While school empowered me with confidence and control, it now formed an origin of doubt and disarray. My recipe no longer applied, yet a resolve emerged out of the furnace, strengthened through tribulation. Adapt or fail: this was the dichotomy I faced. My mother raised me with undeniable strength as a single mother, cancer survivor, and sole provider. I, too, became a survivor, and I fought for the girl I used to be: focused, confident, self-assured. I urged my mom to separate from my stepfather, and she agreed, becoming the second divorce I have experienced firsthand. I knew I had to lead my family and myself out of the situation. Growth stems from self-awareness. Confronting my problems allowed me to resolve them. However, I also knew I could not rise to my potential if I remained in my current school environment because of its continued social pressures, and this realization brought additional growth. My circumstances were the catalyst for a new era. Instead of allowing adversity to limit my potential, I leveraged my trials into success. Despite having deep relationships with teachers and peers, high academic standing, and elected leadership roles, I trusted myself and transferred schools in the most pivotal of years. In my new school, my unwavering dedication led me to the top of my class, recipient of numerous awards, but most importantly, genuine happiness. I am still the girl who stays up until 2 a.m. baking for the person whose birthday would otherwise pass unnoticed. Through this tumultuous journey, I developed new strengths, character, and resolve. When I burned my first cake, I was faced with two options: quit or learn. When my life deviated from my recipe for success, I learned that I am not a product of my circumstances, but of my resultant choices. As I emerged from my proverbial oven, I found myself fortified with an inner strength that transcended anything I possessed previously. It empowered me to challenge perceived limitations and achieve my aspirations. Thus, the criterion with which I defined myself evolved, and I obtained resonance with my true character and self-identity. Today, I am capable of actually accomplishing my ambitions because of my past experiences. From standing up for myself and my family, to leaving an unhealthy environment, I removed the obstacles that limited my potential. I was then able to do the same in my community, my true passion; I developed two organizations that resolve separate problems: nonprofit photography and equitable career exploration. I identified areas that required solutions and used my abilities to achieve them. In my own life and the lives of others, I am proud of the change I have affected. Through these endeavors, I have focused on my passions for service and entrepreneurship and actively pursued the future I desire for myself. I am infinitely stronger today than I was two years ago, and I developed valuable traits of resilience and leadership that could have only been gleaned through adversity.",,,

17,Admitsee,4,1,,3,4,5,,"My grandmother once told me that I must be the only person in the entire world who could stand to listen to her talk all day. Every year, I eagerly anticipated her visits to my family in America when she would weave tales of fetching water during neverending mosquito summers in her home country and making a living as a schoolteacher surrounded by sick children and three-legged dogs. Sitting in my air-conditioned and decidedly disease-free room, I felt very lucky. She sacrificed years of her life working so my parents could move to America and give me opportunities she never had. At age seven-and-a-half, I knew my grandmother was the person I admired more than anyone else in the world. Only a year later, that certainty shattered. My grandmother and I were walking home from the grocery store as indigo clouds crept across the setting orange sun. Suddenly, she tugged me by the arm. 'What's wrong?' I asked. Her eyes were narrowed at a man walking toward the bus stop behind us. Her pace quickened; I tripped trying to keep up. Once the man had passed, she told me in a matter-of-fact tone, 'We do not talk to those people.' With a terrible shock, I realized my grandmother's wariness was because the man was black. My tongue forgot itself, and I became sharply aware that the sky had gone dark. I was not ignorant of prejudice. I'd heard kids mock my friend for speaking Spanish with her father and endured strangers' slurs when I trick-or-treated in my neighborhood. I was inured to the world's cruelty, but I'd always believed my family was a shelter from such hatred. From that day forward, however, I began to see stains of my grandmother's prejudice in her everyday habits, gripping my attention and refusing to let go. I yearned to protest the little nods at intolerant politicians on the TV or her tensed expression when we walked into my primarily-black elementary school, but I couldn't. I was the rope in a game of tug-of-war. On one side was justice, pulling with heels dug into the dirt. On the other side was my grandmother, someone I desperately wanted to forgive. How could I tug against her, the woman who had toiled for years to give me the privileged life I had? But what kind of person would I be if I let justice fall into the mud? Searching for answers, I scoured the stories she told me for the root of the problem. There, I found a woman who'd spent nearly her entire life in a country where she was never truly exposed to other races. When she first visited America, the stereotypes she learned were her sole informants on the unfamiliar people she encountered. I could never justify her behavior, but through her story, I began to understand why it existed.Years later, I found myself again in my room telling my grandmother about my closest friends, recounting everything from performing plays together to attending homecoming. When she asked, I described them to her, knowing most of them didn't look like her and me. She said nothing, but something shifted in her eyes, indescribably softening her expression as she listened. In that moment, I knew telling those stories was a step in the right direction.To this day, whenever I see that look on someone else's face, I know I've succeeded in upholding justice in my own way: by communicating. Be it through theater or writing or conversations, I constantly seek out opportunities to tell a story and hear those of other people. In stories I've discovered the power to plant empathy where there was once disregard, acceptance where there was once hatred, and compassion where there was once fear.Guiding everything I do is my quest to understand the world beyond how I alone perceive it and inspire others to do the same.My childhood best friend Jaylynn and I invented hundreds of stories about superheroes, ranging from Super-Sop, the giant sponge who epically absorbs oil spills in the oceans, to Handyman, the advice-giving hand-puppet who epically matches your shoes to your outfit. With imaginary capes trailing behind us, we re-enacted our stories on the playground, saving the world from mad scientists and crazed fashionistas. We were an inseparable duo and vowed to be the force of good no matter what evil we faced.One day, Jaylynn marched into the school cafeteria with a girl trailing behind her. 'This is Kayla,' Jaylynn said brightly. 'She's new: she's from Korea.' In a heavy accent, the girl mumbled, 'Hello.' Before I could say a word back, she turned to Jaylynn and started speaking in Korean. Jaylynn cheerfully responded. I thought they would soon return to English, but instead their rapid-fire exchange of indecipherable syllables seemed to continue for hours. 'What are you talking about?' I finally asked. Engrossed in conversation, they must not have heard me because neither acknowledged my question.Every day for the next few months, Kayla sat with us during lunch, and every day she spoke only to Jaylynn, almost always in Korean. It was as if she were purposely excluding me from their bubble: she never tried to talk to me, and moreover she prevented my best friend from talking to me. Although resentment burst in my chest whenever I saw her, I refrained from lashing out: I knew heroes never stooped to the villains' level.Just like in the stories, however, evil never vanishes without a fight.We were on the playground, and I heard Kayla call Jaylynn two words: best friend. Burning jealousy gripped my heart and refused to let go. I couldn't take it anymore.'You're wrong!' I screamed, anger swelling in my throat. 'She's MY best friend!'The cork had popped on my bottled emotions. I recounted how my every word to Kayla had fallen on deaf ears, how excluded and unwanted she made me feel.Finally, in her thick accent, she softly said, 'I'm sorry.' My heart, previously boiling with rage, dropped ice-cold to my stomach. I recalled hearing that accent in class earlier in the year and seeing classmates tease her for it. I recalled how she slowly stopped talking to anyone besides Jaylynn. I had resented her for that, wishing she'd choose someone else. I realized, however, with a sharp pang that Jaylynn, the only other Korean kid in our school, was the only person with whom Kayla could speak in her native tongue, where she didn't have to worry about navigating harsh English sounds.It struck me that I'd always played the hero on the playground because that's who I thought I was: one of the good guys who saves the world. Looking at Kayla, I didn't feel like a hero anymore. While I had been seething over the bubble she excluded me from, I hadn't seen the wall I had drawn between us nor had I tried to look over to the other side. I had vilified someone who, like me, just wanted to feel accepted.My anger turned into shame and tears. All the apologies in the world didn't feel like enough, and yet, Kayla forgave me. 'We both made mistakes,' she said.In that moment, I found that the world is so much bigger than the tiny lens through which I view it. Whether I'm tackling an unfamiliar problem, debating an issue, or meeting someone new, I know now that nothing is as black-and-white as it may seem on the surface. I know that in a world where many talk, strength is found in being one of the few who listen, in putting myself into someone else's shoes and learning from their experiences. After all, even superheroes cannot save the world if they are blind to the world beyond themselves.'Hello.' That was the first thing Kayla, a new student who had just moved from South Korea, ever said to me. In her thick accent, the two syllables in that simple word tumbled on her tongue like clothes in a washing machine. I became friends with Kayla. We liked the same books and bonded over the trials and tribulations of navigating fifth grade. Whenever she spoke, however, her voice seemed to swallow up her sentences so that you couldn't help but hear her accent before you heard the words she was saying. In hushed giggles, I heard kids mock her when she answered questions in class. I couldn't stand it.When I heard kids mocking Kayla's accent, I implored them to stop and think about how hard it was to grasp a new language. I was greeted with countless rolled eyes and told constantly to 'lighten up.' It made me angry. I was not angry at my peers, however. I was angry at the world. I was angry that I lived in a society that taught us from a young age that some voices are valuable and others are not. I couldn't justify their teasing, but I understood why they did it. We are all products of our environment, and ours is one that hears ignorance in people whose tongues cannot pronounce the word 'ignorance'.In a world where many talk, my greatest strength is being one of the few who listen. It's this philosophy that drives me to constantly question what I think I know and seek out connections with the people around me, striving both to tell my stories and to learn from theirs, whether that be through school, art, speeches, or meeting new friends. I've learned that stories are not any more or less valuable based on whose voice they are told in. Only when we try to understand the human experience in its entirety, not just our own pieces of it, can we see that the world is so much bigger than the tiny lens through which we view it.",,,

Yet, to me, very few things in life compare with the bliss of sitting at my keyboard filling in a venue's ambiance, playing soft melodies accompanied by clinking glasses and casual conversation.This bliss is the reason I lug around my keyboard, stand, and extension cord, complete with a chaotic array of sheet music, to and from events ranging from midday wedding receptions to gallery openings. Along with this collection of equipment, I also bring with me a quality that I value most: the ability to connect with my audience.When I arrived for my first Sunday night gig at the Old Sculpin Gallery, I positioned myself in the corner of the room and pulled out my sheet music as people filtered in. I stretched out my fingers and readjusted the creaky wooden chair beneath me. Then, I exhaled and lowered my trembling fingers to the keys of the starting notes, wincing at the occasional mistake. Soon, the music started to blend in with the room around me, and I eventually gained my confidence and rhythm. A couple of minutes later, someone approached me while I played a Debussy arabesque and said, 'I remember that piece! My piano teacher would always play it for me as a child.' While playing 'It Might As Well Be Spring,' a petit, bespectacled woman broke into a grin and started to hum the tune as she surveyed the pastoral landscapes hanging on the wall next to me.On the surface, music seems to be a relatively simple concept: notes shape a melody, often accompanied by more notes that harmonize with it, maybe with some percussion if the composer wanted to add more structure. When I was younger, my infatuation with music was limited to the rudimentary level of standing on my tiptoes to enthusiastically plunk random notes on the piano in my living room. With age, music has become increasingly fascinating to me because of its ability to affect how we feel while listening to it. Music brings us together as we bond over its raw, emotional power. During the resolution of a fast-paced Bach prelude, its final chord makes me emit a sigh of relief. When I play the flowing chromatic scales in a Chopin nocturne, its melancholy phrasing can transport me to a quiet nighttime stroll along the Seine. As I deliver the electrifying chords of a Rachmaninoff prelude, I feel as though I'm releasing lightning bolts down from a stormy sky.While I may lack the technical skills of a Juilliard-trained concert pianist, my main goal is to elicit an emotional reaction from the audience so that they too can feel the same connection to music that I do. My job is to make at least one chord or phrase bring the audience closer to me and each other.

The ability to spread their legacy and use it to bond with my audiences fulfills me both as an artist and as a human being.

19,Admitsee,4,,2,,,5,,"In a stuffy elementary school cafeteria in rural Vermont, horsehair scraped against steel and tungsten. Kids sat on floor mats or swayed to the heavy, hypnotic beat. I could not hear myself playing the cello over the uproar of the drums;nevertheless, a smile crept across my face. As I shredded away, I lost myself in the tones and harmonies. I felt on the edge, walking a tightrope of creation.My band, SoundCheck, was performing songs about social justice issues like misogyny and immigration, attempting to teach mostly elementary and middle school students about the importance of respecting and loving others. We also led songwriting and activism workshops at schools, rallies, and conferences. My ten band members were students from across Vermont who came fromdiverse social and musical backgrounds, influencing our genre-defying originals. I auditioned for the band in my sophomore year, hoping to expand beyond my background as a classical musician.If I threw myself fully into the music\u2014brow furrowed, head bobbing, feet stomping\u2014the audience responded. If I stayed on safe ground, they did too, creating a chasm of understanding between us. Staying in touch with my emotions helped me better observe how they ebbed and flowed throughoutour performance. I had come to depend on our band rehearsals and performances to help me fine-tune my emotional awareness as I learned to not only communicate emotion to our audiences but also attend to the emotions of others in my daily life.But as we struck the final note of our song and the kids erupted in cheers and applause, a worrying thought materialized, one that I carried around whenever we performed: what if our audience didn't get it? Most of our lyrics were easy enough to understand, and I even exaggerated the way I swayed to the music and smiled or frowned as the lyrics and melody required. Despite my band's efforts to manipulate music to craft our message, I worried that students could still view our performance as a superficial experience. I wondered if music could ever be a meaningful way to communicate concrete ideas about the importance of respect and love.As we transitioned to the workshop, where we conducted a songwriting exercise by asking different groups to write song verses from the perspective of the oppressor, oppressed, and bystander, I asked a fourth-grader to share his thoughts on the exercise. He responded, 'I think this is helpful because I can understand others and what they're going through.''Yes! But why is that important?' I pressed.He paused for a second, and in that moment I could sense his empathy and discovery of purpose. 'We need compassion to help solve our problems together. That's what makes me want to help out a classmate who gets pushed on the playground, even if he's not my friend.'His response revealed why I felt these songs\u2014and our social justice work\u2014on such an emotional level. In his simple response about the importance of compassion, I felt that chasm of understanding closing, instead of widening, between my band and our audience. Feeling is intimately tied to social justice, and the student showed that discrimination affects people not just economically and socially, but emotionally. I hoped our songs could serve as a reminder of this greater emotional understanding, which might lead to a lasting engagement with social justice beyond SoundCheck.A few weeks later, we took the stage of a local middle school. I was ready to walk the creative tightrope once again. In tune with my bandmates, I played with tenderness and sensitivity during an improvised solo and worked hard during the workshop to make personal connections with students. Through playing music, teaching Fall 2020 9 FYEA songwriting, and engaging with others on social justice issues, I have become more in tune with my own emotions and those of others, practicingand inspiring empathy and action along the way.",,,
20,Admitsee,5,1,,,,5,6,"I had spent hours strolling on the narrow bridge, watching the pearl-white water lilies gracefully floating in Monet's pond. Swimming in the uncharted depths of the ocean, I would slip through coral caverns, passing rocky walls festooned with delicate anemones. Each puzzle I finished felt like a magic carpet, hauling me away from the normalcy of my bedroom.Border pieces had to be joined. Pieces had to be grouped. I soaked in the colors, patterns, textures, trying to establish connections. Apart from occasional moments of frustration when my stubbornness kicked in trying to force pieces into places they could never fit, the process was peaceful. Growing older, I challenged myself with ever more sophisticated puzzles. Pieces looked impossibly similar. At the same time, each was maddeningly unique. I had to refine my tactics to turn the daunting chaos into harmonious order. Order appeared in separate areas, evolved independently around seed pieces, growing, region by region.Gradually, I came to view my life through jigsaw-shaped spectacles: every aspect is an oddly-shaped piece which fits into the puzzle that is my life. Some pieces seem to have sprung out of nowhere: my talents, my inherent passions. They grow into regions, each at its own pace. Each region calls for a tailored strategy. However, I no longer begin with border pieces. I have cast them away to reach the unexplored.It was with this boldness that I thrust myself into the endless world of mathematics. I sought adventure in primes and irrationals, in the harmony of forms, the geometric elegance. Since the early years of elementary school, I have tried my hand at several competitions. As a solo puzzler or collaborative solver on the national mathematics team, I felt the thrill as my mind overcame barriers to navigate the winding paths of mathematics. It is the same chord of satisfaction that resonates inside me as I pop an elusive puzzle piece in place.Pieces packed with the slideshows of my dad's distant backpacking travels, carefree conversations with my friends on summer nights, invigorating moments panting with my mom through the Athens mini-marathon, all are tightly woven through time to create my own magic carpet. Edges have long faded. Pieces have fused together. It is from this mesh of ideas, memories, interests, quirks that immense power flows.There are pieces of unmatched strength. Those do not only belong to my personal puzzle. Instead, I share them with others: my family, my friends, people in my country, people all over the world. Each piece we place represents a small triumph, a hint at the ultimate satisfaction of completing our joint puzzle. We work together, exchanging advice, circulating ideas. These exchanges between people who see the world differently breed challenge, and challenge breeds change.Meeting with Syrian refugees in Greece through the online platform I created opened up a new world. I shared with them stories from my school days. They shared their hope of one day going to college. I recounted my grandfather's harrowing escape into refugeehood in 1922 when his hometown of Smyrna was ruthlessly purged. They recounted their own chronicles of heartbreak, following a similar route away from their bombed homes, through fear and sagging tents, to Athens. Together, we paint the puzzle pieces in bold colors. We shape their elaborate edges. As they all intertwine, shapes start to emerge and the picture comes alive.There are no border pieces to my life's puzzle. There is no picture on the outside of the box revealing what the puzzle will eventually look like or how many pieces it will have. As I intricately carve the pieces' undefined edges, each finds its seamlessly-interlocking match. Regions are growing around seeds of intuition and curiosity, waiting to be connected over shared ideas, dreams, experiences. My puzzle is a magic carpet that I steer into uncharted territories. Led by my aspirations, I determine the journey along the way.",,Setting,
21,Admitsee,4,,,,,5,,"Last spring, I had to read easily the most personal thing I'd ever written out loud to 54 people. My poem was about my mother's upbringing in poverty in China, worked her way to the best university in Beijing, full of hope for her future, only to see from the front lines the hope of her country's future and her classmates' lives shattered at Tiananmen. Public speaking had always been something I'd struggled with. How could I possibly share such an intimate part of my family's history to dozens of people, some of whom I barely knew? When the day arrived, I told myself that I would just go up there, shut my brain off for a few minutes, emotionally detach myself from the thing that I had poured so much of my heart into, and sit back down. I told myself that was the only way I would make it. That is not what happened.The first half of my reading was fine. In fact, the nerves I had been fighting almost seemed to dissipate a little. Then, I suddenly realized there were tears streaming down my face, and it was over for me. I started crying uncontrollably, tried desperately to regain my composure and finish, but I couldn't do it. It seemed, in the moment, as if my worst nightmare had come true.I realized later that the reason I was crying had nothing to do with my anxiety about presenting. I'd cried because of the poem itself and what it meant to me. In reacting the way I did, I hadn't failed to speak publicly at all. I had succeeded in all the ways that were important: conveying the destruction of Tiananmen, the emotional impact that it had on me and my family and thousands of others better than words ever could. There was pride to be felt in my vulnerability Even though public speaking may not be the easiest thing for me to do, this incident demonstrated to me that I could do it when it mattered, when I had something important to tell people.On our last night at YYGS, the six of us sat overlooking the dining hall and played one last game of cards with the deck I'd had them all sign. Logan was terrible and Hazuki won with her quiet, unassuming cleverness, as usual. Then we sat quietly until midnight, soaking in each other's company, turning our memories of the two deliriously fantastic over in our heads so they would stay there and new forever. Early the next morning, we had one last group hug, with no words spoken, and that was it. I dragged my suitcase, alone, out the gates, down five blocks to the Greyhound station, Missouri-bound. They left, too, for LA, Irvine, Seattle, Auckland, and Osaka.We'll never play cards together again. Making friends isn't my strongest suit, and I have never formed such strong bonds with anyone that fast, only to be torn apart by distance so suddenly.That last night, we recorded goodbye videos for each other. I still can't bring myself to watch mine. Not after marching band just ended, when I have mere months left with Anushka, my best friend since kindergarten. But I still have that deck of cards, signed with inside jokes: God has cursed Zack's eyes, Kavya doesn't understand bookstores, Diya doesn't know what a cube is. Izzi's a Scientologist. I don't like goodbyes, but life is full of them, and these are the memories that make them worth it.I don't know for sure where I'm going to end up in life. Maybe I'll change the world someday, and maybe I will change one person's life, but that would be enough for me. The weight of a person's impact can be measured a lot of ways--in medals earned, inventions created, or lives saved, but also in how much it hurts to say goodbye. Knowing that, in two short weeks I was able to have some kind of impact on five people I'd never before and might never see again, and knowing that they had the same impact on me, gives me hope for all of our futures.",,,
22,Admitsee,3.5,1,,,,5,6,"A diver is standing on a moving ferris wheel and wants to land in a cart of water that is moving back and forth below. At what point should she jump? This is what I contemplated at age eight, late at night, curled up in my bed reading math textbooks written by my grandma, who had developed a high school math curriculum designed to teach math through its real-life applications. At the time, I didn't understand the math, but I loved the idea that math could be used to solve real world problems. In second grade, I also discovered how important math was to the sport I loved, baseball. My dad taught me about batting averages and how teams use statistics to make important decisions about strategy. My two primary areas of academic interest are math and public policy. I discovered my interest in math through my dad and my grandma. My interest in policy came later, through classes that exposed me to social sciences and comparative governmental systems. I am intrigued by the factors that can lead to the success or failure of one policy approach over another, and the impact those successes or failures can have on different communities. My interest in policy deepened through my internship with the City Council and my work on the Youth Commission. I walk by homeless encampments on my way to school, a stark reminder of my city's growing homelessness crisis. Housing is the focus of the Youth Commission, which is advocating for another youth shelter. The debates about housing are impassioned and emotional, but there are no simple solutions. Most exciting to me is the use of economic theory, statistics, and data to solve complicated societal problems. Our first step in advancing the new youth shelter, for example, is to collect comprehensive data on homeless youth to show the need for a shelter and its viability. I am inspired to use my love for math and statistics not just to figure out the right time to dive off a ferris wheel but to help solve pressing problems in my community. On my first day of kindergarten, I didn't understand a word my teacher said. Six months earlier, I had won the lottery when my name was randomly picked for enrollment in my school district's Spanish-immersion program. My parents seemed thrilled, but on the first day, I didn't feel very lucky. The program consists of an equal number of native English and native Spanish speaking students. Elementary school was taught mostly in Spanish. The program continued in middle school, where I took history and language in Spanish. In high school, I took Spanish for native speakers and two AP Spanish courses.After that intimidating first day of kindergarten, I soon understood everything my teacher said. By the time I finished elementary school, I could speak, read, and write fluently in Spanish. In AP Spanish Literature, I read poetry, 14th century novels, and historical documents such as Hern\u00e0n Cort\u00e9s' 16th century letter to the King of Spain - all in its original language. My second language provides me entry into another world of art, literature, and history. I can directly speak and communicate with millions more people in the world in their native language, and I have already put my language skills to use. For example, many of the students in the fifth grade mock trial class I help teach come from Spanish-speaking homes. I have translated all the course materials into Spanish for them, so their parents can help them with their homework just as easily as the English-speaking parents can. Last year, my family visited the Mesoamerican ruins of Teotihuac\u00e0n. No English-speaking tour guides were available, so I translated the three-hour tour for my family and other tourists. My favorite part of the experience was chatting with the tour guide, who was studying English, about the challenges and rewards of learning a second language. I now feel lucky. The Spanish-immersion program was a gift that has enhanced my education and my life.",,,
23,Admitsee,3.5,,,3,,5,,"When I was in preschool, bedtime stories had the opposite effect from what my mother hoped: they left me energized and full of questions about what came after. Did the pigeon eventually drive the bus? Was Max able to visit the wild things again? Sometimes, my mom concocted halfhearted answers, and other times, probably wondering why the dependable advice of reading to your child before bedtime wasn't working, she would tell me to write my own ending. And so I did. Armed with construction paper, glitter glue, and Crayola markers, I created fantastical sequels to the stories that most intrigued me.Writing my own endings evolved into sneaking chapter books under my desk in elementary school. One of the under-the-table books I read was Marie in the Shadow of the Lion , a novella about twelve and thirteen year olds ensnared in civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The atrocities the child soldiers had to endure and the disconcerting ending of the book diverged sharply from the tidy resolutions of the books I normally read. It also prompted my first foray into advocacy. I talked about this book to anyone who would listen? my friends, my parents, and my teacher, who ended up assigning excerpts to the class and arranging a Skype call with the book?s author. Energized, I researched this issue, learning the US was one of only two countries worldwide that had not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, an international agreement establishing liberties for children. I organized classmates to write a letter to the President and created an online petition, and while we never received a response from the White House and our petition remains in the dusty archives of Change.org, my desire to devise my own endings didn?t end there.By the time I was in high school, sneaking under-the-table books grew into spending lazy weekend mornings engrossed in the New Yorker . In February of this past year, a photo in the magazine caught my eye: teenagers making phone calls on the floor surrounded by bottles of Gatorade, laptops, and notepads. They were students at Stoneman Douglas High School, and they were orchestrating a national movement from someone?s living room. In their focused eyes, I saw the possibility that this particular story didn?t have to end with cynicism and despair regarding our future; that it might continue in a direction yet unknown. Soon after, I found myself in a church basement in southwest Detroit, listening to high school students share their experiences with gun violence as well as racial profiling. These weekly meetings led to a student-run March for Our Lives Detroit, which I helped organize. The materials I used this time weren?t too different from those of my previous literary efforts. But instead of Crayola markers and construction paper, my tools were Sharpie markers, posterboards, and legal pads on which I scribbled interview notes and speaker schedules. And this time, I felt like I?d done more than make up an ending to a story I?d just read. As I walked and chanted with over nine thousand participants, I felt as though I was part of a larger, unbridled movement, a new story that was just beginning.My follow-up questions have grown in intricacy since my preschool days. Why are communities of color affected by environmental degradation to a greater extent? How does governmental instability impact food security? My attempts to answer these questions have propelled me to embark on unfamiliar journeys and become involved in movements with impacts larger than I could have ever imagined. In inviting me to write my own endings, my mother gave me an enormous gift: the confidence to know that I could shape outcomes and the pragmatism to create tangible solutions. I hope my future sequels will be written not in Crayola marker and glitter glue, but in print, as policy-based solutions to global challenges.",,,
24,Admitsee,4,1,,,,5,6,"Rebuilding your entire life's work in one afternoon is a pretty daunting task. That's what I attempted a few Sundaysago, my life's work being the glorious, 151-track opera playlist I spent years cultivating, accidentally deleted with afew careless taps on a phone. Eventually, through sheer force of will and hours of tedium, I recreated a playlist of118 songs. Maybe I'll remember some of those missing 33 eventually, but the rest is lost to me forever.That's okay, though. I'm losing the music I love all the time. The first time I saw Bizet's Carmen, its exhilarating,cathartic beauty crept into every part of my life. Seven-year-old me played Carmen on CD ceaselessly until I'dmemorized every note. Even after ten years of delving recklessly into the opera world, nothing else is as ingrainedin my mind, heart, and soul. Still though, Carmen's only one opera, and the more I memorize it, the more I lose thewonder I felt when I was young and it was new. The days when the intertwining melodies of the Act I duet and thetragedy of Carmen's murder against the thrilling splendor of the bullfight were all I ever thought about. I will neveragain experience Carmen's thrill the same way I once did.There was a time when opera was an electrifying art form just dawning on the world. I've always wondered what itwas like when operas were the blockbusters that people flocked to theaters to see. I'd like to think I would'verecognized Bizet's genius even then. But he was doomed to an early death, Carmen being the last mark he evermade on the music world. Everything he ever wrote and ever will write exists already. Eventually I'll get through allof his music, and all of Verdi's and Puccini's and Mozart's, and someday there won't be any left to discover.Sometimes I feel like the music I love so much is slowly letting out its dying breath, like time has already run outand I'm delusionally grasping onto something that's no longer there.Maybe my playlist will never be as perfect as it once was. And maybe nothing as deliriously perfect to me asCarmen will ever be written again, and I'll spend my lifetime chasing it in vain. But I've learned to live with that.Carmen's novelty is lost to me forever, but the way my heart soars along with the music even now is no differentfrom ten years ago, or from Carmen's first audience in 1875. That audience, the singers, and Bizet are long gone,but Carmen's reckless spirit lives on, resurrected in each performance. It's comforting to know I'm connected to allthose people by at least one beautiful thing.Even if opera is slowly fading, losing its hold on the world, every performance is still as alive as the singersperforming, musicians playing, composers writing. As alive as the scandal, rebellion, and shattered boundariesthat fill operas like Carmen to the brim. As alive as me, breath rising and falling with the crescendoes of the music,crying with the characters' heartbreaks, eyes closed, heart singing with the melody. In the end, that makes it allworth it. I've lost a playlist I spent years perfecting. I'm getting farther away from my favorite music with eachpassing year. But the time I've devoted to opera won't go to waste: the hours spent in opera houses, and thesimpler ones that fill my life\u2014driving, doing homework, falling asleep with arias and overtures playing in my ears,pestering my friends to come watch Turandot at the movie theater or to listen to this one chorus from MadameButterfly. Opera lets me experience entire worlds of music, characters, and emotion created hundreds of yearsago but brought to new life every day. In ten short years, I have lived thousands of full, beautiful, unique lives. Marching band is all about conformity. For eight minutes, 120 of us have to look and sound identical, not a step or note out of place. But if conforming to the standards of marching and music is hard enough, conforming socially is another story. Anytime I saw one of my quiet saxophone freshmen feeling overwhelmed by the sheer vivaciousness of the biggest, loudest section in the band, I thought back to three years ago, when I thought I would never become a true part of the section without changing my entire personality. It was the section leaders who helped me transform the section in my eyes from a group of loud upperclassmen who always talked over me into a family that loved and accepted me despite differing personalities. As a section leader, my most important job, more than teaching people marching and playing, was teaching people to feel welcome. Each year, I watched out for the new members, tried to include them in my conversations and lunch groups, because I knew that even simple kindnesses matter when you feel invisible. At the section bonfire I hosted, the new members got 'initiated' by completing silly tasks like smashing a raw egg on their forehead and we all gathered around to play the flashlight game, a tradition that's been passed through the section for years, and by the end of the night I would see the joy on their faces in becoming a real part of something bigger than themselves. I watched bonds start to form between the most unlikely of people, as the older, louder members start to realize what I'd known all along: that those quiet freshmen are actually funny, dynamic, interesting, incredible people worth knowing. Last month, at my last evening rehearsal, the staff left the field and we had one performance just for ourselves, eight final minutes for seniors to relish the four years we spent doing what we love with the people we can't live without. I've hung up my uniform for the last time, but being a section leader was the greatest honor of my life.Rebuilding your entire life's work in one afternoon is a daunting task.

25,Admitsee,3.5,,,,,5,6,"What used to be two comforting orbs was now a pair of lethal daggers, piercing my heart with its cold, unfamiliar glare. She was completely unrecognizable. The grandma I once knew had a loving gaze, one that beamed of light the day I learned how to ride a bike and one that surveilled protectively behind the screen door as I begged to take the training wheels off. But standing in room 216 of the Lexington Medical Center Alzheimer's ward, I felt like an unwelcome stranger.She no longer met me with her tight, overwhelming embrace\u2014the kind of hug that would leave me gasping for air as she squeezed out every ounce of worry and replaced it with warmth. Instead, my arms opened only to be met with a rageful, 'Get away from me! Who are you?' The force of those words reverberated throughout my body, as though they were physical blows. I was struck by the painful reminder that Alzheimer's Disease held my grandmother captive and had taken away the one person I loved most.Where there were supposed to be firing bundles of neurons, was a grey mush of tangled fibers and clumped proteins. What was meant to be home to heartfelt memories, was now a blank void bereft of all the grand adventures we shared. Instinctively, I found solace in seeking understanding. The sluggish yet faithful Dell desktop in my school's computer lab quickly became my refuge, the world-wide-web my home. I dove headfirst into every search engine I could think of, thirsting for knowledge and craving for answers to my extensive list of 'whys', 'whats', and 'hows'. Why couldn't my grandma remember our Sunday morning tradition of binging Judge Judy before heading to church? According to WebMD, it was because her neural pathways were blocked by Amyloid plaques, aggregates of proteins preventing signals from reaching areas of the brain responsible for cognition. What could I do to make her less angry when I approach her? Various caregiver forums taught me that the best way to relieve her frustration was through distraction. So every subsequent visit, I walked into room 216, boombox in hand, and we bonded through the vibrations of 'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill', just like the old days. How could I prevent Alzheimer's Disease from shattering the dynamics of other families? Despite my vigorous searches, I could not find the answer to this question on Google, or Yahoo Answers, or Bing. In fact, the only result my search rendered was: 'It is impossible to predict or prevent the progression of the disease'\u2014but I do not believe in 'impossibility'. The countless hours I spent delving into the realms of the Internet, trying to understand my grandma's condition, provided me with the tools I needed to properly care for her. I gave her space when she needed it, assured her that she was safe when she felt anxious, and used music to soothe her when she was upset. Some moments during my care, I'd catch a glimpse of those two comforting orbs I once knew, a sense of tenderness and familiarity I never expected to see again. It is because of those instances that I refuse to believe in 'impossible'.My grandma's disease allowed my curiosity to flourish endlessly, my only antidote: finding answers. As part of the AP Capstone research program, I use my research to answer the one question Google, Yahoo Answers, and Bing failed to answer: How could I prevent Alzheimer's Disease from shattering the dynamics of other families? I finally found my answer. Physicians base their diagnoses off anatomical 'markers' such as hippocampal volume or MRI scans, but this method fails to predict the future progression of the disease. Through my research, I utilize statistics and computer modeling to predict early signs of Alzheimer's and take into account future clinical decline. By doing so, I hope my early-detection model will not only give patients access to treatments before the disease worsens, but also give their loved ones time to prepare for the transformative journey ahead. I still have the same, insatiable desire that penetrated the search histories of my school's computer lab. I plan on channeling my devotion to research into a degree in biology, so that I may better understand the complexities of life. But most importantly, I want to be an inspiration to all the young boys and girls who feel like strangers to the ones they love most. I want them to understand that with curiosity, they, too, may do the impossible.",,,
26,Admitsee,2.5,1,,,,5,,"When I was seven years old, I discovered my precious Denny unmoving at the surface of the fish bowl. It wasn't difficult to see that he had passed away to fish heaven. I held an elaborate funeral for him, complete with a eulogy and a symphony playing in the background as I made the final flush. The mournful tribute I had written for my goldfish titled 'Dead Denny' was probably the first poem I ever wrote in my life. That day, I lost one of my first friends but soon realized that I had made another. This one, albeit, took a rather peculiar form: writing. If writing took a tangible body, my younger self would probably describe it as having purple hair, infinite superpowers, and a mischievous smile. I had always been a shy introvert so writing was one of my few best friends- someone who grasped my hand and pulled me into my own limitless imagination in a time when my first inclination to anything, deemed too daunting, was to say no. I never saw writing as just writing. It was almost a person to me- one that took part in my wildest adventures and gave me comfort. When I was fourteen years old, I went to summer camp to take a writing course. There, I met a boy who had broad shoulders and sunkissed hair. We only knew each other for the short few weeks of camp but we quickly became friends. That summer was filled with his corny jokes and Baltimore sunsets. It was after the camp ended when I received the news that he had died in a freak accident. What do you do when you're fourteen and the reality of death hits you like an earthquake: fast, unexpected, and terrifying? I wrote a deeply personal memoir. Then, at the urging of my English teacher, I submitted it to a national writing competition where it received a silver medal. While in the past I had relied on writing to flee from my fears, it slowly coaxed me to confront them. I submitted more pieces to competitions to be judged by strangers, something that was unthinkable in the past. I tried out for the Yearbook Club and discovered that I loved sharing a common passion and treasured the thrill of creating something that lasts forever. The very thing that had pulled me further into my own self as a child was now what thrust me into the great unknown that I had been so afraid of.When I was seventeen years old, my grandmother passed away from a sudden heart attack. I thought I understood death from what had happened three years ago but standing in the grossly fluorescent hospital room, holding her cold hands in mine, I realized with a shattering jolt that I truly didn't. How could someone who had been dancing in the kitchen just a few days ago suddenly be gone? I tried to write an eulogy for her funeral but I couldn't find the words to describe her. Words that had always flowed so effortlessly from my fingertips now seemed unfamiliar in my hands. Since I was young, writing had been there for me. That day I discovered that, almost like having a mind of its own, writing could also leave me. It would have been easier to blame the separate entity I had made writing to be, to ask why and how it could fail me when it should have been there for me. But I've learned that writing isn't a purple-haired superhero with a coy smile. It is not even a person. I am the writer and the superpower lies with me: to create a story, to say goodbye to someone too soon. And maybe as all superheros do - to save the world in my own, small way.When I was seven, I wrote my first book. As I scribbled passionately about kids riding a magical elevator to find their lost dogs, I realized that my first great love wasn't a booger-picking boy who shared his crayons with me. It was writing.Like all great love affairs, this one started off as a teensy crush. Writing short poems was like a few covert glances between a boy and a girl. It slowly dawned on me that words weren't just syllables strung together. They were land mines filled with unexplored ideas waiting to be told. To think that the power rested in my hands\u2014the infinite possibilities excited me. Still, excitement subsided and writing became something I did to pass the time\u2014a casual hookup if you will. However, during a period when I doubted my self-worth due to constant comparison with my exuberant twin sister, writing gave me an opportunity to become my own person. Writing became the special someone that made my insecurities vanish.All long-term relationships encounter a rough patch\u2014'It's not you, it's me. I'm not ready for something serious.' I told my first love I needed to experience new things\u2014badminton, the school orchestra, even forming my own service clubs. But nothing gave me the same thrill as writing did\u2014the childish giddiness of encountering her first crush.In high school, I wrote short stories, winning the gold and silver in the Scholastic Arts and Writing Awards competition. My passion for creativity pushed me to join the Yearbook Club where I formed many friendships. I was even elected as the Editor-in-Chief in my junior year. I also co-founded an online magazine to write about our high school experiences.Now, if you ask me about my first love, I'd say it's doing just fine. We argue when ideas run dry and the frustration of writer's block seeps in but love is all about patience and persistence. I know my greatest talent is something I've worked for just like all relationships.So who's to say that your first love never lasts?'Why are you crying?' My mom asked, bewilderment plastered on her face.I pointed at my fishbowl; precious Dorothy was floating at the surface belly up. She had passed away to fish heaven. I held an elaborate funeral to the amusement of my mother- complete with a eulogy and a melancholy symphony as I made the final flush.I've always loved animals, no matter how small or insignificant they seemed. I could watch ants move a single crumb across a playground for hours. One summer, I realized that Seoul had over 200,000 feral cats living within its borders. I had seen skeletal cats roaming the streets but never really thought about them dying from starvation, cold, disease, or abuse. After a little bit of research, I found that these stray cats rarely live beyond five years.Determined to do something, I found a local cat shelter called Nabiya that took in stray cats. I volunteered to help with the laundry, clean litterboxes, feed, vacuum, mop, and more. Once school started, I realized that a lot of clubs focused on global issues such as North Korean defectors or adopting a child from Africa - but none helped the insignificant and often forgotten such as stray cats that were dying in our own city. I founded the Nabiya Club at my school, partnering with the very organization that I was volunteering at, where I organized fundraisers and hosted monthly shelter visits for club members to actively help the cats. We raised over $2,000 to foot the medical bills of two critically injured cats that would have died otherwise. When I explain to fellow students about Nabiya, they usually chuckle at my 'cat-club' as it has been dubbed. But I believe my club is more than just helping stray cats. It's a step towards helping the often forgotten. I believe the community needs someone who recognizes this importance; someone willing to care for something that may seem trivial in comparison to all the other issues in the world. Perhaps even someone who is willing to hold a funeral for a small goldfish.It's hard to pinpoint what truly makes me different from other amazing applicants. Is it my grades and test scores? No. My eclectic extracurriculars? Probably not. But one thing that truly sets me apart is my family and how each has shaped me.My mom is small in stature but big in everything else including her voice and opinions. Her English is broken so I grew up listening to her rapid Korean. Because kids attending international schools are typically isolated from the mainstream society, my mom made sure that I didn't lose my Korean identity by teaching me difficult Korean phrases and making me watch Kdramas. Besides my almond eyes and oval face, I also inherited my mom's tenacity, pride, and her love for learning.My dad represents the American side of me - he understands my dry humor and loves discussing current events. He grew up in Korea but immigrated to California in his teens not knowing any English. He always tells me how much harder he had to work in school just to achieve the same results as his peers. While I am inspired by his struggles, I know that his story is not mine. I was fortunate to receive an amazing education and constant support - my dad taught me never to take my privileges for granted.My twin sister...well, she's in a class of her own. My fiercest competitor and best friend, she is the most fearless person I know. She has pushed me, a shy introvert, to never let the fear of failure dictate my actions. It's also through being compared to her that I have learned the importance of individuality and being my own person.I know that my academic achievements or the clubs that I have founded does not differentiate me from other competitive applicants. It is the values that I possess, the family that raised me, and the fusion of two contrasting cultures that I grew up with that makes me unique. I am not just my parent's daughter, a twin sister, Korean, or even American. I am all of the above. To the many pedestrians passing by us on the street, we must have been quite an amusing sight: a large group of high schoolers holding a giant inflatable globe, huge posters, and a teenage boy dressed up like the Grim Reaper. But to me, this strange sight was the culmination of all the hard work that I, along with all my other club members, had put into a single event. The Climate Finance Integrity awareness campaign had been a project that the club that I had founded, Transparency SFS, had been working on tirelessly for the past months. Perhaps it was this same tenacity and passion for global change that turned a simple email to the managing director of Transparency Korea, one of the branches of the international NGO Transparency International, into something so much bigger. Our partnership with the global organization started from an interest in anti-corruption which was fueled by the Park Geun-hye scandal plaguing our own country's government. Only a few weeks later, I was told that I would be in charge of leading an awareness campaign along with my other club members in the busy streets of Seoul. I lead my club in designing brochures about our cause and creating huge poster-boards with surveys pedestrians could fill out. We bought a huge inflatable globe and a Grim Reaper costume as a way to attract the attention of passersby. As my first time in leading large-scale event, it would be a lie to say I didn't have my doubts. Would my leadership fail miserably? Would people even care about our cause?But standing in the cold streets with my peers, united by a single passion, I realized the size of the crowd we attracted was not what mattered. It was the fact that we were there, trying to bring awareness to something we believed in. I learned that leadership is so much more than just being in charge. It is taking that first initiative to turn something small into something meaningful. After all, who knew a single email would turn into a 40-people event?",,,

28,Admitsee,3,,2,3,,5,,"Left!' Five hundred legs from five rows of cadets hit the ground with a resounding thud in response to the drill sergeant. 'Right!' The morning air is crisp. A slight drizzle blends in with the beads of sweat dripping down my face. 'Left!' A dribble of liquid reaches my lips-not the cold neutral flavor of rain, but a distinct warm metallic taste.Blood. It gushes out as my heart rate increases, making me look like a guest of the Red Wedding. Why am I, a short, unathletic night owl awake at 4:30 AM and running at the United States Military Academy West Point?Because I wanted to do what I thought was impossible.When a family friend bragged about attending West Point Summer Leaders Experience, I didn't think much of it because there was no way I could survive physically. After joining football on a whim freshman year and ending the season with a concussion and a broken foot, I threw out my dreams of being a varsity athlete. Over the course of sophomore year, all of my athleticism eroded away as my abs turned into flabs and the steel hard thighs gained from daily deadlifts became mush. Yet, the thought of getting back in shape and trying new activities kept nagging at me. After a year of not doing any workouts aside from PE class, I went on my first run.I sucked.I went from sprinting a seven-minute mile freshman year to barely grinding through my first run with a combination of jogging, walking, and undignified, doglike panting. Seeing this dramatic shift made me realize just how much I declined, which motivated me to get back in shape. Going to West Point became a far-off goal to measure how much I improved; I wanted to be able to hold my own against all of the D1 recruited athletes who attended. To be honest, I also really wanted to shoot a rocket launcher.1 mile down. My lungs begin to tighten. Later, I will realize that struggling to breathe isn't normal when I become diagnosed with asthma. But in this moment, I simply focus on my goal: move my feet forward. Left. Right. Left. Right.If there is a word to describe me, it's persistent. Defeat is a foreign notion to me. The fitness requirements for West Point seemed daunting for someone who hadn't worked out for a whole year. But I pushed through, one rep at a time, one foot in front of another every morning before school. Slowly but surely, the number of pushups, sit-ups, and pull-ups, as well as my mile time, improved. While it was hard to justify my suffering when my sore and shaking arms couldn't even use a pipette in morning AP Bio labs, I soldiered on because quitting would be admitting defeat, confirming that I cannot accomplish the impossible.1.5 miles down. Still bleeding and breathing heavily, a mechanical determination drives me down the field. 'Left, right, left, right...' beats like a metronome in my head. As I ignore the lactic acid buildup in my thighs, constriction in my chest, and blood spewing through my nose, I realize how my mental strength is stronger than any physical obstacle. Every signal in my body begs me to stop, but I refuse to yield.Ultimately my asthma disqualified me from pursuing a military career, but these moments of pushing past obstacles proved clarifying for me.I survive and march back to the barracks, straight into the shower without taking off my blood-caked clothes. The torrent of cold water batters off me, turning the ground and the dead cockroaches on it salmon pink. Against all odds, I, the short, unathletic night owl, made it.If I could conquer what I thought was impossible, what will stop me in the future?Left. Right. Left. Right.",,,
29,Admitsee,3,1,2,3,,5,,"I always conflicted over the desire to hide my 'differences' or embrace my Korean heritage. Ashamed of being Asian, I never imagined myself to one day lead others to accept their differences. In freshman year, I partook in a program where I was taught valuable lessons about stereotyping, tolerance, empathy, and the importance of diversity. At the end of that day, I wanted to serve as a leader next. I joined the organization called Griffins With A Mission (GWAM) every year after that. As a leader, I encouraged the freshmen to respect oneself and others. It was with GWAM that I realized to appreciate my individuality. I am not inferior for having a lower economic status or being Asian, and in the same way others are not inferior to me. GWAM allows me to convey these realizations to others, and I still carry the lessons it taught me today. My dad was diagnosed with a late stage of colon cancer when I was in the fifth grade. At that time, I could not completely grasp what was going on and only knew that my dad was going away for a few months to receive his operation. My mom soon became the sole breadwinner in the family. A month into my dad's departure, the bills started piling up on our kitchen counter. Today, my family is still recovering from those medical costs. To make ends meet, my parents sold their small business and drifted to and from multiple odd jobs. I have experienced what economic hardship does to people as I saw my mom suffer both physically and mentally from our situation. A few years later in high school, I came to the understanding and realization of how much my parents sacrificed to keep us afloat and afford academic opportunities for me. The struggle of my parents to care for us while providing in times of illness and emergency became my inspiration and driving force. With this newfound clarity, I took it upon myself to challenge and push myself harder in school. Not only did I want to make my parents proud, but I wanted to prove something to myself. I took the most advanced classes offered at my school and finally obtained a 5.0 GPA in my Junior year. Through my achievements I demonstrated to my parents, as well as to myself, my capabilities in balancing schoolwork on top of my extracurriculars, piano lessons, and volunteer work. However, none of this was easy. Several times, I felt like giving up when it seemed like my work had no end. But in these difficult moments, I persevered by recalling the sacrifices and resilience of my parents. Now, I commit myself to academic excellence not just for myself but also for my parents. I believe in attaining a successful future to continue the dream of America my parents sought while crossing the Pacific Ocean for their children's futures. As a Korean from the Asian Pacific American Islander (AAPI) community, I recognized how taboo the subject of 'mental health' was among many first-generation immigrants. Fortunately, I became aware of the topic during my early teenage years scrolling through posts on my Tumblr feed. Soon, my interest in psychology rose in because it is interconnected with concepts on how and why the brain functions and degrades the way it does. My fascination in the matter only grew when I took AP Psychology my junior year in high school. Because of this interest, when the opportunity to create my own research project came to me in collaboration with Capstone, I was stoked to research mental illness. With my awareness I understood how under-discussed but important the subject of mental illness is, so I wondered how my fellow classmates felt. I had a positive point of view on the matter meaning I don't see mentally challenged individuals as people to be pitied or 'different'. However, I knew the negative stigma surrounding it and wondered if my peers reflected those views. I created a survey with questions on how one perceives mental illness, where those perceptions come from (the community, culture, social media), and what causes them to have those perceptions. My results surprised me in that most of my surveyed classmates held positive impressions like me and more than half indicated they knew someone who had been diagnosed with mental illness. This proved to me how prevalent mental illness is and how psychology can be used to broaden those realizations. Psychology is a powerful subject that widened my understanding of others and formulated questions in me that I sought to answer. I was a shy and reserved person growing up, never taking risks to make myself vulnerable. I was constantly bogged down by feelings of inferiority due to my socioeconomic background in comparison to my white and affluent classmates. It was not up until high school that I learned to stand up for myself and challenge my insecurities. Junior year, I created a club to raise awareness about animal welfare, which is one of my passions. Through that experience, I found myself leadings meetings attended by over sixty members. I volunteered to be a mentor for the younger peers leading discussions on empathy, racial hatred, and stereotypes. For the first time, I took the initiative to approach others instead of waiting to be approached. Today, I am eager to put myself into new environments and appreciate the growth that new experiences give me. During the summer of 2017, I participated in an exchange program that placed me in Quanzhou, China. At first, I harbored prejudices and misgivings about a foreign nation like China. But by placing myself in a completely unfamiliar setting without the supervision or guidance of my parents, my sense of independence and resourcefulness thrived. I connected with the local Chinese despite a language barrier and carried out my responsibilities without being told to do so. My time abroad and growing sense of confidence over the course of high school has readied me for the new challenges that will be brought on in college. The development in my self-awareness, global perspective, and my inclination to lead others will make me a successful individual seasoned for the prestige of the University of California schools. I am thrilled by the potential for further growth and believe in my capabilities to flourish in this institution. I was always a shy, reserved person growing up, never taking risks to make myself vulnerable. I was constantly bogged down by feelings of inferiority because of my socio-economic background and compared myself to my white, affluent classmates. I felt unlucky to be Asian and fantasized about how different life would be if I were 'white'. It was not until high school that I started to stand up for myself and be proud of who I am. Tired of hiding my true identity, I took the initiative to push myself and challenge my insecurities. I created a club to raise awareness about animal welfare, an issue of great importance to me. Suddenly, I found myself leading a meeting with over 60 members with the same interest. I volunteered to be a mentor for freshmen and lead discussions on empathy, racial hatred, and stereotypes. To my younger peers, I shared stories about my experiences that they could learn from. I took the initiative to approach others and emerge from my comfortable social bubble. Upon reflection, I learned to value these experiences because of the ways they made me grow. Soon after, I would quite literally step outside my comfort zone. During the summer of 2017, I participated in an exchange program that placed me in Quanzhou, China. For over two weeks, I lived with a host family, exploring the culture, traditions, and historical sites of a smaller Chinese city. The program allowed me to develop close-knit relationships with the people and gain a more intimate understanding of the culture, rather than losing myself in a chaotic metropolis like Beijing or Shanghai. Initially, I was afraid of going to a foreign country by myself. I was filled with concerns about how dirty China would be, the danger of being in a communist country, and uneasiness about how Chinese people were 'not nice.' However, these worries dissipated almost instantly as my host family welcomed me with utmost consideration and introduced me to everything Quanzhou had to offer.In Quanzhou, people lead lifestyles dramatically different from those to which I am accustomed. From concerns about food and transportation, to human interactions and language barriers, I worried that I would have difficulty assimilating to my new environment and associating with a foreign people. But despite our differences, I found myself connecting with my host family. I bonded with my host sister, the only one who could speak English, over complaints about the unbearable humidity, laughed over the same jokes, shared meals and confessed thrilling secrets. Through this program, Quanzhou and its people became more than an unknown, unimportant city to me. My home for those two weeks became a real community filled with individuals living real lives. My invaluable experience in China gave me the strength to overcome my feelings of internalized shame and inferiority. My host family taught me to accept my cultural, racial, and economic differences through their openness to share their own culture. Looking back, I became cognizant of my own prejudices about a place that I had never been. In addition, the trip also developed my sense of independence. I left home afraid of going to a foreign country without the security of any friends or family. But instead, I returned with new friends and met a supportive host family. In this entirely new setting, I learned to hold myself accountable for my own actions and decisions. No one told me how to behave or speak, so I became more conscious of how I portrayed myself as a person. The times in China have prepared me to be a more adept individual comfortable with new environments and people. I owe the growth of my confidence in who I am and what I can do to this experience. Now, I am ready to face any challenges that may come my way because I treasure how they will cultivate me as an individual.",,,

32,Admitsee,3.5,,,3,,5,6,"The sun crept over the horizon, gradually illuminating the brick buildings with shades of orange and purple. It was only 6am, yet the town was already buzzing. Cars and buses sped up and down the streets, zooming towards the sprawled-out plazas among the few lakes and trees. Droves of people entered the many shops for their morning breakfast before work. I observed all of these events as I was watching the sunrise from the top of a sledding hill one morning. What a lively scene, I thought to myself. Everyone is up and about quite early. Vernon Hills is a town that I am proud of. From past constructions of infrastructure to recent renovations of the mall and old plazas, the community I know is one that is constantly developing, innovating, and trying to better the quality of life for everyone. Its focus on commercial activity has built a strong foundation for educational success and has created numerous opportunities for employment and personal growth. Yet something felt awfully wrong about that scene. It wasn't the livelihood of the town. Neither was it the possible disturbance of the morning quiet. Could it be the economic dichotomy existing between the two sides of the town: Gregg's Landing and the other neighborhoods? Indeed, there was a sharp financial contrast between the two parts of town, one filled with grandiose houses and pristine lawns, and the others, lackluster, grey structures with barely enough grass to be considered a lawn. No. The issue was much deeper than that. It was not until I participated in a classroom discussion of the racially-driven divisions that I discovered what had bothered me that very day. As I was pondering on top of that hill, behind me was one of the poorer, adjacent neighborhoods to Gregg's Landing. There lived the Hispanics, Middle Easterners, and other minorities, reminded daily of their misfortunes by the towering houses less than a mile to their side. With a few exceptions, those living in Gregg's Landing were predominantly white. Something did not make sense. Vernon Hills boasted of its diversity and continually pushed for equality. I also learned that segregation was outlawed years ago in 1954 in all my history classes.Then how could this economic segregation occur right before my eyes, nearly 60 years after its abolishment! I am still deeply troubled by this astonishing discovery. There is no way to abolish this implicit sort of segregation; it's subtle form is far more frightening than when it had legality. How are the citizens of Vernon Hills supposed to combat something that is not explicit but still pervading all of society? I have no answers, but I know that if nothing is done to address this underlying problem, no matter how financially successful or how stable the educational system is, the racial barriers will continue to be reinforced. I fear that Vernon Hills will fall back into the darkness. The first step must be to illuminate this extensive issue, whether quickly or gradually.",Showing,Setting,
33,Admitsee,3.5,,,,,,6,"A sea of fuchsia-stained nuclei appeared in my field of vision. The neurons in the spider's brain were like pomegranate seeds, thousands squished into each of the brain's lobes. Layers upon layers, a beaded sculpture made from cells with neural connections twining them together. How many neurons could there be? And if such a small creature possessed so many neurons, what about humans? I tried to scale up my mental sculpture to match, but I failed to conjure up the billions of pomegranate seeds needed.I was in a lab at St. Michael's College in Vermont examining the impact of overstimulation on the neural connections of the C. salei spider. Spiders that experienced overstimulation showed signs of neurodegeneration, as if the pomegranate seeds in the spiders' brains had rotted. This phenomenon may play a role in the development of human diseases like Alzheimer's or multiple sclerosis. I was fascinated by this similarity between spider and human brains\u2014it amazed me that research on one species could teach us so much about another.Yet, I couldn't stop thinking about how similar two human brains could be\u2014specifically, my twin brother's and my own.Our alikeness has manifested itself in every possible way, from our looks to our thoughtful, compassionate personalities. Our biggest similarity is our love of classical music. While Bach, Haydn, and Mendelssohn make our peers yawn, dopamine and serotonin flood our brains when we dive into the intricacies of the music. But as I entered high school, I grew tired of having a near clone. We were always 'the Wu's,' mutually reinforcing parts of a larger whole. Hoping to find a niche only I could occupy, I turned to cross country and Nordic skiing, but Henry's presence still haunted me. In races, cheers of 'Go Henry!' would ring out from parents and friends, commonly followed by alarmed whispers of 'Oh wait, was that Nathan?!' Even when I thought I had finally found a passion that was purely my own in the form of biological research, Henry promptly got involved as well, helping out in the very same lab.Yet, one day, while performing Brahms's 'Sonatensatz' together at an honors recital, something amazing happened. We took our spots\u2014Henry at the piano, me in front of him, violin in hand. After a restless introduction, we broke out into the energetic first theme, matching each other's driving triplet rhythms note for note. I had tried so hard to find paths that took me in a different direction from Henry, yet here I was, right in step with him. As we moved together with the gentle swells of the trio section, my mind drifted to my spider research. I imagined pomegranate seeds sending shoots out to touch other seeds, spurred on by our soaring melody. Suddenly, I realized it didn't matter that spider and human brains\u2014or even twins' brains\u2014behave in the same way. The whole point was to examine how external effects cause the brain to develop differently. Variations and similarities are not inborn but develop through experience, so no two brains are exactly alike\u2014not even those of twins. A year after my research at St. Michael's and ten months after our recital, I have come to terms with the fact that I did not need to be so worried about being too similar to Henry all these years. Our differentiation from each other was inevitable. Our now-unique passions would have flourished of their own accord. Now, I have a new preoccupation\u2014enjoying our final year together. We will likely attend different colleges, and life's events will push us apart as we pursue different careers and journey into adulthood. As our paths diverge, so will our neural networks, forced by experiences that we do not both encounter. We will lose the many bonds we share. Now is the time, not for finding differences between us, but for celebrating our brotherhood.",,,

37,Admitsee,3.5,,,3,,5,6,"Dingdong!' Every five minutes, the bell rang ominously. One by one, patients arose from their waiting room seat and disappeared into the exam room. My mother and I waited for our turn to come, and I with each passing ringing of the bell, I became more anxious, while she remained unflustered. Her deafness, it seemed, had a small benefit. She had begun going deaf during her pregnancy, when an allergic reaction to an antibiotic damaged her ears. So, every year we took my mother to one of the largest hospitals in Seoul to have the otolaryngologist check her hearing aid. When our bell rang, we entered the exam room and sat before the doctor. Then, just a few minutesinto our conversation, the next bell rang, and the doctor rapidly scribbled a prescription note, after which the nurse ushered us out.Even though some patients came from distant islands to see the doctors, no medical exam could last more than five minutes. Because the hospital could not afford more doctors, treatments sped along at the rapid rhythm of the ceaseless bell. In Korea's push to provide universal care, it had undermined the quality of care. When I think about the challenge of providing care that is both excellent and broadly available, the sound of the unforgiving bell haunts me. There had to be a better way. Basic economics asserts that technological advancement will shift both the supply and demand curves to the right, thereby increasing the overall number of patients offered medical service while quality remains unchanged. I began wondering how I could use more advanced modeling to improve both efficiency and quality.At first, I worried that math was too theoretical to provide solutions to a real-world problem. As I developed a more nuanced understanding of mathematics, I learned that math provided simple and broadly applicable rules that, if used creatively, could generate answers to nearly any problem. In college, I discovered data science in a statistics course, and I wondered if it could be used to generate insights into healthcare. For my final research paper in the class, I analyzed how rising administration costs in healthcare are associated with increased complexity of health insurance. However, the analysis could not be done without solving the limitation from a 1950s healthcare administration dataset. I used the data in subtle ways to derive patients' genders using an array of clues. I enjoyed crafting the code and felt the same sense of accomplishment I had felt while excelling in high school math and physics competitions, except in this instance I saw the immense potential practical value of using math to solve problems like rising health insurance rates. When I began college, I had done so intending to become a doctor, but the more I explored data science,the more I realized that I could use data to improve the lives of entire populations. Indeed, the thought of using math in a practical manner that helped real people was genuinely exciting for me.I explored data science at a deeper level during a research internship at the Korea EconomicResearch Institute, where I interpreted R codes for non-data scientists. Our team of data scientists identified patterns in healthcare costs and quality of healthcare using nationwide datasets, capturing the underlying problems of universal healthcare. Again, I heard the bell ringing and understoodthat it was a problem throughout Korea. Moreover, by takingonline data science courses from Coursera and through arranging conversations with researchers, I began to see that my skills and interests were those that an adept data scientist possesses. I loved the idea of doing work thatleveraged creativity and logic to solve real-world problems through team-based cooperation.Throughout Korea, the tell-tale 'dingdong' sound still haunts the waiting rooms ofgovernment hospitals. I dream that one day my mother can sit in front of a doctor who can examine and converse with her without dreading the interruption of an unforgiving timer. Data science willempower me to make this dream a reality.During my third year working as a research assistant in the Department of Psychology in Korea University, I landed a volunteer position at Seoul's Public Internet Addiction Recovery Center.When I arrived at the center, I was assigned to three elementary students: Kangmin, Hyunjae, and Jaehyuk. All three sat with their legs shaking and their eyes glued to their smartphones while I asked them questions about their Internet use. Their school transcripts contained poor grades, and their attendance records were unsatisfactory. Observing them gave me goosebumps, as I had been the same way in seventh and eighth grade. Two hours of trying to get them to open up to me wasn't working. So I asked them if they wanted to skip this discussion and play games at the local PC caf\u00e9 instead. They nodded excitedly, so we sneaked out just the way my seventh-grade P.E. teacher did with me, except he had the principal's permission. Every day for four hours, we met at the center and went straight to the caf\u00e9. Four hours of gaming was nothing to game-addicted students, who usually played 14 hours a day. Using my P.E. teacher's tactic helped me get to know them. Kangmin began gaming to cope with stress from demanding schoolwork. Hyunjae was overwhelmed by the expectations his family had for him. Jaehyuk was being forced by bullies play games using their accounts to break the highest score records.Understanding the motives behind their addictive behavior was very helpful in finding solutions. Kangmin was transferred to a less rigorous school to give him more freedom to explore his academic interests. We introduced Hyunjae's parents to a consultant and persuaded them to be more encouraging of Hyunjae's accomplishments. As for Jaehyuk, we contacted the School Violence Measures Autonomy Committee of the school to discipline the bullies and protect Jaehyuk from further harassment. With such success, I was acknowledged as a Student Leader at the center the following year.In high school I realized that I had glossophobia, fear of public speaking. My anxiety was so severe that I had to take prescribed medication before any class presentation, but the medication caused uncomfortable symptoms of its own. It numbed my body in an intense way, causing me to just spill out my words without being able to feel or engage with the audience.Wanting to rid myself of glossophobia, I had always run for various leadership positions, volunteered to present ideas during small-group discussions, and initiated small talk with strangers. Although I made small improvements, I still needed to depend on the medication.I didn't give up: I entered the campaign for Class Vice President. It required giving a Vice President Candidate speech in front of the entire class, and I promised myself I would not take any medication. I started speaking up more in class and volunteered during small-group presentations. I also participated in short five-minute presentation assignments. I wrote my VP speech a month before the speech date and practiced until I memorized it by heart. I was determined to overcome glossophobia by proving to myself that I could successfully give a major speech. I wanted this so badly that I did not even report other candidates when I saw them breaking the rules of the campaign, even though I could easily disqualify them. I wanted to win solely through my own performance.At last, the day of the VP speech finally came, and I gave it my all--without mistakes, without medication. All I heard after I finished were my peers shouting my campaign slogan 'Go Ham!' Unfortunately, I had lost the campaign due to a vote separation in the senior class--a junior girl was the sole candidate in her class--but I knew I had overcome glossophobia. And I realized how much I loved making speeches. I made eye-contact with the audience, pointed out each class, and made the audience laugh and cry. It was an incredible feeling to know I was no longer controlled by fear.Because of my excessive gaming in middle school, I often slept in and skipped school, yet was in denial of my addiction. My GPAs at the time were 1.25, 1.38, and 1.00 (out of 4.00). My father, a psychiatrist, tried everything to help me. The school principal, my homeroom teacher, my best friends, and Ms. Oh--the most famous pediatric psychiatrist in Korea--counseled me to help me get back to school. After completing the first semester of eighth grade, our family moved to Pittsburgh. During the first week of school, I received a score of zero out of fifty on the '50 U.S. States Test' in history class. My teacher had given me a chance to retake the test. So I printed a copy of the U.S. map and began studying. I realized it only took me seven minutes to memorize twenty states. I made songs and flashcards to memorize more. Soon, I ended up memorizing all fifty. I realized that my gaming addiction had conditioned me to think that I was incapable of studying. This simple history test shattered this fear and reignited my desire to learn. Since then, I began taking my studies very seriously. I set short-term goals and enjoyed small wins on my own. Every time I completed an assignment or aced a test, it boosted my self-esteem. At the end of the year, I was prized a tablet for having the highest GPA in middle school. I was happy, but I broke the tablet in half as a promise that I would never let myself break down because of technology.I still use an old iPhone 5 that dies in 40 minutes and takes 50 seconds to load an application as a reminder of my past. My friends laugh at it, but really, so many youngsters are consumed with their phones, unable to socialize without it or concentrate. I still am an advocate of technological advancement, but I will always be aware of its potential drawbacks.I have been serving as a Peer Mentor at my school since tenth grade. Peer Mentors supervise incoming students by helping them adjust to school life. During school orientation programs, they meet with these students daily. I wanted to be involved in peer mentoring because I knew all too well what it was like to be a new kid in school. Throughout my school years, I have moved schools about six times. Through this position, I was able to meet students from all grades. Every year, students enter our school from all around the world, some coming from countries I have never even heard of. These students stand out as 'different' and face the daunting task of assimilating to school culture and making a healthy circle of friends. From clich\u00e9 ice-breaker activities to forming bonds through outdoor challenging activities such as survival camping, our Peer Mentors help them get to know one another and adapt to school life.I also mentored a senior who was struggling with substance abuse issues and depression. As a former game addict, I could relate to his state, so I took great care to reach out to him. His state was quite severe, however, so he was often irritable and unapproachable. It was difficult for me to watch him suffer and I sometimes doubted whether I could help him.I persuaded our Chief Residential Assistant to allow a two-month rehabilitation period for him. Since the local clinic lacked the necessary resources, we needed to take a two-hour drive to the Drug Rehabilitation Center for a more comprehensive program. I did my best to support him as a friend during this time. I also consulted my father, a psychiatrist. I stayed in touch with the student throughout winter break.Although he was not completely drug-free, he significantly decreased substance use and was able to stay in school. He is now a freshman at Penn State studying psychology and stays in touch with me by sharing what he's learning about the field.",,,

Even when the air conditioning fails in the scorching 110-degree heat of Northridge, California. Even when everything that could go wrong\u2026 goes wrong.Throughout my classical training, I've always had a sense of consistency and forethought drilled into me. My fingers need to be precise to a 64th of an inch on my violin, my brain needs to calculate the interlocking pattern of polyrhythms, and my feet need to adjust miniscule degrees of incline on the pedals. So naturally, when the spotlights disappeared and the AC broke with a deafening whoosh, I froze. For a split second, all I could hear was the hitch of my breath and my arteries pulsating behind my ears. As I've come to learn, music is undoubtedly an art - a language that exists to resonate with a part of the soul untouchable with words. But music is also a science. A science that creates dissonance and resolution from pitch and frequency. A science that makes the progression to the tonic in the second movement of Rachmaninoff's 2nd Concerto elicit such a tug on the heartstrings. To me, music comes to life when embracing the dichotomy of art and science. Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6 has four pages of intensely fast octaves that require exceptional stamina and strength. After six months of laborious work, I felt that I had finally found my music. Previously, piano had merely been the extracurricular that my parents wouldn't let me quit. For the first time, I felt as if the piece was my own. I felt powerful and original. But in the summer of 2017, just as I was nearing peak performance, I crashed. My right pinky finger's sagittal band ruptured, and I went from the brilliance of Liszt to barely being able to play hot cross buns. Doctors told me I would need an eight-week vacation from piano and while 10-year-old me would have jumped for joy, newly passionate me was devastated. That is, until I found that the orthopedic clinic was my heaven. I was enraptured by the machines, the equipment, and the interactions. The rush I experienced when playing the Liszt returned upon finding the dichotomy of art and science that I craved. My days were spent learning how to tape my hand, how to use the ultrasound, and how to mold casts. I fell in love with the prospect of becoming an orthopedic hand specialist because I could explore my curiosity about medicine while focusing on the mechanisms of a musician. And in the absence of a glaring spotlight, I realized that I never would have discovered such a passion without everything going wrong. Darkness shrouded the hall, with the audience in nervous restlessness and the sweltering heat creeping through the auditorium. All I could hear was an anxious wave of murmurs. An incapacitating fear washed over me, my mind disoriented after being jerked from the comfort of predictability I had previously relied on. But as I clutched my dress, a twinge of pain in my finger reminded me of how rewarding it is to persevere through the unpredictable. I inhaled deeply. I wasn't in a play. There was no deus ex machina waiting backstage to make everything okay. I needed to do this myself. My fingers unclenched the mesh of my gown one by one, and I took my place. As the piano bench squeaked against the stage, the audience hushed in silent wonder, awaiting my cue. A small smile graced my lips; the drama had both me and my listeners on the edge of our seats. I raised my hands to the familiar black and white keys to play in the dark, humid concert hall. Because, ladies and gentlemen, the show must go on.",,,

It takes a medium \u2013 a surface, instrument, or platform \u2013 to express even the most imaginative ideas.Peering through the microscope, I observe the tiny worms squirming on agar and munching on bacteria. Wielding a platinum wire, I decontaminate my weapon with a Bunsen burner; my eyes settle on a single worm. Slowly advancing my worm-pick like a jaguar hunting its prey, I snatch it up and drown it in buffer, where its DNA will be collected for sequencing analysis.

The elementary school classroom buzzes with vibrant energy as students each grab a pencil, two dice, and a piece of paper. A young boy named Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.In the summer of 2019, I arrived on the campus as a curious and ambitious high school student. Armed with an exciting opportunity as an intern, I took a particular interest in a project creating uniquely gene-edited strains of C. elegans. In the following weeks, I sought to generate a new mutant strain for neuron-specific gene expression. However, I would soon face no shortage of challenges.In early July, I rubbed my eyes in disbelief. I expected a neat array of brightly colored bands corresponding to mutant DNA on my agarose gel, but all I saw were randomly scattered bands in the wrong positions. Feeling the frustration boiling in my blood, I agonized myself for ruining this critical experiment. Disheartened, I retreated to my desk, intent on finding a solution.With only three weeks left, I raced against the clock. Frequenting the hallways in search of guidance, I struck up conversations with lab technicians and postdocs alike. Each suggestion was carefully noted and tested the next day, hoping for success. At the next lab meeting, I presented my project and sought advice from my mentor and other labmates. With the whiteboard sprawled with progeny maps and experimental setups, we approached the problem from different angles and brainstormed new ideas.It was in the midst of a thoughtful discussion that I suddenly had my 'Aha!' moment. Quickly, I put forth a new strategy to create more specificity in my polymerase chain reactions, which would increase the probability of a successful experiment. Invigorated by this new approach, I worked long weekends to carefully perform experiments until I was greeted with a definite indicator of my success: a beautiful string of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs perfectly complementing my original design. Beaming with pleasure, I took pride in finally resolving the issue and achieving this colorful sequence of DNA.My experience has taught me the importance of listening to diverse ideas in the collaborative environment of research. Embracing varied perspectives and different opinions can help me broaden my horizons and lead to future success.Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and\/or outside of the classroom. Growing up with both of my parents working in the pharmaceutical industry, I was the audience for frequent science-related talks during long car rides. Although most were far beyond my grasp, I was always curious about my dad's work on metabolic mechanisms and drug development. The light exposure gained from these impromptu road lectures ignited a scientific spark inside me, inspiring me to learn more on my own. As I progressed through my high school science classes, one particular subject captured my curiosity: chemistry. Intrigued by the notion of minuscule atoms shaping all matter around me, I explored the countless real-world applications of chemistry through informational YouTube videos and rabbit holes of Wikipedia articles. Seeking opportunities outside of class to further my interest, I assembled a team of six students to compete in the Washington University Chemistry Tournament (WUCT) in St. Louis. Coordinating weekly meetings to practice problems and showcase lab demonstrations, I guided my teammates through cool experiments, carefully performing procedures ranging from pen ink chromatography to pickle juice titrations and iodine clocks. During the team round at WUCT, we worked on problem after problem, conjuring up reaction schemes and solving equilibrium systems together. Smiling fondly at the messy spread of papers representing the culmination of our hard work, I felt proud knowing our team's collaborative efforts came to fruition.Chemistry inspires me to see everyday things differently \u2013 pencil lead as intricately connected layers of graphite and Sprite as an acidic mixture of carbon dioxide and lemon-lime flavored water. It is a world full of limitless creative potential and hidden molecular wonders, and it is one I plan to explore much further in the future.What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?The elementary school classroom buzzes with vibrant energy as students each grab a pencil, two dice, and a piece of paper at the weekly math tutoring session. A young boy named Beyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admission to the University of California? While working full-time and caring for a family, my mom made countless sacrifices in her pursuit of a law degree. As a child, I constantly felt her absence and longed for 'law school' to stop keeping her away from me. However, as I grew older, my mom began to describe to me her assignments - approaching cases from different angles, examining past rulings to support arguments, and so much more. Only then did I understand her undying commitment to education. I strove to follow in her footsteps, staying after class to ask burning questions in order to learn more. I had ignited a zeal for discovery, which would drive my educational approach for the next six years and beyond.Eager to cultivate this inner curiosity, I seized an opportunity to explore my cultural background through a six-week experience in Shanghai the summer after eighth grade. Immersed in a foreign environment on my own, I felt nervous and scared. At first, I was reluctant to connect with my host family, fearing I would make a bad impression with my Americanized-Chinese accent. However, recalling my mom's journey from arriving in America barely speaking fluent English to graduating from law school, I became determined to practice my second language. Drawing upon years of weekend Chinese school and phone calls with my grandparents, I began to welcome opportunities to develop the authenticity of my accent. It soon became normal for me to strike up conversations with strangers on the subway. I let my curiosity flourish, tasting delicacies like stinky tofu at night markets and growing a profound appreciation for Tai Chi. I learned that by coming out of my shell, I could embrace the world around me and appreciate everything it has to offer.Today, my love of learning evokes the same unwavering dedication my mom carried throughout her journey. I am grateful to her for bestowing upon me a thirst for knowledge that fuels my ambition and embodies my academic philosophy. By refusing superficial explanations and simple solutions, I will continue exploring all aspects of my life and learning from everything I do.",,,

43,Admitsee,3.5,1,,,,5,,"I walk in and take a deep breath, catching the smell of roasted coffee beans as it tickles my nose. With no time wasted, I beeline towards the queue for coffee that has formed in front of my eyes. Soon it's my turn to order. Immediately, I realize something is different\u2014the barista at the cash register is unfamiliar. I know all the baristas here, so who is this man? I sneak a peek at the nametag: Peter. His swoopy hair and dark eyebags peeking out underneath his glasses seem to indicate he is a first-year college student juggling work with school. His unrecognizable face strikes a curiosity within me, causing me to blurt out, 'Are you new here?'Taken aback by my use of mouth for something other than ordering coffee, his bewilderment turns into appreciation. As we converse, I learn Peter's story: a recent college grad with aspirations to become a psychologist. Our conversation is cut short by the lengthening queue; I order and am presentednot only with a cup of joe but a newfound acquaintance.Having grown up a Seattleite, the coffee shop culture is unavoidable. I am attracted to the jazzy music, the light chit chatter, the warm atmosphere. Yet what's truly fascinating is the people. People of all walks of life descend on the coffee shop to inhale their daily caffeine. They model a spectrum of maturity, boundless opportunities, and limitless stories. I see a tall man tersely speaking into a phone, his leg anxiously shaking. Maybe he got into a fight with his significant other, or is in the middle of a call with an unhappy boss. I spot a woman sitting, headphones in, laptop out, consulting a notebook stock full of furious scribbling. Perhaps a freelance journalist writing a piece about an unsolved murder mystery? Or possibly a scientist analyzing data from her most recent experiment?I indulge on the endless possibilities, surfing between the lines of fiction and reality. I close my eyes and dream of a musical number, using the characters of the coffee shop as the stars of the show. The sitting woman and the tall man sing an emotional ballade while I occupy space as a background dancer\u2014a scene far from realism yet straight out of an episode of Glee. I open my eyes and see the tall man still talking on his phone, sitting woman still consulting her notes. Reality resumes.To me, the coffee shop is larger than life. Not only does it grant patrons the energy to function in the mornings, but connects people to people\u2014more importantly, connects people to stories, real or conceived, that give birth to countless inspirations.In essence, I am magnetized by stories. The coffee shop nurtures this interest, drawing me to activities where storytelling is the pinnacle. I undertake awkward social situations with the purpose of learning unique stories about people who would otherwise just be strangers; I play piano and violin because the music is open to interpretation, giving me a platform to tell a story; I enjoy teaching kids because their childlike wonder lets mine come out and play. Above all, I have an affinity for stories because I wish for my own life to be a well-crafted story: taking a wandering path of its own with a calculated resolve\u2014the perfect mix of freedom with control. Everything that I do, I do to propel my search for a story unique to me. And when my curiosity reaches a dead end, I instinctively wander back to the coffee shop to find directions for inspiration. I queue for coffee and wait as the infinitude of possibilities inevitably unfurl before me. I catch sight of Peter, exchanging a smile and wave. No longer a stranger, Peter has become another character in the cast of the coffee shop, handing me his story to fuel my imagination.I didn't realize how much the mere presence of a person can be comforting until I became a trained active listener on 7 Cups of Tea, an online counseling platform. Being an active listener means that I have the ability to chat with people seeking counseling by purely helping them articulate their feelings, not by giving them advice. Being an active listener is not about treating diagnoses, but instead about giving people an outlet to talk about their worries and fears with no strings attached.Active listening as a 'hobby' didn't feel real early on, but soon I developed the understanding that the people I talk to are not characters in a video game-they're real people, and every word I type matters. I remember the first person I talked to was a guy from Scotland. He wanted to join the army to fight for his country, to feel like his life had surmounted to something. It broke my heart to see the emotions he was dealing with, and I therefore made it my goal to help every person I talk to on the website forget about the darkness in their lives for just a few minutes a day. I would listen to what they wanted to talk about, comfort them, support them, encourage them, and then talk to them about things beyond the dimensions of their mental health. I would crack jokes, ask about their hobbies and passions, request music recommendations. Even though I was certified only to listen, I wanted them to feel like somebody truly cared about them. I failed to comprehend the full extent of what I was doing until a few weeks after I became an active listener. I had chatted with the guy from Scotland intermittently since, and the next time he messaged me, he was thanking me for listening to him. He told me that he always looked forward to talking to me because it made him feel a little better every day. It has never brought me more happiness to know I have the potential make a difference in somebody's life. 8:40 AM\u2014time for class. For the last time, I walk into my classroom full of tiny, screeching third graders. I had spent the previous two weeks teaching obnoxious little kids. Their nonstop mischievousness had me begging on my knees at the end of each day, pleading to somebody, anybody, that I would not have to spend another day dealing with devil children. Sure, I had shared many fun memories with them, but part of me was grateful I would not see these students ever again. So why did I feel a twisted knot of regret creeping up from the depths of my stomach? Whilst trying to grasp this feeling's meaning, I am approached by one of my kids. She wears a bright smile, yet her eyes are dark and dismal. 'Is today the last day?' she asks, eyebrows furrowed. I nod. 'And then you're gone forever?' It was rhetorical, but I nod anyways. Her arms cling onto mine. 'Don't leave. Why can't you stay?' She burrows her head into my shoulder to hide the tears. She looks up at me, smile now replaced with a frown, eyes now clouded with water. I reach down to wipe away her tears, attempting a laugh and telling her to smile. The twist in my stomach expands until the feeling is unavoidable. I can feel tears welling up in my own eyes. Why am I crying? 'You can't tell me not to cry if you're crying,' she teases, wiping away my tears as I had done for her. She pauses to unclasp a bracelet from her wrist, pressing it into my hands. She looks into my eyes with conviction, whispering, 'Don't forget me.' Don't forget me. Was she scared I would forget her, as if she meant nothing to me? To her, I was a role model. Yet what was she to me? All my life I had been my own best friend, enveloped in a world of apathy. As I cried with her bracelet in my hands, I wanted to stop feeling unattached towards people who deserve my love. I wanted to care again. What I lacked in my life was an acknowledgement of the cycle of trust and affection. Having been an adamant believer that I, alone, shaped myself into the person I am, I built a castle with walls that symbolized dependency as a liability. I vowed to be there for my loved ones in times of hardship, yet I closed the doors on the people who wanted to be there for me as I had been for them. Living in that expansive castle unaccompanied, I pretended the concept that people shape other people was not a necessity. However, well-worn structures require renovation, and my castle is no different. By gradually deconstructing my walls and installing a sturdy drawbridge, my newly improved castle makes sure that dependency can coexist with independency.Twirling the bracelet that sits snugly on my wrist, I smile in remembrance. 'I could never forget you.'Music is my creative outlet. Playing music, listening to music, analyzing music, you name it-every aspect of music fosters my creative expression. There is something so beautiful about music that transcends time and space, unlocking an infinitude of possibilities for inspiration. I started playing music when I was seven. What I love about playing music is that it is open to interpretation, giving me a platform to tell a story. The plain notes come to life in whichever way I decide to push and pull them, singing emotions that words cannot place. I started listening to an expansive amount of music when I was twelve. Now, you can turn on my phone at any given moment and catch me listening to dance or classical music, R&B, hip hop, heavy rock, or jazz. I listen to a broad range of music because each music genre helps me tap into particular feelings I may not be able to experience on a daily basis through my own accord. There's just something so stimulating about listening to music that spurs on my creativity, motivating me to unpack my emotions through written stories or drawn artworks. I started analyzing music quite recently, when I was sixteen. I began mainly because my piano teacher told me I needed to understand music theory better to assist in the ease of memorizing music. However, analyzing music composition has helped not only improve my memorization skills, but aided in my recognition of how other musicians channel their creative side through chord succession and musical inflections, subsequently inspiring me on my own creative endeavors. I dabbled into composing my own music in recent months, though I still have much to learn.Without music, my life would be incomplete. Music grants me the ability to discover the power of creativity, helping me craft stories that encapsulate my state of mind.As usual, my family and I were watching NBC Nightly News while eating dinner. I was contentedly chewing my food, when suddenly I heard Lester Holt declaring the death of Oliver Sacks, world-renowned neurologist. I stopped mid-chew. Although I knew nothing about neurology at the time, anything brain-related is captivating to me, so I made a mental note to search him up later and resumed my chewing.What unraveled that evening was an all-nighter dedicated to reading works by Oliver Sacks. I finished Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat, and, by the end of the week, devoured two more of his books. Nonfiction had never fascinated me as much as this; I felt inexplicably drawn to neuroscience as a career.If reading Sacks' books is a catalyst, many reactants-school, family, personal interest-were involved in the reaction itself to result in a product. My school may not offer neuroscience-related courses, but I got as close as I could; in biology we worked with Artificial Neural Networks, while psychology reinforced my love for the mind. My mom is a psychology major; her incessant interest with human behavior inspired mine. My grandfather has Alzheimer's; his incurable memory degeneration makes me wonder about the immense power of the brain. My interests led me to read articles, books in my free time; I now understand how neuroscience can be applied to technology (such as that being developed by Neuralink) and why it is a very important up-and-coming field of science.Sure, interest doesn't reflect reality. I haven't done much academically to go in depth into neuroscience and psychology. I haven't worked in a lab, haven't landed internships at a medical research center. However, what I do have is curiosity and perseverance. Lab skills can easily be learned. Passion cannot. 'I'm going to die before I finish college.' I used to tell myself this all the time. In my depression and anxiety-ridden brain, this recurring thought became an excuse to slack off. I did the bare minimum required to do well in school, I stopped practicing piano and violin as often because I didn't think it was important. I grew uninterested in learning, seeing no benefits of knowledge. I shut myself off from my friends and family, existing in a world where I was my own best friend. I forgot what it was like to be happy. I forgot what it was like to care about anything.It wasn't that I didn't want to get better-I just didn't know how. I tried meditating, coloring, and freewriting, but my options were limited, as I didn't want to burden anyone else with my troubles, adamantly believing I could survive through this alone. Even though I vowed to be there for my friends and family in times of hardship, I closed the doors on the people who wanted to be there for me as I had been for them. What I refused to acknowledge in my life was a cycle of trust and love. Then, in my junior year, I met a group of people that changed my emotional outlook. Their never-ending encouragement and acceptance gave me the strength to take control of how I live my life. Around them, I lost my anxiety and depression. I felt alive, I felt free. They helped me understand what it is like to live a life of kindness and laughter-of what it is like to trust and love. Soon, I began to look forward to waking up in the morning. I stopped viewing my past as a mistake and instead as a motivator. I stopped excusing my future as obsolete and instead as aspiration-filled. I openly express my appreciation for friends and family and prioritize the time we spend together. Learning makes me excited, music has become my creative experiment.",,Setting,Character
44,Admitsee,4,1,,,,5,,"A wooden house wider than taller stood in front of me. With run-down steps and a slanted sign-U-Pick Cherries-I almost laughed out loud. This was what we had driven five hours for? I sat down on a ladder under the shade, reveling in the breeze and watching my mom approach me with a basket of cherries resting against her hip. 'Just try one.'Mouth poised to protest, I then decided I didn't want to deal with fifteen minutes of her pestering me. Reluctantly, I opened my mouth. Maybe it was the scorching heat, for much to my surprise, I immensely enjoyed the refreshing cherries I so intensely despised before. I had been determined to hate and adhere to my previous opinion of them-irritating my mom would have been a pleasant bonus too. It's that mentality that I've tried to erode throughout the years. My mind builds up walls, designating what interests I can and cannot like, the activities I can and cannot do, and the passions I can and cannot pursue. Regretfully, I imagine the thousands of cherries I missed out on eating the first eight years of my life simply because I tried them two times before and determined I would never change my mind. It amuses me that now, I anticipate summer farmers' markets where I can buy my weekly indulgence: twenty pounds of cherries. Of course, most endeavors are not so surprising or rewarding. But I don't know until I try. After that eye-opening experience, I've made it my mission to be more willing to take risks. Some cherries aren't quite as easy to digest, however. Almost six years later from that trip to Yakima, I walked into my sales and marketing class as a nervous and naive freshman. As I chose events for DECA, an international business competition, flabbergasting interactions with my crush flashed through my mind. Without hesitation, my pen glided over 'improvisation' and 'roleplay' as I scoured for events with more preparation instead. I unconsciously limited myself, never realizing that I was simply ruining my own opportunity for growth. I passed two years of avoiding John (those beautiful blue eyes...) and those intimidating events, but when junior year arrived, my pen hovered over the roleplays. I almost dismissed them again, envisioning the judge's pained expression as I struggled with words for fifteen minutes. But I shrugging the hesitation and negativity out of my head. I was doing this for myself. I wanted to take a chance, and so what if I failed? So what if the judge internally laughed? I circled a roleplay.A medal now rests on my bedpost, reminding me every day of how far I have come. Placing second at state was nothing compared to the sense of self-accomplishment I felt standing onstage, though. Once I realized what I was working for, winning didn't matter. Rather, I had a chance to prove to myself that I could accomplish something I never thought I could. The event managers provide the prompt just thirty minutes before the roleplay. That preparation time is full of scribbling phrases on paper, pencil tapping, and calming my nerves. But I had preparation beyond that simple half hour. Ever since that experience at the cherry farm, I have taken risks, challenged my own mentality, and grown as a human. Though it took me time, I have gradually recognized the value of remaining openminded. Now, every day I find even the smallest of ways to venture into unexplored territory. I mix up my orders at The Cheesecake Factory, though I know I can never go wrong with the salted caramel cheesecake. I run different trails each weekend, discovering hidden spots of sunshine and meadows. I'm always on the hunt for cherries now-small, sweet surprises that refresh my outlook on life and remind me to step out of my comfort zone. And when I find them, I bite. My sister's finger precariously floated above the send button, poised to email our friends my 'affectionate' family nickname: Jujube. I was amazed that one click would have absolutely shattered my eight-year-old social life. Ever since, technology's ability to impact has fascinated me, drawing me to the field of computer science. Eager to learn more about the subject, I took it upon myself to craft a product for my club Club CAFE. After six weeks of debugging, despair, and dedication, I finally emerged with a JavaSwing application. Devising a management system that our board used for the rest of the year, and continues to use, immensely satisfied me. I marveled at my own ability and power: how did I produce a practical product just from tapping several keys? The hours of frustration creating pie charts with user input and account pages for different-access users faded away as I watched the other board members play around with my application\u2014an intense, giddy excitement bubbled in my stomach, the same intrigue that I had felt so many years before. During my Expedia apprenticeship, features such as recommendations and voice assistants came to life. I applied the problem-solving mindset I had developed previously to truly real-life applications, presenting me with a thrilling sense of accomplishment and a renewed excitement for coding.Unknowingly, computer science began to shape me in my day-to-day life. On the bus ride home, every day I read articles about new trends in the tech world. Fueled by a curiosity inherent to engineers, I took to learning more about Big Data and artificial intelligence. I began to recognize surrounding issues, an awareness that also carries engineers far; my mind wondered about solutions to improving technology-related issues, such as city traffic apps and vertigo from reading in moving vehicles. In a continually evolving world, I am motivated to contribute knowing that I can actively shape the future through each line of code, from reinventing routine actions to devising new ways to experience and appreciate life's blessings, such as the joys of sisterhood that that fateful iPad granted me so many years ago.My sister's finger precariously floated above the iPad's send button, poised to email our friends my 'affectionate' family nickname: Jujube. I was amazed that one click would have absolutely shattered my eight-year-old social life. Ever since, technology's ability to impact has fascinated me, drawing me to the field of computer science. Eager to learn more about the subject, eight years later I took IB Computer Science SL, which required a client project. After six weeks of debugging, despair, and dedication, I finally emerged with a JavaSwing application for Cultural Diversity Club. Devising a management system that our board used for the rest of the year, and continues to use, immensely satisfied me, reinforcing computer science as my future calling. But that passion for impact was amplified when I walked through the glass doors of Expedia, home of my summer apprenticeship. There, features such as recommendations and voice assistants came to life, all intending to streamline users' experiences and provide them with the best service possible. Similar to my in-class project, I applied the concepts and problem-solving mindset I had learned to real-life applications, presenting me with a thrilling sense of accomplishment and a renewed excitement for coding.How we travel, learn, and live changes constantly. I want to be the leader of that change. During my time at Expedia, one of the most significant issues discussed was the growth of artificial intelligence and the need to understand its full, often unforeseen implications. Artificial intelligence is only one among many other current buzzwords, such as big data and the Internet of Things. Participating in HackIllinois and attending Reflections | Projections are exciting ways for me to develop my exposure to and experience in these various facets of computer science. Delving deeper through ACM's special interest groups such as SIGAI would allow me to graduate with the knowledge to become an architect of technological growth. I hope to become a software developer or machine learning engineer to make a tangible difference in people's lives. By majoring in computer science at UIUC, I can grow the ability to actively shape the future through each line of code, from reinventing routine actions, such as communication, to devising new ways to experience and appreciate life's blessings, such as the joys of sisterhood that that fateful iPad had granted me so many years ago.I went from being an outspoken cherry-hater to a wholehearted cherry-lover. When May flowers begin to bloom, I eagerly rush to farmers' markets and collect my weekly indulgence: twenty pounds of cherries. Though I first abandoned my hatred of the fruit at eight years old, I still marvel at the extent of my cherry obsession. More than just a delectable, refreshing snack, they represent the beauty of surprises. My life has been a continual journey of self-discovery and self-growth, as I constantly demolish the walls my mind has unconsciously constructed to fully explore new interests and passions. Almost four years ago, I nervously walked into my freshman business class. Flabbergasting interactions with my crush flashed through my mind.

For the first time, I felt no pressure for my efforts to be validated, believing that I'd probably fail anyway.

49,Admitsee,4,1,,,,5,6,"Caitlin, for our debate, could you choreograph a spoken word dance expressing why the United States shouldn't employ a unilateral assault against terrorism?' I remembered rallying up the class with the Charleston, playing swing music to enhance our discussion about the culture of the 1920s Harlem Renaissance, so naturally, I blurted, 'Of course!'. As I walked to my next class, the gravity and relevance of the debate issue dawned on me. Panicking, I wondered: how would I effectively display the nuances of terrorism through contemporary dance? I found my answer in 'artivism', this portmanteau word combining art and activism, using the arts to revolutionize. Personally, dance as creative expression was far from foreign, but artivism was unknown. Beyond simply dancing, artivism meant physically and emotionally embodying the complications of terrorism, as the movement itself reflects the weight of these pressing issues. At that debate, I performed the contemporary piece as my opening statement, but this was merely a discovery that has allowed me to use dance to actively enact social change. On that day, everything that I had consciously ruminated on and practiced -- the heavy landings, the tense upper body -- were properly executed. The extended tendus and port de bras were elegant, but true artivism was something that I had yet to conquer.The proper execution of an arabesque or saut de chat, the technical complexities of a pirouette, the full extension of a tendu, no longer sufficed. Instead, the implications beneath the individual phrases in a spoken word poem, the issues regarding racial stereotypes and immigration controversies, were the true motivations behind the movement. Instead of landing softly and gracefully from grande jetes, now engrained into my muscle memory, I fell with immense weight to demonstrate the fear of women wearing burkas as they passed airport security. But the true difficulty lay beneath the movements themselves. Even before trying to ascertain how to portray these stereotypes and socioeconomic issues through dance, I needed to understand what they meant to me. Days after the Manchester attack, I was teaching a jazz routine to local elementary school children in a downtown community. I caught glimpses of one girl, Seetha, in the back corner with her head down and hands folded in her lap. The more I attempted to approach her, the more she closed off. I finally reached her, placing my hand on her shoulder, and a small tear streamed down her cheek. This third grade child, torn from her idyllic perception of the world, now felt personally condemned by her classmates for an attack with motives that she couldn't begin to comprehend. 'Why do they treat me this way?' she murmured under her breath. At that moment, I didn't know what to do or say, but I stayed with Seetha, my hand still resting on her shoulder. The other children began noticing Seetha's pain and saved me from my embarrassment; I took a step back, watching them surround her with positive words and tight hugs. I played a lyrical song as they began to dance freely rather than perform technical steps. Her tears dissipated and genuine laughter emerged -- dance had temporarily freed her from these burdens. It didn't matter that she barely knew the others; dance made her feel connected and wanted.As the children rallied together, I found dance's power as an equalizer, diminishing stereotypes and fostering cohesion among individuals from a multitude of backgrounds. This was my first introduction to a deeper comprehension of artivism; Seetha was my first step to empathy. The weighty landings of the grande jetes, the tense upper body in the d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s, were now real. I understood what that weight meant, I saw the fear evoked. The arts are a powerful way of addressing complex societal issues, and my growing understanding that art is just as potent as words assures me that I can be an effective activist through dance.While I was reading to the children in the local elementary school, introducing them to new characters and unknown realms, they gathered as close as possible, their bright eyes exuding an insatiable and genuine curiosity, their faces glued to the vibrant illustrations. I caught the gentle smile of Ms. Vicario, the OC Educational Arts Academy's volunteer coordinator, who was sitting in the furthest corner of the cafeteria, and immediately felt belonging. Walking distance from my school, this elementary school was my home on Friday afternoons.At OCSA, I found a niche in the mentors and the advocates who incited my passion for hands-on civic engagement. It was listening to Ms. Vicario read imaginative, student written stories inspired by the books read to them, that gave me joy. It was working alongside Jim Kolb, the director of my dance conservatory, who persistently scooped gelato while firmly gripping a crutch in his other hand, fundraising to support the arts education I greatly cherish, that inspired me to become an active member of society.I vowed to give these elementary school kids everything that I had received from my mentors. The same students that were previously in my Camp OCSA arts enrichment classes, first learning beginner pirouettes and battements, were now maximizing their opportunities at this school, innovating and creating their own stories. Giving these children the chance to succeed not only brings me immense satisfaction, but it also enables me the privilege of continuing this tradition of mentorship that OCSA has fostered. I cherished the mentors who sacrificed to provide me with ample opportunities, and I hoped to be that mentor for the next generation of artists and storytellers. As the number of Friday afternoons began to accumulate, I felt belonging with these students, and I had this responsibility to represent their needs. Whether it be through reading stories, teaching dance classes, or leading team-building exercises, my own actions were directly benefitting these students. The privilege of watching these students better themselves as artists, students, and people has motivated me to become an active influencer. Inefficiencies and wasted time are inherent in almost all systems that we encounter. This past summer, I interned at the Veterans Affairs Hospital and discovered that these inefficient systems not only refer to mechanical processes, but also human actions and everyday life. From the first day I began the internship, all the interns collectively met in a conference group as we began to discuss possible strategies to reduce some of the inefficiencies present in the radiology department. At the conclusion of the orientation, my boss informed me that I would be working independently and under the mentorship of this college student, who would serve as needed assistance rather than constant guidance. Needless to say, I was terrified and overwhelmed as I had always received direct instruction and requirements when completing projects and assignments in the past.At this hospital, I worked under the System Redesign team, which was dedicated to observing and analyzing systems throughout the different health departments and clinics in order to improve efficiencies; I worked to physically install kiosks in the Primary Care Department to facilitate patient check in and added mirrors in Radiology to speed up appointment scheduling. However, beyond the hospital internship, hidden inefficiencies within my own life became glaringly obvious. I learned to break down some of the most mundane activities in my life and apply these principles of efficiency. It began with packing my backpack and dance bag the night before to ensure that I could sleep in the next morning and get ready for school faster. It then continued to moving my phone and schoolwork on opposite sides of the room to prevent distractions. Between schoolwork and extracurricular activities, a lack of time had always been a burden. Once I began looking at some of these simple tasks and processes as systems plagued with inefficiencies, I was able to locate the places in which productivity could be increased. While these initial applications of the principles were fairly self centered, I wanted to see how these principles would translate in some of my community service activities.Specifically when volunteering as a dance instructor for the unprivileged children in the local community, I wanted to maximize the two hours a week that I was given to expose these kids to dance, which was an opportunity that they were very rarely given. Instead of futile efforts to begin class by quieting down individual students, observing the dance class as a system helped identify more efficient and effective manner of achieving the desired result. To reduce the time it took to get all the students' attention every week, I would have the kids all gather and sit down in a large circle at the beginning of every class. Once they left their shoes right beside the door and walked into the classroom, they would be told to immediately gather together, which also helped the camp counselors quiet down the students and begin teaching in a more efficient manner. While observing people and situations as systems is far from natural, this way of thinking helped humanize some of the technical jargon utilized by the healthcare administrators in System Redesign. This internship at the Veterans Affairs Hospital allowed me to examine and evaluate multiple aspects of my life, allowing me to understand why and how certain actions lead to desired outcomes.Portraits never cease to intrigue me. Beyond the individual brushstrokes comprising the subject's face, I find the emotion behind the frozen image of an individual, trapped by the frame, to be more compelling. As I walked by the portraits in San Francisco's Legion of Honor, I stared at each meticulously painted pairs of eyes as my brain began to process the visual stimulus.In art history, there lies an interplay between intuition and intentionality. My world was one of instinct; when choosing board members for Key Club, I had already decided based on the charisma and demeanor of each candidate walking through the door. But art requires a methodical approach to observation resembling a scientific procedure in a clinical study. I learned to deconstruct artwork into its constituents: color, symbolism, materials, texture, subject, style. A single light source, a subtle rendition of chiaroscuro that Da Vinci would soon perfect in fifty years, cast a shadow on the subjects' faces. The triangular composition created by the two people and the dog was emphasized through a contrast between dark and light. The figures were elongated and lacked human rationality, characteristic of the Italian Renaissance. The portrait was filled with symbols: a dog to represent fidelity, the convex mirrors with tiny scenes from the Passion of Christ to represent the eye of God. It was after this deconstruction that Van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait began to transform. Art history ignited an understanding of artworks that had previously been impossible to interpret. The subjects were no longer stagnant or two-dimensional; the couple was in a sacred and matrimonious relationship filled with fidelity, observed by divine authority.However, there were unique instances in which deconstruction and intuition conflicted. Within seconds, art historians identified the Getty's Anavysos Kouros as a fraud while months of scientific inquiry deemed it ancient treasure. After years of mastery, art historians possessed this ability to decipher art pieces with solely instinct. To me, art had been instinctual; movement was best improvised and intuition dominated conversation, but intriguingly, approaching organic human expression in a mechanical manner proved to be successful. After the Manchester attack, as I was teaching a jazz routine to local elementary school children in the downtown community, I caught glimpses of one of the children, Seetha, in the back corner with her head down and hands folded in her lap. The more I attempted to approach her, the more she closed herself off. Once I finally reached her, placing my hand on her shoulder, a small tear made its way down her cheek.This third grade child, who had lived in such an idyllic version of the world, void of judgement, now felt personally condemned for an attack with motives that she couldn't even begin to comprehend. These words, just simply strung together, created a myriad of connotations and represented stereotypes that manifested themselves in her unconscious. 'Why do they treat me this way?' she murmured under her breath.At that moment, I didn't know what to do or what to say, and that hurt the most. As I stayed with Seetha, my hand still resting on her shoulder, the other children began noticing Seetha's pain, and saved me from my embarrassment. I took a step back, watching them surround her with nothing but positive words and tight hugs. I played a lyrical song as the kids began to dance freely, rather than perform specific technical steps. Her tears dissipated and genuine laughter emerged, as dance had temporarily freed her from these burdens. It didn't matter that she was in a room with other kids that she barely knew; dance made her feel connected and wanted.As the children rallied together, a visual cacophony of flailing limbs and emotions, I found dance's power as an equalizer, diminishing stereotypes and fostering cohesion among individuals of a multitude of backgrounds. It was this dance program, introducing the arts into the lives of children, that allowed them to forget that they didn't have the expensive dance shoes that other may have and escape the factions that lead to discrimination. Now, they radiated confidence and joy as they found this microcosm of society in which diversity holds the most power.",,,
50,Admitsee,3.5,1,2,,,,,"Physically, besides our Chinese complexion, there's one characteristic that has defined the Wei family: hair. Lots of it.I tie my bushy ponytail with two actual rubber bands, because normal hair-ties keep breaking\u2014and still, it whacks my face when playing tennis. My brother never wears shorts on first dates, to hide his hairy legs. And since I was young, I've loved ruffling my mom's abundant hair.That changed my junior year, when my mom came home with her hair shaved off.I could barely recognize her. It was in that moment that the reality of her breast cancer hit me. I felt compelled to do anything to help her. To be strong for her. I held her close and somehow I knew we were going to be okay.Her cancer made me step up as a daughter. I did things for her out of love that I would have never done for myself. When her joints ached, I scoured the internet to find comfortable shoes for her. When she needed exercise but was too tired, I did leg lifts with her in bed.After a few cycles of chemo, my mom's blood counts were low. When she smelled her once-favorite foods, she wanted to throw up. But I knew she needed her nutrition. I asked the school's cooking teacher for recommendations. She gave me a whole cookbook of just soups, and I experimented at home with new flavors, ranging from minestrone to broccoli-cheddar, unusual to our Chinese cuisine. Mom's next blood test results showed her counts increased. I quit the tennis team to care for my mom. Tennis had been my first identity in high school. It shaped my work ethic and taught me resilience in the face of hard losses. But during tennis season, when my mom went through her toughest chemotherapy sessions, I knew I had to be there for her. In a way, tennis was an artificial environment to practice for the real challenges of life. I saw more powerful ways to use what the sport had taught me. My mom needed me more than my team did, and I needed more time with her.Mom's cancer taught me that each moment was important. I'll remember planting kisses on my mom's face as I tucked her into bed. I'll remember cleaning up her vomit with my dad in the small bathroom, working together with gloved hands. I'll remember telling a classmate about my mom's cancer, and her response: 'I haven't told anyone. I have leukemia. Now I realize I'm not alone.' Through laughter and conversations about family struggles, hospital visits, and favorite songs, we made a deep connection. I realized that there were important moments not just with family, but also with the people around me. I wanted to appreciate them all.As a journalist, I hoped to make moments important for others too. Where the boys basketball team saw their usual post-game meeting in the locker room, I saw a story of how a team became a family. Where a math teacher didn't think twice about his doodling, I saw a hidden talent worth featuring. I found so much inspiration in learning about what made people uniquely themselves: their stories, ideas, opinions. I wanted to capture those unique stories of my school, for people to feel important and heard. I found my new identity, a student journalist: a listener who sees the world with curiosity, compassion and purpose\u2014someone who helps empower others.This summer, I donated 9 inches of my ponytail. I imagine the strands bringing confidence to someone I'll never know. As I helped my mom pick out a wig to wear when returning to work, I saw small hairs beginning to grow. I saw resilience.As our hair grows, I will too. Smiling through challenges and learning from them. Appreciating the people around me. Making every moment important.When I saw the iconic photo of Alan Kurdi washed ashore, I cried. After class, I stayed behind with my friend Meghana, trying to grasp the complexities of the Syrian Refugee Crisis, wishing we could do something. Online, Meghana and I discovered Paper Airplanes: a non-profit that connects students with Syrian refugees to tutor. We established Lynbrook's chapter, inviting students to join through social media. Twenty committed to help.Through Paper Airplanes, I tutored a 17-year-old Syrian refugee living in Turkey, who wanted to take the TOEFL to attend college. Helping him grow from incomplete English sentences to his first essay filled me with pride. I wanted to be the best tutor possible for him, and I saw the other twenty tutors feel the same about their own students. But many were intimidated to teach English learners for the first time.I set out to help, reading education blogs and drawing from my experiences to create tutoring-workshops such as 'Spicing up Grammar Lessons' and 'Fun Writing Activities.' I also led discussions where we devised ways to improve lessons and empower our students. For example, Zahra's student spoke Arabic during lessons because she was afraid to make mistakes in English. Together, we discussed how to create a safe space so students felt comfortable.Initially, some tutors didn't quite understand the realities of the Syrian Refugee Crisis. When some students couldn't be reached due to their unstable lives, I encouraged them to use it as a learning opportunity to understand what being a refugee meant. This year, we've expanded our leadership team and number of tutors and plan to spread more awareness about refugee and immigrant rights through speaker events. It has been so fulfilling to see the growth in our tutors: not only have they gained confidence in their leadership abilities, but they've also formed lasting friendships with their students and personal connections to this global issue.The Syrian Refugee Crisis remains a daunting issue to solve, but I believe through education and empathy, we can make a meaningful difference and make the world feel more connected.My junior year, creative problem solving took on a new meaning for me when my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. To help with the challenges arising from her chemotherapy, I found solutions with creativity and love.Chemotherapy killed my mom's taste buds, and her once-favorite foods became difficult to swallow. I knew she needed her nutrition; I thought, if she were to try foods that she hasn't eaten before, she would have no prior expectation of their flavor, so she wouldn't be as disappointed. Every night, I would cook her different foods from different cuisines. I was ecstatic when she enjoyed them a lot more.However, another problem arose. A few hours after eating her meals, she would become nauseous and vomit her food, undigested. Her doctor told her this was normal. I knew vomiting was a side effect of chemotherapy, but I refused to accept that there was nothing I could do about it. Exercising, I thought, could be a possible solution. If she moved around, I thought, it could help my mom's body actively digest food. I knew this wouldn't solve the entire problem, but I hoped it would make a difference. So, I'd go on walks with my mom to encourage her to move around, and bought her new, comfortable shoes when her feet were swollen. As she had more chemo treatments, she became too tired to get out of bed. I created a workout for her to do in bed, consisting of leg lifts, crunches (with me holding down her legs), and arm circles \u2014 all done without standing up. The exercise did help my mom's digestion. It also helped her in ways I didn't imagine: going on walks helped her calm her mind, and exercising together in bed gave us another way to bond together. An act of creativity not only brought a solution to a problem, but it also created happy memories. In taking care of my mom, I've learned to use creative problem solving to help others, and to face challenges with positivity and resilience.I'm fascinated by the interdisciplinary potential of computer science. Beyond data structures and algorithms, it's about solving problems creatively.When I entered high school, I started teaching myself through MIT's OpenCourseWare, working my way through problem sets with Python. In sophomore year, I took C++ courses at Foothill College. In addition to teaching me about object-oriented programming and pointers, my professor introduced me to the 3 P's: Patience, Practice, and Perseverance. Today, I strive to use the 3 P's in everything I do.My junior year, I realized technology could positively impact the way our school newspaper told stories, making them more compelling and accessible. As a student journalist, I saw that our community was filled with powerful stories that couldn't fit in a monthly paper. So, I decided to build a website to put our stories online. The website increased our viewership, allowing parents and alumni to engage with our stories. When several staffers wrote online stories relating to the #MeToo movement, I compiled the stories together and coded our publication's first multimedia package. It was an unique way our audience could experience a story, and I want to continue combining code and journalism to present powerful stories: from analyzing data for investigative stories to creating multimedia projects. When my mom's breast cancer was diagnosed after she experienced symptoms, I wondered whether a machine-learning-based model could have detected her cancer during an annual mammogram months earlier, instead. I immersed myself in neural networks, activation and loss functions, weights and biases, pulling together Python libraries to create a model that can recognize breast cancer in mammograms. I was so excited when, uploading my mom's mammogram to the model, I watched it circle her cancer's location in red. I hope to continue this research in other fields, finding meaning of the world's piles of data.Computer science is more than an academic subject: it's a way to search for new solutions, to expand possibilities. I want to study both computer science and the humanities to tell compelling stories as a journalist and better solve problems that impact the people around me.As a student journalist, I've learned that every person has a meaningful story to tell. Sharing and listening to stories can make us more open-minded, compassionate, and understanding of the people and the world around us. I seek out the stories of others, listening and sharing them with compassion.Stories bring awareness and create tangible change. My co-editor and I filmed a documentary on the wave of youth activism following the Parkland shooting to capture this movement for our community; at our first screening, we distributed voter-registration forms. When I collected data on students' experiences with bullying for a feature, the principal shared it at an all-staff meeting about school culture. I wrote an editorial that brought attention to the school's lack of emergency preparedness; the following school year, administrators conducted a Run, Hide, Defend drill. I interviewed a student at our school, who showed me how one person's courage to speak out can spark a movement. He told me about his loneliness and depression, which led to drug use and an intentional overdose his senior year. He wanted others to hear his story: to break the stigma around mental health in our community, to help others realize they're not alone, to spread hope and positivity. I spent countless hours writing the story, knowing I had to do it justice. I hoped it could inspire others the same way it inspired me. The story created a ripple effect. Our newspaper's online traffic tripled, surpassing 1,200 views for the first time. At our school, mental health issues are apparent, but rarely talked about. The story led to students having more open conversations about mental health. A teacher said it reminded him of why he became a teacher. A parent translated the article into Chinese and shared it in a group-chat with hundreds of parents, where they discussed how to address mental health with their own children.Stories acknowledge the voices of individuals, bringing the community together. I want to use journalism to make people feel heard, to empower others to share their voices and to inspire positive change.Although I joined the school newspaper on a whim and had previously planned to take AP Computer Science, journalism has become a core part of the person I am today. To me, journalism is a way to see the world with curiosity and compassion. Everyone has a story, and journalism allows me to hear those stories \u2014 to learn more about the people around me and be inspired by them. Journalism tells people, 'Your story matters,' and I want to be someone who helps the community by showing people that their voices are important. I also love the fast-paced nature of journalism, how it pushes me to tap into abilities I never knew I had, like produce a high-quality story on a tight deadline.Journalism has taught me to experience the world with an open mind, to soak every moment in \u2014 because wherever you go, there's an exciting story.It's Tuesday lunch. My club officers and I begin with a presentation about spicing up grammar lessons for English learners. Then, the classroom lights up with discussion, each tutor sharing about their student. 'He's so motivated!' says Sanjana, describing her 17-year-old student who wants to fight for peace in Syria. Zahra poses a question; her student from Saudi Arabia speaks Arabic during lessons because she is afraid to make mistakes in English. 'What do you guys think I should do?'Together, our group come up with ways to help her student feel more comfortable during the online tutoring sessions.Two years ago, near the end of my sophomore year, this community of 30 people was only 3: my history teacher, my classmate, and me. Our world history teacher opened my eyes to the Syrian Refugee Crisis and the political, economic, and social factors that made it so difficult to solve. My classmate and I would stay in her classroom after school just talking about it, wishing there was something we could do.Then, I learned about Paper Airplanes \u2014 an organization that connects English-speaking students with same-aged Syrian refugees to tutor. I told my friend about it, and last year we implemented it at Lynbrook. Through tutoring, we've learned to become better communicators and realized that, despite our students' varied life experiences, we're still the same: teenagers with big dreams who just want to have fun.When I see a new club member begin tutoring, I'm filled with hope and excitement for them, eager to help them learn more about the world and make a new friend. This community shares a love for education, helping others, and immersing ourselves in world issues, trying to make a difference, instead of turning a blind eye to problems too difficult to solve.Why that College or School?Computer science isn't just writing code to create a project; it's a way of assessing problems and devising solutions for them. This way of thinking \u2014 of breaking large problems into smaller, manageable pieces that can be solved by teams of people, of constantly coming up with ways to improve \u2014 can be applied to so many fields, from medicine to education to journalism.At the University of Michigan, I hope to double major in computer science and communications to create systems that allow the stories we share to have a wider impact. Last year, I created a website for our school newspaper because I wanted to tell more stories than could fit in a monthly 16-page paper. I realized that technology can bring a story to life in exciting ways. From multimedia projects to data analysis and visualization, technology allows stories to leave an even larger impact on audiences and can be used to create lasting change. It empowers people to share their voices. That's what technology should be about: empowering others. I want to be someone who can use her technical skills to empower other people to share their stories and show them that their voices matter.I'm ecstatic that the University of Michigan provides such a thorough curriculum to explore these ideas. Courses such as EECS 554, Introduction to Digital Communication and Coding, would help me build platforms that innovate the way people share stories: allow them to reach more people and expand the potential of multimedia. COMM 495, Future of Digital Media, would connect me with peers who also aspire to bring communities together with technology and stories, and together we could come up with new ways to do so.Moreover, I hope to be part of The Michigan Daily staff to incorporate my love for computer science and journalism to share the stories of the people around me, through gathering data for investigative projects and using web and multimedia tools to immerse an audience into a story.I want to study at the University of Michigan because of how much the school embraces the idea of 'interdisciplinary.' I want to attend a school that embraces such a philosophy because computer science and communications are inherently interdisciplinary; computer science is applicable to so many fields and stories can be told about any subject and any person. I hope to minor, if not take classes in, urban studies and crime & justice to help me better understand the communities I want to serve after graduating. Taking classes as part of Michigan's data science major will give me the skills needed to pursue data journalism, a way to tell powerful stories with both numbers and words that can contribute to even more impactful investigative reporting.As a student, I hope to learn more about my community by immersing myself in it and giving back through programs such as the Prison Creative Arts Project.University of Michigan's focus on 'it's not just a major' and community outreach excites me because I will get to learn about the world in an interdisciplinary way and see the issues I care about through multiple perspectives.Idea or experience that makes you excited about learningI stared at Big Hero 6 on the screen, a substitute teacher's attempt to control a class of 8th graders. Fascinated by futuristic San Fransokyo, I fell in love with Baymax and the way he could help others\u2014with super strength and knowledge about every medical procedure. That day I knew I wanted to learn computer science: to push possibilities like Tadashi, Baymax's designer, to create something to help people in ways never before imagined.When my mom was diagnosed with cancer, I wondered whether machine learning could have detected her cancer during an annual mammogram, instead of months later, after she felt symptoms. I had to find an answer.I immersed myself in this new world of neural networks, activation and loss functions, weights, and biases. The articles at first felt like reading a foreign language, pushing me to further understand those concepts. I was thrilled, in that moment when all the calculus concepts I learned in class clicked together with the project, and I rushed to explain it to my mom and brother.After pulling together Python libraries and making my own model, I was ecstatic when I uploaded my mom's mammogram and saw it circle the location of her cancer in red.I want to apply this research to other fields such as education and journalism, using the potential of machine learning to find meaning in the piles of data in the world. The future is now. And I can be a part of creating it.Note to future roommateDear Roommate,To me, mornings and nights are special, and I'm so excited to share these times of the day with you! Mornings are filled with possibility\u2014a chance to build upon who you were yesterday\u2014and nights are a chance to reflect. Both are times to appreciate the present. I started morning runs this year. Will you join me? A friend created a workout for his sports science class, and one for me too. His random idea made me realize how awesome it feels to do at least one thing you're proud of every day. In my favorite Japanese drama Miss Pilot, two female pilot trainees go on runs in the morning, encouraging each other, and suddenly, the whole dorm joins. Could that be us?At night, do you want to share bedside books? I'll bring my copy of The Things They Carried, my favorite quotes highlighted in blue. What things do you carry? I carry the quirk of nodding a lot when I listen. I first noticed it watching myself on the school talk show. I do it because I'm listening to you! When I do, there's no one more important to me.From my childhood, I carry my stuffed panda and my excitement over the weirdest things, like airplanes. What gets you excited like a little kid?When two pilots meet before their flight, it's usually for the first time\u2014like us. We're the pilots for our college journey. I can't wait for the experiences we'll carry together.PatriciaSomething meaningful to you and why'I overdosed on purpose,' he* said, 'When I woke up in the hospital, I saw my mom crying next to me. I finally realized life is worth living.'I sat next to him, listening intently. In that moment, there was no one more important. HIs words reminded me that every person is a world in itself, wrapped in stories, experiences, and emotions, that, when shared with another person, gives them a new perspective. His world affirmed the importance of empathy and compassion. I was in awe of his courage and strength, grateful that I got to witness it.My duty now was to do his story justice. I owed it to him, who wanted it told. If the story could help one person, it would have been worth it.After I published his story, a ripple effect started. A teacher said he was reminded of why he became a teacher. A parent translated the story into Chinese; online, it sparked a conversation about mental health among hundreds of parents who often shied away from the topic.I'll forever carry his story with me. Today, the community carries his story, too. They carry his message to be kind and judge less\u2014to acknowledge the stories in the people around them. People's stories are meaningful because they stop you in your tracks, compelling you to step inside someone else's shoes and emerge more open-minded and compassionate. His showed me the power one story has to start a movement.",,,
51,Admitsee,3.5,1,,3,,,6,"Forced labor. Constant surveillance. Starvation camps. My 25-year-old dad decided to leave. He was disgusted by the idea of spending the rest of his life in the country in which he grew up, where neighbors betrayed each other to the secret police in hopes of gaining government favor and two million people died of hunger from the socialist economy's perpetual inability to produce food. My dad dreamt of coming to America; even the Iron Curtain could not prevent the spread of the peculiar news that the people in the United States were free. So, he disguised himself as a glass merchant (one of the few groups allowed to leave Romania, although only under strict surveillance) and jumped off a train in the Hungarian countryside with only the clothes he was wearing and about 100 dollars sewn into his shirt shoulder. The communists came for his parents a few days later. They jailed my grandpa; to this day, he does not speak of what they did to him. They never caught my dad. If they had, I would not exist.My dad is now a successful American physician. Although in my comfortable American life I am far removed from the daily hardships in communist Romania, hearing his story as a child ensured that I have always appreciated the variety of opportunities I am afforded simply because I live in the United States. His story has become integral to my identity and shaped the lens through which I view the world. I value my ability to receive an American education because it cost my family much more than money; it cost a gamble with death. I know that to compensate for the high price of my education, I must produce an immense return on the investment. Furthermore, learning the story of my dad's escape to the West taught me to prize the liberty ensured to Americans. I am privileged to live in a country whose government was instituted to protect liberty, rather than destroy it, and I am grateful for the unique cocktail of Enlightenment philosophies embodied in the free society for which my dad risked his life.Although I appreciate the privileges unique to this nation, being a child of immigrants guarantees I also value cultural diversity, especially because my personal identity is an odd blend of Romanian affability and American practicality. Having learned Romanian at home and English in kindergarten, I had always wanted to add to my repertoire a language that was a product of my own accomplishment and allowed me to communicate with people of a previously unapproachable culture. In middle school, I taught myself Spanish with textbooks, drilling myself on grammar rules for two hours a day until I was confident in my ability to converse fluently. That skill has allowed me to participate in a community to which I would otherwise have no exposure. I now teach Hispanic immigrants English and help them adjust to American society. As they piece together words into sentences and grow accustomed to guttural English R's, I see a reflection of my dad's similar attempts 25 years ago. As English begins to roll smoothly off the students' tongues, they are empowered to create new blends of their own principles, fusions of American values and their own traditions, like the one my dad passed on to me.My dad's illegal escape from communist Romania was perilous, but it has granted me access to new perspectives that have stretched my mind, redefined my culture, and motivated me to help others navigate their own immigration obstacles. The high price my dad paid for the lifestyle I was handed at birth is a testament to my privilege. I have been fortunate to reap the benefits of my dad's sacrifice for freedom.Describe an intellectual experience that has meant the most to you.Competing in math taught me how to think. I often tell people that if I had not participated in math competitions since the third grade, I would lack most of my current mental capabilities. Today, due to my high school's lack of an adequately funded and coached math team, I consider myself primarily a debater, but before high school, 'mathlete' was my identity. Competitive math gave me some of my best friends and most influential role models, as well as numerous trophies to display on my bookshelf. However, my most valuable acquisition was invisible, and one I did not appreciate until later: an ability to use logic to solve problems.Math competitions teach, but they don't give answers. They train you to deduce them yourself. Competitive success depends upon a profound understanding of how to manipulate mathematical concepts to produce solutions. You must decipher problems, separate distractions from relevant information, and invent tricks that fill in missing pieces of puzzles. You tackle tens of problems testing hundreds of different concepts whose linkages you race to exploit. In competition, math is not divided into geometry, algebra, trigonometry, and calculus. There is only logic, which can be applied to planes, variables, triangles, or curves. If you understand the logic of trigonometry, you can modify it at will and apply it to calculus. If you can't, you lose. Competitions train you to perceive the ways in which principles of mathematical reasoning connect numerous real-world situations. They teach you that 'thinking like a mathematician' means searching for deeper truths behind information to discover its broader implications.Competition math propelled my academic success by teaching skills that were conspicuously absent from my high school classes. Math classes in a large public high school prioritize efficiency over depth, sidelining critical thinking for speed. Rather than train me to devise my own solutions to problems, school math tells me to plug numbers into a memorized formula to produce an answer without ever questioning its logic. Why create new ways to solve problems when you can ace tests by following prescribed procedures? As a result, math classes, which should supposedly teach the logic and problem-solving skills crucial to every other academic discipline, instead leave students lacking the depth required to solve problems to which their memorized procedures do not apply.Had I not learned creativity and critical thinking from competition math, I would not have achieved much of my academic success. My debate skill relies on my ability to strategize and cleverly exploit opponents' logical errors. I learned Spanish grammar by envisioning nouns and verbs as components of an equation that fit together in a particular way to produce meaning. My chemistry and physics classes required little effort once I understood the logical behavior of molecules and waves; the formulas in my textbook were simply written representations of those rational conclusions and could be reinvented at will. The realization that my studies in every subject simply required different applications of the same mathematical problem-solving principles I had learned in the third grade empowered me to maximize my education.Competition math has changed the way I learn. It has succeeded where school has often failed: in teaching me to seek deeper connections behind concepts and pursue knowledge beyond the realm of mechanical fact memorization. Competitions revealed to me that although 'critical thinking' is a common catchphrase on the lips of politicians who claim to improve schooling, it is meaningless absent an educational system that prioritizes depth, logic, and inquiry. To be authentic, learning cannot be superficial. Blindly following a script does not require thought or promote intellectual growth. Instead, competition math empowered me to write the script myself.",,,
52,Admitsee,,,,,,,,,,,
53,Admitsee,4,1,2,3,,5,,"As a child, I was irrationally afraid of mushrooms, particularly sliced ones. The intimidating slices always had a curved top attached to a rectangular stalk. To me, these pieces resembled faces, staring out at me from their two curved-top eyes. The worst offenders resided on pizzas, poisoning the melted layers of cheese atop my favorite dish. I believed that they were always staring at me, judging my every move, despite their inanimate nature. Nobody understood the anxiety provoked by this harmless fungus, but personally, I could not get over the fact that the mushroom's 'eyes' were watching me.My childhood fear of the judgment that mushrooms' eyes held became a fear of eye contact during my childhood. I was anxious that others were critiquing me with every glance. My reserved nature stemmed from this fright, and the thought of speaking in front of people was enough to make sweat perspire on my forehead. But I no longer wanted to be characterized by my fear, nor did I want it to prevent me from communicating with others. One day, in sixth-grade, I reached towards my face and removed my glasses, turning the world into an abstract portrait.My 20\/200 vision was no longer a weakness but rather a strength. When I spoke, I did not fear eye contact, as others' eyes resembled circles\u2014empty of emotion and detail. This impairment allowed me to overcome my fear of communication, and I readily embraced my new persona. When my name was called, I could confidently rise up and express my opinion without worrying about my classmates' piercing stares. I was not afraid to be the person who cuts the awkward silence in a room. It was this newfound discovery that sparked my love for public speaking and fostered my passion for Speech and Debate. Something I previously dreaded became something that I voluntarily adored.During my presentations, I forced myself to understand that the clumps of color before me were people. This cognitive dissonance often confused me; I was uncertain about whether I was staring at everyone's eyes. Nevertheless, my pupils surveyed the room and rested upon different audience members when needed. My eyes could have been gazing at the audience's foreheads, but the feedback praising my 'strong eye contact' assured me otherwise.Through time, my strategy began to weaken. I could hardly make out the words my teachers wrote and became reliant on squinting to catch a glimpse of the world. Students and teachers alike joked about my squinting, urging that I wear the glasses I owned. Still, my hands could never reach for the frames. I was not fully aware that with every glance I dodged, I lost the opportunity to connect and see. It was not enough to listen. To truly hear someone I had to be able to see their perspective, and likewise, see them.Whether I was performing as Cesar Chavez, with my iconic S\u00ed Se Puede sign, at a history competition, or giving a biology presentation on Joseph Lister, I felt distant. So, halfway through junior year, I did the unthinkable: I put my glasses back on. The fear of the world that was previously instilled in me dissipated as those around me encouraged and supported me. Although I still prefer my pizzas plain, my life is now anything but.I can finally get to know who people really are, beyond the blurred faces to which I was accustomed. Facial expressions convey what words cannot and often show the true feelings someone is harboring. I plan to pay attention to these hints of insight and to proactively strive to be the person others feel comfortable around. I know what it feels like to shelter myself, and I want to help those around me reach past what secludes them. Looking at the world through my plastic lenses, I now feel invincible, and no stare can take that away.",,,
54,Admitsee,4,1,2,3,,5,,"I have never considered the question: 'Is it because I am Black?' because it often sounds like a convenient way to redirect a personal shortcoming to someone else; however, I couldn't help but wonder as I stood in the dance studio, at the ballet barre, surrounded by all of those assigned to my beginners-level ballet class, 'Is it because we are all Black?' I observed the patterns, noticing that the majority of the Caucasian dancers got the parts in the dance pieces, the skinnier girls were lauded during ballet class, and performance opportunities were awarded to those who had internal connections. It seemed that the talent aspect of the dance art form came secondary to unrelated factors of race, body shape, and connections. This left little opportunity for minorities like myself to advance in the dance world; however, I was determined to wake up the world around me, starting at my school, Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. Reflecting on the issues I found to be most prevalent in the dance world and my environment, I decided to explore the underrepresentation in ballet, the implicit bias, and the double standard. I chose choreography as an outlet for my concerns, addressing these issues in a way that allowed audience members to gain a new perspective on the issues without feeling as though they were being reprimanded or forced to conform to a different point of view. Initiating a conversation through choreography proved to be a logical first step in solving the problem of perspective.To bring awareness to the inherent discrimination that exists within the dance world, I created my own initiative entitled 'Turning Tables', which is an annual dance performance that features choreography from myself as well as many of my peers at my school. Each piece is crafted with hopes of highlighting the overlooked social issues in dance. The dancers represent a variety of dance levels, cultural identities, body types, and socioeconomic backgrounds - all emphasizing the themes of inclusivity and equality. The outcome of the initial presentation of Turning Tables was a captivated audience that expressed their satisfaction in having their artistic senses engaged and their perspectives broadened. Since it's inception, Turning Tables has extended its mission to offer underrepresented groups dance programs through the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Dallas. It is important to introduce young people to dance, in the hope that they will begin to consider dance as a viable career option that should not be inhibited by one's own connections, background, or race. I never would have imagined that my concerns would become my platform; however, some may say that my platform is nothing more than a 'race card'. That may be the perspective of some, and it's definitely easier for some to assume such a posture that to examine the position. To the contrary, Turning Tables encompasses my vision, and I've spent countless My dad slammed the English-Spanish dictionary down on the table, ripped open a fresh pack of crisp white index cards, handed me a ballpoint pen and told me to copy down every word in the dictionary. This is how my dad insisted that I was to learn how to read. I was only five years old, but I knew that there must be another way to learn how to read that did not involve me rewriting the entire dictionary. I felt like it would have made more sense to skip these unnecessary steps and just open a book. I remember my dad making me stay in the Junior Performing Dance Ensemble two years in a row to make sure that I had achieved complete mastery before attempting to move up to the next level. I felt like it would have made more sense for me to move up with my friends after just one year. My dad always made sure that I started at the beginning of the number line and wore double zero on my soccer jersey despite me wanting to skip straight to the number one. He even made me research queen Cleopatra before I could be her for Halloween. My dad claims he knows everything about golf. I remember him taking my sisters and me out to the country club ranges and teaching us the steps of the game. Step one: 'get your grip.' I assumed his goal in starting with getting a strong grip on the golf club was to establish a strong foundational base that would make hitting the ball easier. My environment has changed many times, from struggling to make friends at a new predominantly caucasian Catholic school to being fearful of the six weeks I was to spend by myself in New York City for the Alvin Ailey Summer Dance Intensive. However, in the face of these environmental challenges, I have always relied on slowing down and following the sequential steps that allow me to regain control of the situation, re-establish a strong base, and get my grip. In light of challenges, I am prepared to move forward.I have had many experiences that have shaped me as a person but having a strong foundational base has been the most substantial. I believe that my dad instilled this mindset in me in order to emphasize the unpredictability of life and the importance of facing life with purpose. Because of this, I realize the importance of having a strong foundation in everything I do. I am able to approach life confident and prepared, knowing that I am well equipped for all new situations and environments.",,,
55,Admitsee,4,1,2,,,5,,"Call 911! Jack is choking!' my mother screamed. I was five years old when my family thought my toddler brother was choking on a pretzel. In fact, Jack was having a grand mal seizure. His subsequent diagnosis of autism led to my fascination with the brain and a desire to understand how each neuron connection determines our lives \u2013 both our challenges and our triumphs. As a child, I was amazed by my parents' explanation of how our family could help 're-wire' Jack's brain by prompting new neuron pathways. Part of that process involved turning our house into a child's dream with all the downstairs furniture being replaced by ball pits, parachute swings, and a trampoline. Combined physical and verbal games, like singing 'pop pop the Jack popcorn!' while bouncing on the trampoline, became part of my everyday routine with Jack.When I was ten and Jack six, we went to see 'The Lion King' on Broadway. Before the show even started, my family was asked to leave because Jack's humming noise disturbed others. His tantrum of confusion outside the show left me shaken but determined to find \u2013 or create \u2013 a place where Jack and others like him would feel welcome with their families.As Jack was nearing middle school, I saw his connections to friends disappearing. He had previously thrived socially because at five years-old, he did not need fully developed language to laugh and play; however, by ten years old, Jack's circle of friends became the stuffed animals he carried in his backpack. The childhood friends were nice to him but moved on when they found Jack could not hold a conversation.Entering high school, I became more concerned about Jack's lack of friends and the absence of public places where he felt comfortable. Inspired by the mental image of Jack happily swimming across the pool at my family's summer day camp for hours, surrounded by campers, I created My Swim Friends - a free program for children aged 3 to 21 with special needs. They arrive at the camp with their entire family in the summer, eager to make friends: the special needs and their siblings each have a one-on-one buddy. Everyone enjoys a party-style buffet as lunch because each Sunday is truly a party celebrating each child. The parents surprise even themselves when they close their eyes relaxing poolside, knowing their children are well-cared for and can act without fear of being asked to leave. Through the inclusion of the entire family, the siblings realize that having a brother or sister with special needs is a blessing \u2013 something I understood early on. I designed a website, created a Facebook page, recruited my friends and teachers as volunteers, and obtained business sponsors, including Wegmans and the Manalapan Police Department. Seeing the success of My Swim Friends, I extended the program into the fall, calling it 'My Sports Friends' and replacing swimming with fall activities. During both seasons, Jack puts down his backpack of friends and engages with a fun-loving group of children with special needs, their neuro-typical siblings, and volunteer buddies. My Swim Friends is a 501\u00a9(3) nonprofit organization that has already grown from 20 to 120 children and will continue even while I am away at college.My motivation to pursue an education in biomedical engineering with a focus on neuroscience comes from my extraordinary experiences living with Jack. One of his therapists had said to me, 'When you walk in the room, Jack should say to himself, \\\u2018My life just got better'.' Through My Swim Friends, I have been able to make 12 Sundays a year better for all the children (and their parents) in the program. My aspiration is to use science and technology to help all individuals affected by neurological challenges live more functional, happier lives.",,,
56,Admitsee,3,1,,,,,6,"Most afternoons during elementary school, I could be caught perusing my grandpa's National Geographic collection, while my mom was at work. Neither the aroma of my grandma's food nor her scolding me to eat could keep me away from the pages of those magazines. Only after many minutes would I get up to enjoy the food she had made. Soon after, I would rush back to explore the photographs, traveling the world.Realizing my interest in photography, my grandpa gave me my first camera when I was eight: a simple Canon point-and-shoot. No other toy would exhilarate my mind as much as the small machine that takes in light to form an image. I spent hours taking pictures of grandpa's flowers in his miniature garden. When I felt adventurous, I might walk to the neighborhood park in search of squirrels to photograph. But I desired more. Like the photographers from the National Geographic magazines, I wanted to go underwater to take pictures of whales, to witness the stunning northern lights, to observe Inuit hunters fishing on the ice. Most of all, I wished to bring back photographs to share what I find on my adventures.Although I have not reached my goal of traveling the world just yet, I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to visit many beautiful places. I have seen voodoo shops in New Orleans, children walking to class barefoot in rural Vietnam, the hustle and bustle of New York City, and the hurricane-stricken U.S. Virgin Islands. I spoke with a local woman on the island of St. Croix in the summer of 2018 as she offered to guide me to the market. She described how Hurricanes Irma and Maria had torn through the island, destroying what was in their paths. She lost her home, her children lost their school, and the island lost its hospital. After this short ten minute conversation, I quickly began to feel more connected to the place I was visiting. I had seen the hurricane damage from walking around the island and photographing it, but the woman's story was what I needed to understand. With this knowledge, I felt more comfortable sharing the perspectives of the people who survived the hurricanes and was able to mirror these perspectives in my editing and composition, thus accurately portraying the emotion behind the photographs.As much as I am consumed by wanderlust, photography has become a significant part of my life here at home. I discovered portrait photography in freshman year and started to photograph my friends. Locals took notice of my work from my Instagram posts and began to ask for photoshoots. My best friend suggested that I could earn money from my photography, so with some marketing through social media, I built a business. People from all over San Jose began hiring me for prom, graduation, birthday, and fitness shoots. Because of photography, I am motivated to further explore my community in search of new photoshoot locations. I used to think San Jose and the surrounding area were boring places. However, collaborating with other photographers and utilizing overly familiar places as photoshoot locations have helped me gain different perspectives on the world around me, making home quite fascinating after all.From working with a camera, I jump-started my small business while advancing my artistic skills. I have developed a profound interest in worlds other than my own, with an inclination to explore and comprehend their history and culture. I am more open-minded after meeting many people and learning about the different lives they lead. Ultimately, photography has paved the way for my discovery of new people, places, and lifestyles. I know I will continue to have my camera in my hand, documenting my experiences and building connections with my environment, wherever life takes me.Every Sunday morning, I would see my fellow Venture Crew members joylessly walk into the meetings. I joined the crew because I saw a brochure for Venturing, depicting high adventures and young adults practicing leadership and technical skills. However, our meetings involved a flag ceremony and scouts scrolling through their phones until it was time to go home. I knew that I was not receiving the ideal experience from being in this scout crew, but rather than joining another crew, I made it my mission to transform this group.At the next meeting, instead of following the same agenda, I led everyone in a game that encouraged them to get to know each other. Then, I invited the crew to get lunch together. Each person was still quiet, but I started seeing smiles. I spoke to a couple of my other crew officers who also wanted to help, and we decided that a leadership training would be beneficial for the group. I assigned specific duties to my fellow officers and we prepared a two-day leadership workshop consisting of lessons that introduced the crew to time-management, communication, and team-building skills. For each week that followed, I continued to encourage participation by asking each scout for his or her opinion, by delegating tasks to each individual, and by doing cooperative work. We continued to have lunch together after almost every meeting. During our meetings and trainings, we built leadership and teamwork skills, but during lunch, we built friendships. Both of these aspects together made us a stronger crew.When it was time to get serious about planning a white-water rafting trip, everyone was pitching ideas on which river to go to, what to eat, and what other activities we wanted to do at the campsite. Each member volunteered for a task whether it was grocery shopping, contacting the campsite, or coordinating rides. I successfully brought my team together to achieve a common goal. As a leader, I motivated and inspired my crew to do their best to step up and be leaders themselves. As I walk through any tourist destination, I see cameras of all kinds, pointed in every angle imaginable. With just one click, we can retain a memory that may have otherwise lasted a millisecond. For me, photography is not just a way to capture memories. It is art.As with many beginning artists, I was sometimes discouraged. My skills were not developed and I worried that I did not have the right gear to be successful. I did not have enough money to buy more than the beginner camera kit from Costco. My pictures were more pixelated than other photographers'. They seemed to lack depth and the distortion was noticeable. However, I was determined to continue practicing.I realized that gathering raw images was only the first step. It is the moment I sit down, open my computer, and plug in my micro-SD card that my creativity jumpstarts. After correcting basic lighting and color, my pictures come to life in Photoshop where I can defy reality in a multitude of ways. Want a solar system with a human head as the central gravitational force? No problem. A reflection of yourself that is impossible according to the rules of science? Got it. I discovered how to make my projects unique. I posted them on Instagram and created my own website. Schoolmates started to take notice and requested photoshoots. As prom and graduation season approached, my friends suggested that I should start charging for my photography. Making money had not come to mind before, but I knew I somehow had to fund my photography. And people were willing to pay for my work. I marketed myself and acquired paying clients through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, eventually allowing me to upgrade my camera.From photography, I learned how to create digital art and run a small business. Not only did creativity come into play when crafting my photos, but also when publicizing my work. I did not let my financial drawbacks hinder my skill. Nor did I let my label as a 'beginner' define me as a photographer. I took all my struggles to my mom. Even though she was not fluent in English, she helped me work on poems for my third grade assignments. When I was too scared to ask for the bathroom key at McDonald's, I begged her to ask for me. If I did not understand the material in class, I asked my mom rather than the teacher. I was an extremely shy child, and she was my voice. I survived by relying on her. Not once did she encourage me to find solutions for myself. In 2012, she sat me down with tears in her eyes. She said three words that would change everything: 'I have cancer.'My mom did recover and return home after surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, but life was never the same. She no longer had a job, and I could see that she was ashamed of her financial instability.I realized that I could no longer be dependent on my mother. I started speaking up at school and in public. I had to take initiative and find resources to support not only myself academically but my sister as well. As soon as I turned 14, I took a job tutoring other students so that I could help my mother pay for groceries. I navigated my way through high school on my own. I advised my sister on her life and assisted her with homework. I learned to cook and prepare meals, relieving my mother's stress. Initially, I thought my situation was extremely unfair. Why was I spending so much time taking care of myself and doing tasks my peers had their parents do for them? There will never be an answer as to why I was placed in these circumstances, but I am grateful for the effect they had on me. Being self-sufficient and also a source of strength for my little sister taught me to be responsible and independent. I now face every challenge with confidence, knowing that I was able to overcome such a difficult one at a young age while demonstrating maturity and reliability. Kids, ages six to eleven, eagerly hold their robots, waiting for their turn to race. Six hours prior, none of them had ever touched a robot-making kit. They come from low-income families that do not have the finances to provide them with this experience. However, by the end of the day, they have learned how to build a robot and program simple commands for it. As Vice President of Programs of the non-profit, STEM in Motion, I am responsible for planning our frequent workshops. Proud of the work my team and I have done, I take a step back and admire the liveliness of the environment. However, one detail stands out to me. There is not a single girl in the room.Realizing this, I took the initiative to expand the program to a different group who may not be familiar with STEM topics: young women.As the only female on the STEM in Motion leadership team, I sometimes felt I did not belong. Even though women are starting to pursue careers in STEM, this area of study is still predominantly male. As a result, I met with my fellow leaders and spearheaded the organization of a workshop for girls. I designed flyers, promoted the event on social media, and spoke to young Girl Scouts about the opportunity. After 4 months of diligent planning, I hosted STEM in Motion's first 'Girls in STEM' workshop. That day, supported by my team, I excitedly introduced over 30 girls to robotics and computer programming. As we wrapped up the day, a girl approached me with enthusiasm, asking how soon she could return. Instilling this curiosity for a subject so foreign to the girls was my ultimate goal and I knew I had succeeded.As a young woman from a low-income family, I grew up ignorant about STEM, a subject I love and in which I am deeply immersed. I know I would have benefited from earlier exposure to STEM. Through STEM in Motion, I strive to open doors to future opportunities for youth who may be facing the same circumstances as I did.",,,
57,Admitsee,4,,,,,,6,"An arm bends inwards' -Korean proverbBones lay sprawled over my diagrams until my table is as much lab bench as it is artist desk. I raise a replica of a beaver pelvic girdle to the light and run a finger over the minute dips. With my drawing tablet, my other hand recreates the form as a 3D-model in Blender, a modeling software. I swipe over the tessellation of polygons with a 'crease' brush until dimples form along the structure. The pelvic ilia become wings. The ischia a bodice, lined by vertebrae. It's an anatomy class and a fashion design session. Leonardo Da Vinci spent a lifetime studying anatomy to create realistic art. To create surrealist art, with my own interpretations that sway others, I always start with careful examinations of scientific principles.After the mannequin's measurements are processed, a planar-cut tool divides the 3D-model into three pieces, printed separately: two ischia and one back-piece composed of two wings.I trace the mannequin's contours. Did I curve the ischia enough to fit over the breasts? Were the ilia stretched enough to actually look like wings when placed at the shoulder blades? Most importantly, are the pieces stable on the mannequin? Yes, yes, and no. Wire between the ischia and back-piece isn't sturdy enough; the asymmetrical ischia droop, wobble, and clack together. A rigid connector makes it impossible to place the structure over the mannequin.My fingers fly over the keyboard.Inflate. Crease. Repeat.Why is this combination so familiar?Oh. Yes. It was from my first 3D-model: my mother's face.Inflate. My mother's jaw is strong from a decade of chewing gum. During her first American job, she left home at 11PM and returned at 5PM--she chewed to stay awake. In middle school, I didn't wake up for myself; I cooked breakfast for my younger brother and walked with him to our school bus. It was the strength in my mother's jaw that I grew under, the memory I remember when attempting challenges.Crease. The white scar tissue above her lip spoke of a past where she cowered on the peeling bathroom floor, a quivering ball as my father struck her swollen belly and she cradled me from within. Her wrinkles are prominent when she holds the hand of my grandmother, who gazes back with dull, Alzheimer's-ruined-eyes. My mother taught me independence and how to keep responsibilities amidst relationships and divorce.Creating my mother's stricken expression immortalized in plastic, I was helpless. Emotions wrestled with fact and past. It's frozen, I thought. Too real.But I can still give my fashion design movement. I just need to surpass material constraints.That night, I watch my mother ladle soup into bowls. Her biceps strain to clutch the vessel and her forearm muscles bulge as she scrapes the bottom of the pot. Her muscles tighten like springs; but all elastics eventually recoil.My arms dart to catch the pot. Aha! As I bend my arms to keep it steady, I realize the key: elbows. Connecting the ischia to the back-piece requires a hinge for rotation along one axis, which would allow the pieces to be placed or removed easily from the mannequin. Like an elbow joint, my 3D-printed connector consists of two parts: one with a hollow cylindrical head and one with a solid cylindrical head that fits inside. Meanwhile, ball-and-socket joints anchored by annular ligaments between the wings allow them to move, creating fluidity and life. With flexion principles and fabrics, science and art, I can make the work both visually captivating and structurally sound.In the gallery, the bodice remains stable and the wings flutter with the breeze as viewers walk by. It even appears to rock with every double-take, every surprised exhale. It's organic, dynamic, a combination of forces. It's a balance-beam: science and art, fabric and technology. Stability and growth. With movement, flaws only add to the surrealism.",,,
58,Admitsee,4,1,,,,5,6,"The Joy of Life.As an eloquent narrative goes, the main character finds the love of his life to be inconspicuous. I have long determined that I would always cherish the joy of life in both pits and pinnacles of my story, but remained oblivious on how to obtain it\u2013urging myself the same question each morning, 'What can I do to attain genuine enjoyment in my story?'When researching for the HighScope MUN conference, articles of diversity greeted my arrival. Searching for credible guides was virtually an obstacle\u2013hindered by waves of unreliable MUN articles and prestigious yet expensive MUN courses. Exasperated, I spontaneously messaged three of my friends who were just as exhausted, 'Hey, why don't we create our own guide? Why don't we start a free platform for anyone in the world to learn about MUN?'With my freshly-introduced conceptualization, the philosophy of my innovative pursuit showered me with excitement. Though, the initial responses weren't all kudos with several friends opposing my concept and local companies rejecting my pitching proposals. Nonetheless, the rumbling winds of contradiction transitioned as momentum when I unintentionally captured myself 'procrastinating' 6-8 hours a day during winter break, constructing the fundamentals of my startup: teaching myself to build a website with captivating UI\/UX, teaching myself social media marketing strategies, reaching out to MUN ambassadors like Alexia Sideris, and producing numerous articles and videos\u2013essentially resources that everyone has equal access to. Hence, MUN for Everyone (M4E) was born.Exhilarated by the emerging response from our audience, I started to welcome our readers to collaborate with us as writer volunteers; the belief was that the most dependable MUN guide would come from delegates themselves\u2013from the community, for the community.Publishing our first article by our first volunteer, the next few hours were monopolized by the constant buzzing of my phone. What's this? Messages like 'I'm so proud of you!', 'Certainly makes me happy!', and 'Full of potential for great innings waiting!' were predominating the platform. But these warm praises were not meant for me, nor the platform. They were meant for Kandiah, the writer who wrote the extract. Kandiah's teachers and families filled the comments with wonderful admiration, expressing how they were absolutely proud of her accomplishment for publishing an article on M4E.Reading all these warm messages for my writer, I felt utterly at peace. Little did I know that such incident would internally generate this beautiful warm passion within my heart, giving me this unprecedented happiness that seemed to last not only in seconds. Seeing the elation Kandiah acquired and realizing how I gave her the podium to creatively share her knowledge to the community, it's utterly fulfilling to understand how\u2013for that brief period in the timeline\u2013I have engendered an impact to Kandiah's story\u2013and together, we've impacted our readers. To appreciate how my impact initiated Kandiah to disperse her impact to the M4E community, it sparks me how M4E was no longer only a platform for reliable MUN guides. It's honestly more\u2013a cross-collaboration network where like-minded delegates around the globe can come together and synergistically diverge our impact in educating those who don't have access to resources to discover international relations. This is our MUN for Everyone. This is the collaborative impact I love to initiate. This is the genuine warmth I love to create. This is social innovation. This is my passion.MUN for Everyone has altered my perception on happiness. I was constrained to answer my daily urge of self-euphoria, to now discover how the beauty of life flourishes within initiating euphoria to the stories of others. I learned how the resolution to my question may not even be an answer, but the right question\u2013because only then will I write the next chapter to my story. Now, I wake up to exhort a different question, 'What can I socially innovate to impact the stories of others?',because that\u2026is my joy of life.",,,
59,Admitsee,5,1,2,3,,,,"His glittered hand reaches for mine, and I swiftly yank my arm back to avoid contact. Hurt momentarily clouds his eyes, but his excitement soon returns once he rejoins the chaos of the parade. As the surrounding clamor of drag queens and rainbow motorcycles drifts into my periphery, a desperate isolation overcomes me. This march is my community's grandest welcome party\u2014the epitome of acceptance\u2014yet why do I feel like an excluded spectator? Shouldn't my rainbow flag also be fluttering in the air, not neatly furled beneath my jacket?My gnawing guilt feels all too familiar. It's what I first experienced when I spotted Jethro, then a freshman, in the school parking lot. While half of me basked in awe of his high heels and rainbow bandana, my other half suffered a creeping discomfort. Dad, expectedly, only expressed the latter.'Look, I know you're different too...but you're not that different right?''No, of course not.''Good.'As having just come out as gay, that fleeting conversation warped my self-perception. It solidified an arbitrary line between acceptable and detestable, leading me struggling to display idealized teenage masculinity. Instead of culinary documentaries, football. Gardening and watercolors became hobbies of history. I knew I succumbed to internalized homophobia, but conformity provided security. I preferred feeling confused and deprived to facing any negativity from expressing myself candidly.Thankfully, Jethro entered my life again\u2014this time on Instagram, where he passionately rebuked discriminatory comments. I attempted a facade of indifference, but subconsciously I resonated with his vulnerability and\u2014surprisingly\u2014courage. When he concluded with 'We have nothing to be sorry for,' I actually started to believe it.That millisecond of empowerment slowly became a feeling I craved. Thus, I ventured into the world of activism, but since my initial anxieties lingered, I remained anonymous. Through storytelling, I connected with others who confronted similar difficulties, writing and sharing blog posts about my social experiences. When my city back-lashed against California's new LGBTQ+-inclusive sexual education curriculum, I interviewed dozens of students on identity to compile their voices into a magazine, weaving together narratives of mental health, sexuality, and self-acceptance. Did it obliterate homophobia? No. But it certainly revealed perspectives that had been suppressed for too long. I was honestly proud of my project, yet I still obscured my name and story due to fear.The blare of horns drags me back to the present, and suddenly, I realize this march might be my final chance to escape hypocrisy and reclaim my activism. I urge others to live freely, but how can I do so when I shudder at the thought of being recognized with a rainbow flag?Here and now, I must accept that being gay does define me. Not as being predisposed to enjoy art and horticulture, but through my journey towards self-acceptance, I have gained a refined sensitivity to the struggles of others. I listen, I understand, and when others are lost, I extend my own experiences to empathize with their hardships. These qualities all contribute to my ability to tell compelling stories, a cornerstone of activism, but detached from their authors, stories are just hollow words. To truly empower others in the future, especially those in silence like I was, I can't shy away from the spotlight. I must let all my readers know that I am a tangible individual who is unashamed to exude my story truthfully.Before releasing my first real 'About Me' blog post, I unzip my jacket and reveal my flag. Uplifted by my thrill of starting a new chapter, my arm reaches higher into the canopy of confetti, and I stare wondrously at the colors rippling above. Finally, I feel no more doubt and no more fear: I break free from the sidelines and joyously clasp the next hand offered.",,,
60,Admitsee,4,,2,,,,,"As a child in Shanghai, I loved navigating the patternless paths of open-air markets with my grandmother, searching for bamboo shoots or daikon radishes. After moving to California, I missed the hustle and bustle of the markets, but rediscovered the same organic and animate nature of food in the community garden.Richly crinkled lettuces, jewel-toned lupines\u2026 In this vibrant and lush oasis, gardeners from all over my city craft verdant masterpieces in the freedom of their own 20x20 foot squares. On summer nights\u2014my favorite time to visit\u2014the mist from the hoses carried on the breeze mingles with the fragrance of the flowers and washes away the dust of the hot day.Every visit is a revelation. Many of the gardeners have been gardening for longer than I've been alive, and it's from them that I've learned the perfect mix of manure for growing the sweetest tomatoes and the best time to sow squash seeds. These tidbits of wisdom give me a more profound understanding of nature than any biology class: when the soil becomes miraculously fertile after growing legumes, I get to witness nitrogen fixation firsthand.Ultimately, what I enjoy most about the community garden is\u2026 the community. Although I spend so much time there, I don't actually have a plot. Rather, I walk the wood-chip paths, lending a hand here and there, transplanting seedlings and mulching rows. From planting monarch waystations to building raised garden beds for seniors, sharing my time has allowed me make friends with people from down the street and from across town, across generational and cultural divides. I snip zucchinis for the friendly mustachioed cooks at La Comida, the soup kitchen, while we trade recipes. The woman in the wheelchair watering tomatoes? I've become her dog sitter. The middle-aged man pulling weeds? We debate politics. On the surface, we may not share much in common, but in the garden's rich soil, I've established my own roots that allow me to tap into their complex and dynamic stories.The garden brought me closer to my community, but I never expected it to also bring me closer to home. I've realized that, at the unobservable pace at which plants grow, it takes patience and persistence to nurture a tiny seed into a plant. When my father was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, I had to call upon that resilience I had learned at the garden not only to care for him, but also to support the rest of my family on the long nights when my parents were at the hospital. I did everything I could: I cooked meals, looked after my brother, and even got a job when my dad lost his. But what meant the most to me was introducing him to my beloved garden. Every day after dinner, my father and I would walk there together. As we strolled the lavender-lined paths, I'd point out the new budding vegetables and we'd talk about all the golf courses he'd play when he gets better. For me, I was sharing the place I love: my source of strength, where I feel most grounded and connected to the humble brilliance of nature. For my father, the garden reconnected him to life outside the hospital, one of exercise, fresh air, and the sound of crickets on a warm summer night. The growing buds represented more encouragement for tomorrow than words could ever say.Through the seedlings I planted and fences I mended, I learned that community isn't just the borders on a map within which we live. It's an empathy that extends beyond merely understanding others or making small talk. As I go on to join new groups and communities, I will always make the effort to find common ground beneath surface similarities.",,,
61,Admitsee,4,1,2,,,5,,"I have tried to escape the truth, justify my actions, and run away from what I do. I am the bane of people's existence, a scapegoat for the world's collective anger. I am most people's arch-nemesis. I am incorrigible. I am ruthless. I am a cold-caller for a political campaign.While often reviled\u2013 there is a near universal hatred for solicitors\u2013 I believe the act of cold-calling is beautiful: a brilliantly choreographed performance which pairs quick thinking with resourcefulness, salesmanship with logic, and above all, persistence with even more persistence. While I would rarely label my phone calls as 'fun', through the thousands of calls I have made soliciting support, volunteers, and money for three political campaigns around Phoenix, I have learned three invaluable lessons which have been integral to my maturation.Lesson 1: be comfortable being uncomfortable. When I make a call, I have two options: regurgitate my cold and robotic script, or open up and try to connect with complete strangers in a few seconds. While the latter is far more successful, it is much harder because when I broadcast my passions, I simultaneously become vulnerable to personal rejection. However, to make a successful cold-call, I learned I must reveal the truest form of myself. I have used this lesson during my time as the president of my school's stock market club, where I have committed myself to go beyond simply teaching our members about the intricacies of stocks and markets. I hope to inspire them with my passion and positive attitude to love the topic as I do, and as a result, membership has almost doubled from previous years. My calls have proven that being vulnerable, while inherently uncomfortable, is essential.Lesson 2: seize the moment. When making calls, I am given ten seconds of attention before I am either tuned out or hung up on. I can either seize opportunities when they present themselves, or hesitate and fail. I am rarely afforded the luxury to dance around my goal, and as a result, I have learned to read a situation and take decisive action because if I stop to doubt my abilities, I will be pitching to a dial tone. This lesson proved valuable to me when my bosses at the Arizona Democratic Party asked me to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in front of thousands of people during the Phoenix 2016 Michelle Obama rally. Despite my abject terror at the prospect of speaking in front of that many people, my calls taught me to immediately accept their offer because I knew this opportunity would never come again. My calls have shown me I must be confident in myself and capitalize on opportunities if I want success.Lesson 3: perseverance is believing success is always just around the corner. In my cold-calling circles, we always had one saying which encapsulated our experience: 'It's always the next call.' I had been on streaks of dozens of hangups, refusals, or disconnected numbers, but no matter how bad the calls before had been, I remained motivated to make the extra call because I knew it only took one success to turn our fortunes around and potentially win the election. For some context, my first experience in politics was on the 2016 Clinton campaign, and my second campaign was on a state race, both of which ended in catastrophic failure. I could have easily quit, but my relentless salesmanship allowed me to join yet another campaign because I know my latest attempt would change everything.I won't pretend I valued my cold-calling as much then as I do retrospectively. Each refusal, mean-spirited remark, or hang-up stung\u2013 when you do something that often, it is hard to take failure as anything but personal. However, I am immensely proud I never hung up the metaphorical gloves and literal phone because each call helped me better define my work ethic.",,,

101,Admitsee,2.5,1,,,,,6,"You guys have helped me grow in more ways than you can imagine. I'll remember this day and each one of youforever. This is your win,' I say as I lift the trophy for the Best House. Tears run down my face, but I'm notembarrassed, not anymore, not in front of my house-mates.House captaincy wasn't my first student council position, nor has it been the most challenging leadership rolesince. However, that role taught me more than any other leadership experience.I distinctly remember election day. It was suddenly preponed, and extreme nervousness coursed through me whenwe were asked to address the house impromptu. I spoke last, following two sophomores and a ninth-gradeclassmate. After a nervous beginning, the fear washed away and my passion took over. I was elated to see my victory margin eventually.My journey as house captain was full of challenges, but they only made me stronger. We had finished last for twoyears, in fourth position. The two biggest issues were the lack of house spirit and the ridiculously low participation.My priority was to overcome these. I instituted bonding games in house meetings. Every member was encouragedto trust one another and have each other's back always, and demonstrate pride on being a member of the House.With our house master's support, I pioneered a monthly intra-house sports event for our house in every fourthhouse meeting. This helped us identify each member's strengths, thus ensuring that everyone participated in theinter-house events as per their interest. Our participation doubled that year.It took countless hours of practice and pep-talks to turn half-hearted attempts into strong performances. My sportscaptain helped me keep the squad motivated, practising repeatedly in the heat. The team's hard work bore fruit aswe won event after event.These experiences didn't just improve my public speaking and confidence levels, they taught me how to strengthenbonds, work as a team, improve productivity, make difficult decisions, and handle criticism. Being tagged as thebest house captain they could've had was icing on the cake.The high school I attended during freshman and sophomore years wasn't too flexible with subject choices forIGCSE. I've enjoyed Economics from the time I was introduced to the basics of commerce in 8th Grade. Naturally, Iwanted to take classes in IGCSE too. However, my school allowed us to take either Physics or Economics. Certainthat I wanted to study both subjects, and that I couldn't do Physics all on my own, I chose Economics as a selfstudy subject.Throughout 9th and 10th grade, I learnt Economics at home using online videos and textbooks. I tried to keep upwith my peers who attended classes in school. I gave semester exams in school to know where I stood, and to mysurprise, I topped every time. This provided me with that extra motivation and self-confidence to keep going.Although it proved challenging to balance the self-study with other school subjects, I planned ahead of time andmaintained a strict schedule to remain focused.My school did not offer Additional Mathematics at all. I only found out about the subject in 10th grade when Iattended an orientation at Singapore International School (SIS). They recommended that I take the subject if Iwanted to pursue Mathematics HL in IB. So, I self-studied Additional Mathematics for 4 months before taking theexam. I made it a point to take help from my Mathematics teacher at school whenever needed. The trick was tostay determined and not give up.Lastly, I was unable to take Computer Science classes in IGCSE. In fact, a primary reason for switching to SIS wasthat they had a good IB Computer Science program. Most students here had taken Computer Science in IGCSEand seemed to know a lot of the concepts already. Hence, the course progressed quickly. However, I worked hard,utilized my free periods to meet the teacher, and grabbed every resource available. Now, I consistently compete forthe top spot.It's been a huge challenge overcoming my IGCSE school's limitations, but I've tackled them successfully throughhard work, perseverance, and a positive attitude. My love for technology began at the age of eight when I first watched the movie Iron Man. I was in complete awe ofJ.A.R.V.I.S, the A.I. system Tony Stark built. The thought of creating this near perfect, life-like system, which, albeitabsent physically, could still perform unimaginable tasks was just astounding. What began as a fascination for J.A.R.V.I.S soon became a passion for computer science. I wanted to delvedeeper, but I had to start with basic programming. I started tinkering with QBASIC. As rudimentary as this was, itwas enough to expose me to the potential of computers.As time progressed, I taught myself basic C++ and Java. These languages made me feel uninhibited. So, whenIndia adopted a unified GST tax code, I secured an internship with a company that was developing a GST TaxEngine for large banks. The first summer, I primarily studied the indirect tax structure in India, the new tax code,the business need for the software and the proposed functionalities of the web-based application. This summer, Iwent straight from playing pickup games to the NBA! I was able to contribute to the back-end coding andrecommend improved screens for the application. Being a part of a professional software development team gaveme tremendous perspective and practical knowledge.When I visited a village school in India last summer, I identified an opportunity to use technology to transformstudents' lives. I created a mobile app to teach English to children in rural areas. The app has already beenadopted by the school and has made a huge impact on the students. It will soon be adopted by multiple schools in2 states.I'm known as the tech wizard in school. I'm the technology head for the first-ever TEDx event at school, and for mycomputer science internal assessment, I've developed a resource- management system for a client. ComputerScience isn't just my deep passion. To me, it represents the infinite potential of a synergistic relationship betweenhumans and machines, one that I want to tap into to improve as many lives as possible.",,,
102,Admitsee,3,1,2,,,,,"The bus slows to a halt, and I turn from looking out the window to observing the boarding passengers. Now that I take the train to school in a different borough, it's been a while since I've been above ground on a bus through my neighborhood. It's interesting to see the kinds of changes that have happened. A new pizza parlor. A new Sprint store in the building of the old Radio Shack. The Mexican restaurant with the cactus in front is still there though.There are three people who walk down the aisle. An old lady. A little kid holding her hand. And a girl. Then suddenly, strangeness warps into familiarity. This girl\u2026The first day of fifth grade flashes through my mind. Two people were really excited to find out that they were not only going to be in the same class, but the teacher had also seated them together at the same table. Those two people were me and the girl, Alejandro. That's right, Alejandro Garcia.I see her and I think she sees me, but our eyes miss each other, and she finds a seat a few rows behind me.Every year, I was sent home with a school quality report card, and I wouldn't understand the C my Hispanic-majority elementary school received. I did well in school, and I ended up going to the best junior high in the district. It wasn't until then that I realized what thatC meant. The stark contrast in race (my middle school was mostly white), in people who didn't eat school lunch, and in student behavior was clear - I had gone to a 'bad' school. Middle school me wanted to move to Park Slope and be like every other kid who lived in a brownstone instead of acramped apartment like mine. When I moved on to attend one of NYC's best public high schools, I realized going to a good school is a privilege because of the disparity between good schools and schools with minorities in funding, in resources, and, in turn, the environment. I learned that it was not possible to just up and move wherever was convenient,not then anyways. Everything I want, I would have to work for myself. I am a low-income, Asian female, and will-be first generation college student who comes from a long line of working class factory workers. An education means something different for everybody. For me, it is partly to help provide financial stability that never existed for my family.I found out that, some of the same people I traded stickers with during recess, they became teen moms. I wonder what I would've become if I had gone to their schools, and what they would've become if they had gone to mine. Schools shape who we are, in opportunities provided, and in values instilled. It shocked me at first to learn that NYC has one of the most segregated public school systems since the city is also known for its diversity. My educational experiences humanized the minority statistics. People who succeed in the competitive numbers game are rewarded, but there are a lot of people left behind. They are people who I know have so much potential, but are not given the means to achieve it.It's been years, and I have lost contact with everyone from my elementary school. We all started at the same place, but, evidently, our paths diverged. Still, should I pretend we never knew each other? Should I start a conversation?I turn around, and this time, we lock eyes. She must have been thinking about me too. She smiles, and I smile back. Silently, I promise her that as I achieve, I won't forget what and where I come from, and I won't forget about those left behind by the system.",,,
103,Admitsee,4.5,1,,,,,6,"There is nothing like being blasted in the face by a 2000\u00ad-degree glassworking furnace that makes a blistering summer day feel like a polar expedition. But I live for the heat mercilessly scorching my face and arms, leaving my skin pink and throbbing. I am vitalized by the blazing ball of white hot glass at the end of my blowpipe, calling forth fiery determination to pulse through my veins. The glass smiles brilliantly at me like a little sun, begging me to shape, pull, and stretch it before it loses its malleability. I move quickly with my crystalline blob to the workbench, where it is a race with the heat to swiftly alter the glass before its molten gleam dulls to an unyielding cherry tint. Some might peer into the glassworking furnace and call the flaming orb Hell, but that inferno is my Heaven.Glass is the most difficult medium with which I work, but it is my ardent favorite. A stiff cylinder of cold glass morphs gracefully into the ethereal shell of an amber purple turtle. An amorphous lump is blown, pinched, and tugged every which way to form an elegant, green vase with stripes like lace- the transformation awes me every time.Once when making a rainbow unicorn, I accidentally grazed the tip of my finger on a cooling hoof, and the glass immediately gripped and seared my flesh, puckering it before I pulled the hot glass off. For a long moment I stared dumbstruck at the pink divot where the glass had briefly kissed, like a lover trying to comprehend a betrayal. Yet the stench of burning skin aroused my mind with realization. Why would I jeopardize my body, safety, and sanity to create such tiny pieces of art? I then grasped the full power of this extraordinary medium- part of its beauty comes from the risk, which oddly invigorates and entices me. I have to be wholly present when I work with glass, to guard against any slip which could burn my skin clean off the bone. I live for the thrill, but also the immense danger of glassworking as they are perpetually interdependent. I am willing to risk everything for the wonder that strikes me every time I transform a hot, heavy glob into a sculpture of frozen light.'Can you see my inner energy\u2026,' a glass prism hums, as it refracts seemingly white light into its true brilliant rainbow. I watch entropy in action: the glass seems smooth, clear, and flawless at first, but it feeds on light, distorting brightness until the output is gleaming flecks of beautiful chaos. I love the contradictory nature of glass\u00ad- solid yet fluid, inertial yet so dynamic as it changes colors and shapes in shifting light. It's a paradox: the crystalline curves haphazardly spew out radiance in such a systematic fashion. Glass reminds me how durable yet fragile we all are, how tough and weighty we appear in our bodies, but how easily shattered we actually are.I am a creator, and I wish to forge with a free mind and limitless imagination in college and beyond. Thinking about my glassmaking reminds me of the Latin phrase 'ars longa, vita brevis'- art is long, life is short. To me, these words signify that art is forever, while life is fleeting. Even after my bodily self is gone, someone in the future will unearth one of my glass creations and behold my story and my creativity preserved in its icy depths. I want my art to endlessly inspire people well beyond my own lifetime. Art allows my imagination and ideas to withstand the test of time, and it is my way of combating the painful brevity of human life: art endures as our legacy even after mankind flickers out. Art is immortality, and we will be eternal through art.",Showing,,

106,Admitsee,3.5,,2,,,5,,"SunjaAs the sixth chapter of Min-Jin Lee's Pachinko ended, my memories of being sexually abused by my cousin resurfaced. As Sunja, the Korean protagonist, grappled with a forced marriage, I relived my own moments of captivity and coercion. As she became paralyzed with feelings of inadequacy, I retreated into a cycle of self-doubt and pain.For ten years, my mind had buried that traumatic hour. And yet, it took only a few pages of a book to bring back every minute of what had happened, first in a blur, then in horrible clarity. I tried to deny it until it couldn't be denied any longer. That night, I stayed awake, unable to think.I tried to move on, rationalizing my silence. However, a few weeks after, the silence became unbearable. I was moderating a meeting circle for the young women's professional mentorship program that I had co-founded a year prior. Each week, we would share our thoughts and experiences on a variety of topics. This week, I initiated the conversation with a question, 'How has your past informed your ambitions?'The circle began normally enough. Hoa talked about receiving criticism for being the first in her family to go to college, Ngoc relayed a childhood moment, and Nga spoke about the sexist environment of her rural hometown. When it was my turn, I wanted to say something, tell someone. But I said nothing. The circle continued clockwise.Several turns later, Huyen spoke up: 'My uncle assaulted me when I was ten. I struggled to think rationally about the assault for a long time.' Silence filled the room. I felt compelled to tell her she wasn't alone her in pain. But it was Quynh-Anh who broke the silence: 'My father abused me for two years.' As other group members offered their consolations to the two women, my compulsion to speak grew. Yet still, I couldn't. The circle dispersed.Back home, I felt disappointed in myself. For over a year, I had been working to empower these women and emphasizing the importance of being vocal, yet in their most vulnerable moment, I was not brave enough to heed my own advice. My identity as an outspoken feminist felt fraudulent, my advocacy hollow.For some reason, I found myself reaching for the familiar pages of Pachinko. Though it brought back my trauma, I felt compelled to know what happened to Sunja.When I reached the novel's powerful end, where Sunja rises above her oppression, I was struck by an overwhelming realization. Here was a work of fiction, set a century ago, in a culture foreign from my own \u2014and yet it reached beyond all those barriers to leave a lasting impact on me. Every chapter moved me, every character resonated.I finally understood the power of narrative. To tell a story is to invite others to inhabit our memories, feel our pain, experience our trauma. It creates an empathetic link that brings survivors out of isolation. It combats ignorance. It sparks action.I wasn't ready for the emotional strain of sharing my own experience before, but now I am ready to join Huyen and Quynh-Anh in our growing circle of support. I reached out to my teacher, my counselor, and now to you. With each telling, I gain more confidence to tell others, until, eventually, I face my family.No matter what the repercussions, I will remain a storyteller, not just retelling my own trauma but also transmitting to the community the urgent need to protect women. I see myself adding my voice to those of journalists and activists who have alerted the world to the sexually assaulted women Rohingya refugees, to the Indian rape survivors who live in inequity, to the confined, the marginalized, the neglected. By speaking out, we gain strength; by empowering others to speak, we step away from the pain of the past and move closer towards justice.",,,

But, I remember you, and I'vemade it my life's mission to help people like you.I still remember, it was a muggy Friday afternoon when I walked to shop with my latest obsession withSchrodinger's thought experiment stuck on my mind. Amid the cacophony of traffic, I heard the squeaky voice of ateen clad in an excuse of a shirt.'Please, spare me some change,' you said in a trivially childish voice. After a brief moral war, I handed you a 10rupee note and shot a question 'Why don't you go to school?' to which you answered 'There is no school that myfather can afford. When that changes, I will go.' You said this with a practiced, nonchalant shrug - one thatmasked the weight of a tumultuous childhood.Problems are funny little gremlins; when they're ours, problems are nothing but a hindrance - but, when theybelong to others, problems become an opportunity. They offer a chance at greatness. So, when I first met you, Irecognized that it was my time to rise above.I have problems of my own, too; like the time I had to take the reins and steer my family's business after my dadsustained serious injuries in an accident leaving me with the option to work else family would starve. But overallexperience was very rich as I learned ethics of business and the value of mental fortitude. I thought my plight wasmiserable but after meeting you I realized kids like you had it worse.I spent countless hours thinking about what I could do for children like you and soon realized that I can at leastteach children like you.Soon, I started my own social venture TechSoCh, Technology for Social Change, with other motivated individualsfrom not only India but also from six other third world countries. We realized the problem was at a very basic level.Poverty cannot be averted by simply giving bookish knowledge but a lot of work needed to be done and the firstthing was to make people aware of government policies and their rights. Then there were challenges ofmalnutrition, employment generation, lack of basic infrastructure etc. We started working on all fronts likeengaging youths in skill development programs, distributing food in underprivileged areas, taking classes of smallchildren and encouraging them for studies, making women and other family members aware of all governmentpolicies and their rights to get those benefits etc.The State Government, after noticing our work, invited me to work on their child development projects andawarded me with a Certificate of Honour. I imagined you up on the dais being handed the award with me.Shahzaib, I want you to know that your efforts are not in vain - you are not unrecognized. I recognize that ourexistence is but a tiny speck in the wheel of time and that my efforts may never amount to anything significantgiven the scale of poverty, illiteracy, and unemployment within our country. Still, my stubborn heart remainsunconvinced, because I am steadfast.Our paths have not since crossed, but I hope that my efforts - and those of better men - have touched your lifethrough TechSoCH- an initiative to bring a positive change in the society with the help of science & technology.I imagine you in school, learning and growing to meet your full potential. I wonder if you're now aware that yourname means 'Crown of the King.' Shahzaib, I know it may be but a dream, but I hope you will join me. For, even ifwe fail, we will have devoted great effort to the greater good.I hope you will remember me as more than a stranger on the street.Abhinav.""},{""index"":1,""personal_essay"":""I've found Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence alluring for a long time.

108,Admitsee,3,,,3,,,,"I'd always agreed with Mr. Butler during his frequent after-dinner political conversations with my father. As my dad, a staunch Republican, and Terry, a self-declared socialist, debated I would sit on my dad's lap and defend every point he made. This blind acceptance was short-lived. The older I got, and the more I was exposed to other beliefs, my faith in my parents' politics was challenged. By Obama's second term, I vigorously endorsed the 'standard liberal position.' One evening, the topic was inequality in public education. Terry got up to refill his drink and said, 'Not that you'd even look at their website, but The Atlantic had an article about how teachers' unions want nationalized standards in schools.' Predictably, my dad disagreed. He chuckled 'You're right I'd never look at that' then rebuked, 'The mayor's office has to get involved, the federal government's overreach never helped anyone.' My dad's point wasn't a pillar of conservatism, but it hinged on decidedly conservative notions of self-sufficiency and small government.I had never been a shy person so, I jumped to counter his point, ' That's not actually\u2026' I hesitated and trailed off.I'd assumed that by the time those words had left my mouth a plethora of appropriate responses based on the democratic party's platform values would be on the tip of my tongue. I wasn't prepared for a lack of a counterpoint.I began to realize that my dad was right, at least he was this time. I even found myself disagreeing with Terry's more liberal solution for federal intervention. I'd never imagined that I would be in agreement with a card-carrying Republican, but there I was arguing against the most liberal man I knew with Republican logic. I was confused. It wasn't the logic behind the argument that confused me. That made sense. It was that I'd never seen merit in a conservative stance, not one on economics or social policy or foreign affairs. It had been my understanding that the 'standard liberal position' I'd always endorsed simply had the better answer.The idea that something so central to my belief system may have been untrue unnerved me, so I tried to correct this bias. I went out of my way to speak with the few vocal conservatives at my middle school and even asked if I could meet with a Republican city councilor. The common ground I found led me to see that no one party had the 'right,' infallible solution all of the time and more importantly that even beliefs I'd assumed were 100% right had to be questioned. I realized the value in speaking to people with different beliefs, not to convince them of my own but to recognize the faults in my conclusions instead of listening to an echo chamber that constantly agreed with me. I still talked a lot, but now I was much more willing to have what I said be questioned.So the next time I turned around in the front seat of my mom's car to tell my brother just why he was wrong about whatever stance he'd taken on our most recent argument, I bit my tongue and asked him to explain himself. This new attitude has allowed me to be more critical of my own thoughts and, after hearing how others saw the issue, better defend my points or change them if necessary. I could see the value in accepting the criticism that exposure to opposing views gave me instead of the comfort that an echo chamber provides. I used to think that the more evidence I had to support my ideas, the more right I was. I was wrong, incredibly so. It isn't how many facts or figures or points I have to corroborate my ideas to justify my views, it's how many opposing arguments I've been willing to hear. My first camera was given to me by my godfather on my ninth birthday. The old Olympus OM-1 was dented and scratched, but I loved it. From that day on I was entranced by how the way a shot was framed or filtered could completely change the piece. Throughout high school, I pursued every photography course offered including Senior Thesis Photography. I knew the teacher, Mrs. Tanzman, well, but was nervous to be in a class that required an application and to be surrounded by peers who had made it through a similar vetting process.Our first assignment was a three-piece series and I spent hours perfecting it. Mrs. Tanzman's feedback made it clear these efforts were in vain. She said that if I didn't utilize the 'rules' of the field, like the rule of thirds, then the quality of my work would stagnate. Her critiques came as a surprise, I'd never received such harsh feedback, and they felt like a challenge to my prior compositions. I began to question if photography could still be my stress reliever if improving meant following these guidelines, but I made the changes to my color balance and cropping anyway and the results proved Mrs.Tanzman right. What I'd once thought was a well-composed series was revealed to be disjointed and lacking a unifying theme. The idea that seemingly subjective art could be created by manipulating something as concrete as the rule of thirds fascinated me. I'd always seen photography as a fundamentally creative undertaking, but I'd never realized that the structure that the new concepts provided fostered innovative work rather than inhibiting it. I began to see every project as an opportunity to build off of the framework that these 'new' rules provided rather than a blank canvas that would accept whatever I put onto it. This approach helped me learn to work with rather than against the rules not just during photography class.",,,

110,Admitsee,4,1,,,,,6,"I live in two different worlds.One is the world of Newton and Galileo, of Calculus and Physics, of molecules and hydrogen bonds, of differential equations and integrals--the objective realm. In this world, every object and being is a collection of atoms which obeys the laws of physics and acts logically.A Beethoven symphony is a series of disruptions of molecules in the air which vibrates the eardrum, perceived by the somatosensory cortex as certain sounds. The Grand Canyon's colors are a collection of light energy interacting with the molecules of the rocks, eventually reflecting to the retina and processed as an image by the occipital lobe.Emotion is simply the work of neurotransmitters. You feel good after going for a run? That's because of the endorphin rush. You're crying at the end of The Fault in Our Stars? Thank your limbic system for the waterworks.The universe isn't nearly that straightforward, though. That's where the second world comes into play.This is the world of Shakespeare and Hemingway, of love and fear, of Dickens and Dickinson, of poetry and prose--the subjective sphere. This world explains why we do crazy things for love, why your heart swells after reading Of Mice and Men and why you buy an HBO subscription just to watch Game of Thrones.In this world, a Beethoven symphony is eloquent, sound waves aside. The Grand Canyon is a thing of beauty, regardless of light energy.I am torn between these two schools of thought, day in and day out. I love the order of a physics equation and the logic of calculus. At the same time, the cold reasoning of science did not console my broken heart after my girlfriend broke up with me, A Farewell to Arms did.I've explored both science and the humanities. My poetry and writing won numerous Scholastic Arts awards; I scored an 800 on my Math II subject test and a 36 on ACT math. By the end of high school, I'll have taken nearly equal numbers of AP classes in the humanities and in STEM (five and six, respectively). Outside of the classroom, I read Don Quixote for fun, and then I read The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, a book about clinical neurology, for fun. I helped found my school's political union; I am also a proud member of my school's varsity math team. On Tuesdays, I volunteer as a writing mentor for my peers. On Thursdays, I tutor underprivileged kids in math.I oftentimes feel torn between the subjective and the objective. Am I like Switzerland, refusing to choose a side? At worst, I am a double agent. At best, I am a Renaissance man.I can see two parallel futures playing out. In one, I am a professor of classical literature, giving lectures about Dostoevsky and Steinbeck in a pair of tortoiseshell glasses. In the other, I am a neurologist, reading an EEG in a white lab coat. Maybe my future isn't completely binary. One of my inspirations, Dr. Paul Kalanithi, bridged the gap between these two dissonant worlds. Though his life was cut short by cancer, he managed to be both a leading neurosurgeon and a prominent writer, a graduate of Stanford Med and a New York Times bestselling author.To be honest, I'm not sure where I will be in four years. I could say I'm leaning towards neurobiology, but I'm not going to declare a major. Instead, I'm simply going to declare a thirst to learn and an eagerness to further explore both the worlds of science and the humanities.",,,
111,Admitsee,4,1,,,4,,6,"When I was born 9 weeks early and two pounds lighter than average, the only family present was my mom. And that's how it has always been, in our small family with the same makeup as a hydrogen atom \u2013 a mother nucleus and daughter electron. My childhood was one filled with exploration, in our tiny apartment overflowing with books. My mom helped me go at my own pace, so I read chapter books at 3\u00bd. Questions, no matter how strange, were permitted and encouraged, leading me to sit in the bathroom at eight reading the Economist, calling out down the hall asking who this person was, what this word meant, because I refused to wait until I was done. New books were constantly appearing, so new questions always arose. I thought my mother was an endless vessel of information, and was shocked when she didn't contain the answer I wanted. But I loved when we subsequently crowded around a computer screen, or scoured the local library for the answer, where my little fingers would write it down in the 'Question Notebook' we had purchased because I loved its cover of cats. Now, more bookshelves line the tiny apartment. Old favourites have been packed away in boxes and put in storage. But for me the world keeps expanding with facts and possibilities. The Economist is still read, but understood more. Wired and Scientific American have joined it. Now, as I learn things, I search for connections. Reading about technology has led to coding courses, fashion to sewing courses, and political affairs to Model United Nations. Now my mother comes to me with questions.Home has become a kind of constitutional monarchy \u2013 the Momarch has the final word, but democracy exists, for efficiency's sake. Disagreements are rare. There is no alternative but communication. There is no other parent for me to run to, no sibling to support my side of the argument, only the judge and the defendant self-representing. We talk. Sure, there are still typical teen-parent spats, with 'you don't get it!' and 'put your phone down right now!' But mostly, it is a peaceful existence, a unity of parasitism and mutualism in one place, the electron orbiting the nucleus.It will not be long before everything changes. The small apartment will be much quieter. The orbiting daughter electron will become a free electron, and the nucleus will be alone; the end of hydrogen. To the nucleus, it will quickly become too quiet. There will be no one to drive around, to tell her about Star Wars theories, about what the 9th graders did this time, about what book she has to read. And the free electron? For the first little while, she'll enjoy being Riannon-the-university-student, going to bed when she wants to, buying and eating an entire cake if she feels like it. Missing mom won't arrive until the 3rd week at the earliest, depending on how much we talk. Initially, she'll be the one calling, ensuring I'm arriving to class on time, that I'm not eating just bread for lunch because I don't want to cook. But then I'll be calling her. No one will yet be able to understand my light-speed rate of speaking. I won't know who will likely know the answer to strange questions on-the-go, who probably knows what the word on the tip of my tongue is. And I'll realize, I miss her. But, I'll be okay. I know how to be on my own. I know my mother fostered my creative and knowledge-seeking spirit; my search for knowledge will be lifelong. I won't be limited by the extent of my experiences, but made stronger by them. All those books about the adventures of others let me know it is my turn. So I will venture out nervously but excitedly on my own, ready to do one of my favourite things: explore.",,,

113,Admitsee,5,1,,3,4,,,"So, whose house am I dropping you off at?'The harmless question invited a sharp pang of anxiety in my stomach that came every time someone asked me about my family. This time, I was 12, and my friend's dad was driving us home from a bat mitzvah in Coney Island.Without lifting my firm gaze from the floor of the car, I shakily explained that it was my mom's house; my parents were divorced and my brother lived in Philadelphia with my dad and his wife. This was far from the truth, and I hoped that my voice wouldn't betray me. The familiar, agonizing guilt settled in. I quickly reassured myself that I would never have to see this father again, that the guilt was better than facing the dreadful reaction I had conjured up in my head. When I lied similarly to close friends, I knew it was wrong. But, I felt protected.In reality, I was raised by five gay parents: my mom, two dads, and two other moms. They have filled my life with nonstop support and an admiration of all things unconventional, something I took for granted. At seven, I perched on my dad's shoulders at a pride parade in D.C., eagerly looking out at a sea of rainbow flags in the hands of impassioned queer people and feeling a surge of delirium that I had never experienced before. At 11, I witnessed my moms crying and shouting 'We won!!' the day New York State passed the marriage equality law. These moments were miraculous to me, but I trapped them inside.Growing up, I felt painfully abnormal. My moms and dads encouraged me to bravely explore the Barbie section at Target and celebrated that I wanted to dress up as Snow White on Halloween; they never questioned why I didn't hang out with other boys. But, as I got older, peers started to point out these trivial differences, taunting me about my feminine mannerisms and my unapologetic joy. I developed an internalized homophobia that deeply influenced my perception of my family and myself. I did not want people to know about my parents because I thought it would reveal that I was gay, something I deemed the epitome of otherness.As I slowly grasped what it did to me, my interaction with this hidden part of my identity, my avoidance of who I truly was, has propelled me to care deeply about my communities. Now, as a 17 year old, I have grown to reject shame and embrace pride.I am drawn to people who are authentically and proudly themselves. I find solace in interacting with different groups at school\u2014Rainbow Club, Diversity Initiative, Bollywood Club\u2014formed by people who are proud of their identities and want to share them. They taught me to do the same. I am involved with the DI because I want to help create the inclusive and supportive community at my school that I lacked before.Outside of school, I harness the power of images to further express internalized facets of my self. The spring of my junior year, I spent numerous hours a week in the International Center of Photography's color darkroom, printing portraits of my parents. For the final exhibition of my photo intensive, I put them and the courage I've gained on display, exploring my family's construct and my identity. This meaningful, personal endeavor represented four years of self-directed change.My understanding of my personal truth is in flux. Yet, calibrating these two sides of my life has yielded a newfound self-liberation, enabling me to act, speak, and live empathetically. When I tell people about my family now, with a genuine grin, I open myself up to the world, and I can feel the world opening up to me.",,,
114,Admitsee,3.5,1,2,,,,,"Would my family be a sitcom or a soap opera?If there is any phrase I could use to describe my family life, it would be the 'domino effect.' A problem or a spark would ignite a fire that would engulf our whole existence.It all started with my birth. While I was lucky to come into the world easily, my twin brother did not have that privilege. He incurred birth defects, one of which cost him nerve control and the ability to walk. Thanks to my mother's devotion, he eventually showed great progress in walking, but then he was diagnosed with epilepsy. My father began to consume alcohol and abuse my mother, leading to their divorce. When that was over, my sister was diagnosed with rheumatism and my mother with sciatica, bringing sleepless nights and uncountable visits to the hospital. In turn, my other sister developed depression and even attempted suicide. Following that, my older brother became addicted to drugs. My eldest brother, despite graduating from college, is unemployed with no intention of getting a job, and my mother cried on a near daily basis.As you can imagine, those times were a disaster. To be honest, even I do not know precisely how I made it through. I know however, that whenever I considered giving up, my mother's face popped into my head. She needed me and looked to me hopefully to achieve what my other siblings did not, like getting into a prestigious college, graduating, being a productive part of society, and a pillar supporting our family.My upbringing developed a peculiar mix of pessimism and optimism in my character. I became addicted to inspirational quotes and comedy shows, both of which brought me solace. In middle school, I discovered Anime, which was the source of a quote I cherished very much. I still remember that quote: 'You can't live because you are not strong? Wrong! Only living shows your strength.' That quote, coupled with my mother's image in my head were what propelled me forward, and propel me it did.I remember at 5 when my brother was diagnosed with epilepsy, how I had to adapt to the sight of my twin brother getting seizures, how I learned determination and compassion out of my mother's dedication to teaching him, and how I started sketching to play with him. I remember at 11 when my mother was first diagnosed with sciatica, how I had to take over and handle cooking and cleaning, how I learned that you should never look at onions when you cut them, and not use too much dish soap or bubbles will come out of the sink. I remember at 13 when my sister was diagnosed with rheumatism, how I had to learn how to administer physical therapy, and occasionally, how to braid someone's hair for her. I remember at 15 when my other sister showed signs of depression and even attempted suicide, how I taught her sketching to express her feelings, how she in turn taught me basic knitting, and how we both collaborated to make a dress as a gift for my mother.Fortunately, my life is not a roller coaster anymore. My mother and sister are doing great through physical therapy. My dad stopped consuming alcohol and I am actually currently living with him. My other sister and older brother are doing great through therapy. In fact, both are currently pursuing degrees in humanities, and my twin brother, despite his impairments, became the top student in his graduating class.Despite the darkness of those times, I don't regret experiencing them. For only darkness lets you see light, and instead of remaining in darkness, I became a light that shone on my family.",,,

117,Admitsee,4,,,3,,,,"The Prime-ary Challenge'You will finish your classes later today,' announced my teacher as we heard the sound of sirens that pulled us to the windows.'Must be an official, has such a huge escort,' said my classmate, adding a flavor of curiosity to our perplexed emotions. To soothe the atmosphere, I added, 'Yeah, one wrong word against them, they'll take you away.' This is a common Armenian saying, forged during the dictatorial Soviet era that succeeded in oppressing the public opinion and eliminating free discourse so fundamentally that my joke still bore a spoonful of actuality.Asked to take our seats, we learned the identity of our guest only after he entered our classroom. An instant wave of surprise and discomfort made me feel the possible imminence of my conversation with him\uff0dwith someone whose political views and those of mine are at odds\uff0dwith the Prime Minister of Armenia. Luckily, my principal started presenting our school. But when we were asked to give questions to the Prime Minister, our teacher broke the proceeding unpleasant silence, 'Mr. Prime Minister, we would like to know what the current situation on the Karabakh-Azerbaijani border is.' The Prime Minister reasserted of the relative calmness on the border, adding, 'The new powerful weaponry from our primary ally, Russia, ensures strengthened security and...'An electric shock immediately passed through my body and evoked my fresh memories about the devastating war in April 2016 in Nagorno Karabakh where our \\\u2018ally' has been actively intervening. And on top of this, Armenia's (forceful?) joining an economic union, ruled by \\\u2018our ally' and favored by the Prime Minister, underscores the cynicism of our political reality. But despite my desire to speak up, my inner voice bombarded me with questions: 'Should I discard my own opinion? Should I counter the Prime Minister?' The Armenian joke revisited me, this time however not generating laughter, rather anger towards myself and others reluctant to voice their opinions. This made me overcome dubiety and act. I raised my hand.The Prime Minister stopped to take my question. 'Mr. Prime Minister, but don't you think we should reconsider our relations with Russia? For many years this country triggers war by supplying weaponry to both belligerent states, instead of being the pacifist liaison between the two. Would it not be fallacious to call that country our ally?'I was relieved. I challenged the Prime Minister's and his supporters' views, but above all, myself and the Armenian identity that had been indoctrinated to unwaveringly accept ideas from \\\u2018above'. Well, breaking the \\\u2018wall' certainly hurt. Yet upon realizing I stepped outside the box, I felt empowered, shouting to let the world know it is possible, albeit some \\\u2018glances of disapproval'. One belonged to my principal who whispered to my teacher, 'Does this kid know who he is talking to?'The Prime Minister's answer proved me more. Listing several advantages of reinforcing our ties with Russia, some solid though not mind-altering, he concluded, 'In any case, this is our only way.' This was when I realized that the Prime Minister conceded: we appeared on the same ground, one of discussion and mutual understanding. Looking back, I understand how powerful debate is and realize that I also challenged those who discourage political divergence and mock the opposition for 'wasting time' confronting the government, thinking nothing can be reached, anyway. Well, they say when two things crash, both suffer. However, when two opposing ideas do, we see them collide, intertwine, spiral, and blossom. And it is beautiful to see how both benefit from the interchange of ideas and reach a compromise. Although my little chat with the Prime Minister was not an exemplar of a debate, it did prove eye-opening to me. They didn't take me away\u2026 I had a powerful weapon\u2026 my willingness to discuss.",,,
118,Admitsee,3.5,1,2,,,,,"Hi Man Hing. Pick up or delivery?'Whether I liked it or not, this phrase has and will continue to follow me throughout my entire life\u2014and not just because I say it about 100 times a day. Growing up as a Chinese kid in a predominantly Caucasian area, I was often alienated because of my foreign lifestyle. Not taking into account the cruel, savage nature of children, I often blamed myself for not fitting in with the status quo. The worst offender that allocated me as an 'outlier' was my parents' Chinese take-out restaurant right in town: Man Hing. With relentless 'ching chongs' and comments about using cats and dogs in our food, I quickly grew to resent my family restaurant and the albatross it hung around my neck. Rather than sharing and appreciating my Fuzhounese culture, I began to bury my roots and Americanize myself as much as possible. Adding to the fiery resentment that burned within, I was stripped of my childhood and thrown into the workforce at the age of 11. Taking orders, working the cash register, preparing food\u2014this is not what a child should be doing at such a young age. I found my grades faltering because 'I had work.' I took the easiest classes available, never challenging myself, knowing that I could use the restaurant as an excuse for having no time to focus on school.However, something felt inexplicably wrong about my mediocre lifestyle. On a blustery October night in 2012, Hurricane Sandy ran rampant through Fair Lawn. The ceiling lights flickered on and off until the restaurant was consumed in what I thought was a void of darkness. Our phones provided glimpses of light in the pitch-black store, revealing obscurities I had never seen before. My petulant, 13 year-old mind that was once shrouded in the darkness of spite had cleared up seeing my parents' stressed, pale faces. While they could have weathered the storm in the comfort of our home, they ran the restaurant during the hurricane, keeping my best interests in mind.The torrential storm blew away the darkness within my mind and brought light upon the privilege and fortune Man Hing has brought to my life. I started to realize the strain that this restaurant put on my parents. They worked countless hours every day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. My parents slaved over vats of boiling oil and woks full of General Tso's Chicken all so that I could have everything I needed in life. Man Hing wasn't a curse; it was a blessing.After finally acknowledging my ignorance as a child, I felt the need to work harder\u2014not only at the restaurant, but also at school. By immersing myself in both worlds, all different facets of my life benefitted from my newfound determination. I grew to love the satisfaction of helping customers and receiving a warm, genuine smile in return for my service. I grew to love exploring my innate, intellectual curiosity by working to my full potential in school. And I grew to love Man Hing and all that my culture has to offer through the ethnic foods and traditions the restaurant exposed me to.No matter where the future may take me, I will never forget that I owe my success to the place that gave me so much more than just an income. Man Hing has given birth to my love for service and helped to cultivate my insatiability for knowledge. Man Hing has taught me to work hard for what I want and to rise above petty discouragement. Man Hing has been my second home for the past 17 years and inspired me to be proud of the person that I am today. In essence, Man Hing has made me an outlier.",,,
119,Admitsee,2,,,,,5,6,"Le Papillon des \u00c9toiles by Bernard Werber I discovered sealed boxes labeled 'fourth grade' in storage. It had been six years since my family emigrated from Korea, but because of the frequent moves over the years, some of our belongings were perpetually being packed and unpacked in U-Haul boxes. In one such box, I picked up a book with a pretty metallic engraving of a butterfly: a copy ofLe Papillon des \u00c9toiles translated into Korean. The metallic butterfly jogged my memory of how my younger self had been so immersed in the story of escaping tarnished humanity on Earth and restarting civilization on a distant planet. Seven years later as a high school junior, I read the book in French. While in fourth grade Werber's creativity had drawn me into his microcosm parallel to our current world, I recently came to realize that his work isn't simply a work of science fiction. Instead, it is an expos\u00e9 on how society is ruining the Earth for future generations. The tarnished humanity Werber described was overlapped with the news of terrorism, hate, and insensitivity I read everyday. I started to worry about what would happen if the world continued as Werber foreshadowed; it prompted me to take responsive measures to improve the society around me. This epiphany initiated my first step of metamorphosis, my process of crawling out of boundaries to transform his words into action. My second stage of metamorphosis began in the summer of 2015 when I walked into the grandiose headquarters of Goldman Sachs in Manhattan for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. A confounding, yet encouraging feeling came over me, similar to that of the astronomer, Yves, when he first met and asked a billionaire for support to continue his mission inLe Papillon des \u00c9toiles. Although the technical aspect of learning how to code captivated me, the best part was experiencing that I could make a truly meaningful difference in people's lives, as I co-created NuMe, a pregnancy tracking web application designed to assist low-income women.Watching working women test our website and getting positive feedback was both gratifying and motivating; I felt inspired to find more ways in which I could use my passion for technology to positively impact others. The next stage of my metamorphosis developed during my time as an intern at the United Nations. At the UN, I wanted to delve deeper into technological accessibility in the the world. After scouring the UN Library, I was disappointed with the scarcity of information on this issue. However, I was introduced to the manager of the Applications Development Team in the UN Population Fund. He invited me to demonstrate my project, NuMe. In the presentation, he gave me feedback for further improvement and we shared the passion of helping others using technology. He also introduced me to his team projects for Sub-Saharan Afri1) ResearchI conducted two environmental research projects with my partner, Jordan Sanford, since sophomore year. Our first project was the Utilization of Optical Fibers to Maximize Algal Biofuel Production, in which we extracted glycerides from microalgae, Scenedesmus obliquus, that was irradiated with light, delivered by a solar powered optical fiber net to enhance algal lipid production, thereby producing an alternative renewable fuel. This project received Honors Award at the Long Island Science Congress and Syosset High School Advanced Research Award, given to four students per grade.Following is an abstract for our second research, Utilization of Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) asa Shewanella putrefaciens ATP Synthase Inhibitor to Maximize Microbial Fuel Cell Performance, done in- school throughout my junior year and completed over the summer.This project was awarded as a 2016 Siemens Semi-Finalist project.Traditional processes to purify wastewater are ineffective, costly, and time consuming. The byproducts of these methods are harmful to the environment as well. Microbial fuel cells (MFC) provide a promising new method of wastewater treatment using a single-step process that limits the amount of sludge produced. Since current efforts have not been effective enough to replace traditional wastewater treatment methods, this study sought to create a more realistic approach to MFC water purification. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) was the main variable tested to determine if purified water output could be increased by inhibiting the ATP Synthase enzyme of Shewanella putrefaciens, a facultative anaerobe. Two novel MFC structures tested the hypothesis. Both 300 mg and 600 mg of EGCg per liter of wastewater did not create a high enough concentration in the MFC to have a noticeable effect on performance; however, the final results of the experimentation showed a drastic effect at a 900 mg\/L concentration due to an increased voltage produced by the MFC. To improve the performance of MFCs, past studies have resorted to using expensive and rare materials. Our findings indicate that bacterial chemiosmosis modification can result in improved MFC performance when compared to current efforts.2) Chamber Music Performance at Lincoln CenterI was the chamber music quartet leader of one of eleven winning groups selected from the Tri-State area, and received two coaching sessions from pianist Alessio Bax.

121,Admitsee,3.5,1,,,,,,"Wide right, the forward lateral pass leading to the infamous Music City Miracle, and a playoff drought as old as I am \u2013 seventeen years, to be exact.The Buffalo Bills have a reputation among the National Football League as a team of yearly high expectations and inevitable failure. Tabloids and social media have dubbed Bills fans some of the most passionate in the League, focusing on the notorious tailgate culture. While these perceptions of outsiders aren't contestable, the impact of the Bills on the city and its residents encompasses much more.It is one o'clock, and my Buffalo-native family is either circled up around the TV in our living room or relishing in the electric atmosphere of New Era Field, awaiting kickoff \u2013 the scene of almost every football Sunday since I can remember. Before I could speak in full sentences, my father taught me to raise my arms and yell 'touchdown.' It wouldn't surprise me to find out that it was my first word. When my Puerto Rican great- grandparents would join us, Spanish subtitles would roll across the bottom of the screen, allowing them to keep up with the quick play-calling. The noise in the stadium was deafening as our family joined 71,000 other Bills fans donning jerseys of former first-round picks, each hoping for a playoff berth.The scene was much different on October 18, 2015. The Buffalo Bills were playing the Cincinnati Bengals, coming into the game with a 3 and 2 record. Instead of being with my entire family, as Sundays had been for years prior, I stood shivering on the field as the first snow of the season fell. There I watched, uncomfortably sandwiched between my dad and his then girlfriend, now wife, following a messy divorce between my parents. After two years, this was my first voluntary interaction with the two of them together \u2013 all in the name of not missing the game. For a time before this, I would watch the games alone in my room, armed with the companionship of homemade chicken wing dip. The cold shoulder that I had been giving my father was comparable to the harshness of Buffalo winters.At the time, I had supported the Bills through fifteen years of exciting road wins, but even more losses that crushed any and all hopes of playoffs for that season. Each year, though, Buffalo fans would handle such adversity with grace, continuing to support the team through the low points for the sake of the community. I came to realize that I should approach my new family dynamic in such a manner. Instead of holding grudges against players and management when times got tough, I would look to the next season for improvement. Likewise, instead of jeopardizing my inseparable father-daughter relationship by holding onto the bitterness I felt about the situation between my parents, I moved on.The ability of Buffalo sports fans to handle hardship and move on from the tough times sets us apart from many other fan bases across the country and is one of the most important building blocks of our community. Furthermore, it is a skill that I am grateful to have acquired. A life without setbacks does not exist, but growing up in Buffalo has provided me with the ability to approach each difficulty with poise. I have learned the sheer importance of a belonging to a solid community, whether it be my immediate family or a city with a population of 250,000.My hometown and its NFL team have taught me all that I need to know about football; I can ramble about routes and blitz plays for days. More important, though, are the lessons I have learned from every win and loss. Wherever I end up, I will take the heart of Buffalo with me.",,,

After decades, the glass that was once ugly and untouchable now has a soft, smooth patina that encourages one to bend over and pick it up. The lapping of the waves will bring these pieces of sea glass back from the depths of the ocean and scatter them all over the beach.I keep a firm grip on the large hands encompassing my smaller six-year-old ones while my parents and I slowly make our way down the brisk and somewhat gloomy Alki Beach in West Seattle. To assuage my irrational fear, I gaze up at the tall figures on either side of me and know that neither have left me. I find my eyes drawn to the recently shaved head of my dad and remember the night our lives restarted, the night we learned he had brain cancer. I tighten my grip on my parents' hands because this outing is one of the first since his seizure, surgery, and chemotherapy. Now we all have to face the most difficult challenge: healing and overcoming the fear that saturates our lives. Our little group, bonded by the trials of the past three months, makes its way down the beach. Our individual lines of sight slowly scan the gray, rugged, and sandy ground under our feet. A glint of light from the beach a foot ahead of me catches my eye and causes me to stop. A jagged piece of clear broken glass rests on the sand.Several year later, the coarse sand crunches under my feet as I scour that same beach for the small pieces of sea glass that are my treasure. Behind me, I hear the gentle crunching of my parents feet on sand. I can still feel their support while we continue on our shared quest that started in this place more than ten years ago. Back home, the overflowing jars and bowls filled with the small green, white, brown, and the occasional blue shards testify to time devoted to combing beaches. I concentrate completely on the ever-changing square foot of beach directly beneath me as I hunt. An unexpected gust of cool air causes me to tighten my fleece jacket. A smile makes its way across my face as I breathe in the saline Seattle scent that permeates the city. That smile stays in place because my dad just received his tenth and final cancer-free MRI. His cancer no longs looms over us with the fear of recurrence. I come to a stop as I spy a morsel of opaque and almost luminescent white sea glass. I let the wonder of my discovery overcome me. I look back over my shoulder at my parents with a hopeful smile and brush my thumb over the velvety surface of the glass.",Showing,Setting,
123,Admitsee,4,1,2,,,,,"As I sit, staring into the abyss of the Boston skyline, I feel as though I am living an out-of-body experience. So small in such a big world, I believe that I am undeserving of the cards that life has dealt me. My eyes quietly scan the faces of my cohort sitting near me, their utterly blank looks speaking more than their words ever could. I suspect that my expression mirrors theirs. We are in complete awe of what we are seeing: the towering buildings in front of us speak firmly, calling us closer. On the horizon, buildings are lit, each reflecting a uniquely tinted iridescence. Higher than any of the skyscrapers, the moon peeks its way out from behind the spotty clouds. It shines brighter than any building, almost boasting of its natural beauty compared to the artificiality of the man-made architecture it was shadowing.Looking around, I take in the sight of the campus I am overlooking- Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I have been given the opportunity to be a part of MITES, Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science, a rigorous STEM summer program. Surrounded by a tight-knit community of like-minded individuals, I feel that I am completely underwhelming. Who would have thought that I, from small-town Wisconsin, would be sitting atop a Cambridge building? I look around, trying to put the pieces of my own life together. The orbs of rain cascading from the thin clouds bring me back to reality. My friends have scattered amongst themselves, the first signs of life since our earlier ascent. Their conversations are nothing more than background music to my concurrent symphony.I dive deeper into the infinite depth of my roaming mind, wandering back once again to the thoughts of being undeserving. I have felt this before, like I am 'cheating life'- almost as if I have been given more than I deserve. This concept, however, stems from something much deeper than just one summer program. In this moment, painful memories rush to mind. At the age of four, after being abandoned by my biological parents, I was adopted. Having been literally given a new chance to be successful and loved in life is the stem of my greatest insecurity. Not being the 'right person' in the moment, constantly comparing, I easily identify my own flaws and wonder why I am given opportunities that I have been given.The rushing wind sweeps me out of my memories. Taking in the sight of the skyline, I peer beyond the buildings as individual pieces of architecture, but observe them as a whole. The buildings are all unique. Some are huge, while others are short and long, stretching out on the ground beneath. Their varying appearances spark a realization for me. Just like the buildings that make up the Boston skyline, which act as perfect complements to one another, I am merely a piece to a puzzle. Whether that puzzle be a school community, my family, cohort or best friends, I belong where I am, fully deserving. I have worked hard to get where I am today, and I am the rightful owner of my opportunities and successes. The 'puzzle' wouldn't be complete without me.Smiling, I take one last glance at the skyline. Numb legs stretching, I begin to shuffle towards the creaky ladder that guided my journey up what seemed like a lifetime ago. Starting to descend, I remind myself that although I may not always feel deserving of the life I have been given to live, I am. I am merely a piece to a bigger puzzle, a bigger community, and a bigger world. At three in the morning and two thousand miles from my house, the cold, industrial skyline makes me feel warmer and more at home than ever before.I live a crazy life with three younger sisters. Making it more complex is my youngest sister, Isabella. Isabella has congenital heart disease and calcification of the heart, sending her heart into failure. She is currently experiencing the last stage of failure before being placed on the heart transplant list. With her barrage of medical complexities, she is constantly in and out of the hospital. My mother stays with Isabella at the hospital. My father, who works a full-time job, often has to take off of work to be with them both. With frequent stays at the hospital, it has become my responsibility to take care of my sisters, which includes getting them to school, cooking meals, tutoring, and being the person that they need to lean on for emotional support. Because my father isn't always able to work, I occasionally have to financially support my family.With these experiences in mind, I can say without certainty that one of my greatest skills has become leadership. I have been forced to grow up, taking on a lot of responsibility. It is common for me to have to take on the role of 'parent' when my parents cannot be with us, all while struggling to hold it together emotionally for my sister's sake. Contributing to my family as a leader when necessary lifts a huge weight off of my parent's shoulders, making it slightly easier to enjoy the few years we have left with Isabella. Not only do I use these newfound leadership skills at home, but I now see them emerging at school as well. I am becoming more involved in the leadership of my extracurricular activities, and in the classroom, I am the student that others look up to for not only academic help but also as a leader. Although extremely challenging and never wished upon, Isabella's illness has taught me valuable life lessons. It has taught me skills that I will continue to cultivate wherever I attend college and wherever life takes me.",,,
124,Admitsee,3.5,1,,,4,,,"Arroz con gandules: More than a Meal'Corta la cebolla, mamacita.'Replying with a fervent nod and 'S\u00ed, mam\u00e0,' I braced for oncoming tears and cut the onion necessary for arroz con gandules, the staple recipe in our household.Since I was a child, I patiently waited and watched my abuela, mother, and aunts prepare a mouthwatering dish with the most aromatic smell in the world. After an exhausting school day, just one whiff of the delectable food instantly revitalizes me. This certain scent, which I can solely describe with the word 'home,' results from white rice mixed with colorful vegetables, pigeon peas, and a savory condiment that explodes your taste buds with a single bite: sofrito. One has not experienced Puerto-Rican gastronomy, or excellent food in general, until they eat this heavenly meal.The cooking process sounds easy enough, yet even a slight miscalculation ruins the flavor. My great-aunt, Titi Mery, proudly professed to be the arroz-con-gandules-queen, and for sixteen years I observed her precise measurements and still remember her warning my mother to 'Chop one bunch of cilantro, not two!' or 'Cut that amount of salt, I don't want high blood pressure!' In the eyes of Titi, the delicious dish held a greater function than leaving an insatiable craving for a second helping. 'Arroz con gandules is more than some meal,' she would wisely state in her Boricuan accent. 'It reunites the whole family.'Those words formed into a mantra I recited under my breath with every slice and dice of the onion that caused my burning eyes to well with tears. My parents offered to host the annual family gathering at our house, and assuming such a role left us in charge of creating the cultural cuisine adored by my relatives. The paramount task of making arroz con gandules was regularly done by my great-aunt, but her sudden passing left a gap in both the cooking and social aspects among our family. Despite teaching the basics to her daughters, nieces, and a few Peruvian members from my father's side, no one dared to pursue the craft dominated by our beloved Titi. The dish, which meant everything to my aunt, would be absent at the most familial event of the year\u2013\u2013and I refused to let that happen.Far from a seasoned chef, I volunteered to honor my aunt's position, which led me boiling heaping quantities of rice and pigeon peas while chopping onions, sweet peppers, and a plethora of spices. It was hard to ignore the dubious looks thrown my way; it hurt when my grandmother scrutinized my cutting skills, raised an eyebrow, and simply handed me the recipe. Yet I threw the instructions away, for I memorized every step by heart\u2013\u2013and even if the results proved disastrous, I'd give my all to make Titi proud. For years I admired the strong women who expertly maneuvered through a crowded kitchen and calmly prepared several dishes. Now it was my time.After hours of preparation, the large pot containing the meal was shockingly empty within minutes of making it to the table, its unique aroma still wafting through the lively dining room air. As I sat alongside my family members\u2013sharing countless stories, debating over which La Liga soccer team was the best, eating and laughing until our stomachs ached\u2013the immense hole formed since my aunt's death began to shrink as Titi Mery's mantra came to fruition.I contentedly continue the job of making arroz con gandules at festivities, teach younger relatives the skill, and occasionally experiment with the recipe and incorporate Peruvian ingredients to add more spice in both taste and originality. Excitement now replaces any previous skepticism, and today, I can't imagine reunions without the classic dish on the table.Although I won't occupy the arroz-con-gandules-queen title for a while, there's no doubt Titi remains pleased that our favorite meal still performs its true purpose.""",,,

She turns the packet over and over with such intent I'm afraid it will break open.I place their coffees down and ask if they're ready to order. She nods and quietly points to the picture of oatmeal on the menu. She looks up expectantly at the man sitting across from her. 'Honey?' she breathes.'Yeah,' he mutters. 'I'll take the lumberjack special.' I reply in perkiest voice, 'Okay! I can take your menus for you.' They push them to the edge of the table, looking back at me with strained smiles. I assume they're a couple, both young and attractive and looking utterly miserable. But with coffees to refill and tables to bus, I don't have time to give it much thought.I dart from table to table before I see the cook poke his head out of the kitchen and signal that my order is up. I make my way through the bustling restaurant back to their table. A tense hostility emanates from the booth; I feel a deep uneasiness. 'Alright, I have the oatmeal and the lumberjack special for you,' I say, suddenly self-conscious of my voice. As I place the eggs down, the man rises. He mumbles something about how he just can't do this anymore and says 'I'm sorry' just a little too loudly and a little too forcefully for it to be believable. His sneakers squeak against the floor as he walks away. The girl remains seated in front of me, the sugar packet now clenched in her fist. I recognize her. I've never met her before, but I know I have seen her face. I've seen it on my friends, on my mom, and in the mirror. It is a face of heartbreak and defeat. Although we are both here in this diner, we are occupying separate universes, and hers has fallen apart. I want to embrace her before I remember that I do not know this woman; we are just strangers witnessing a deeply private moment play out in public. She fumbles with her wallet and pulls out a few bills. 'I hope this is enough.' She grabs her purse and takes a determined breath. I thank her, stopping myself before adding 'Have a good day.' Words feel out of place, so I attempt to express everything in a smile. I collect the plates of untouched food and the unopened sugar packet and bring them to the trash. I've seen a thousand people pass through the restaurant, but whenever I picture this booth, I see this couple sitting there. They stand out to me because, as I witnessed their private heartbreak, I became acutely aware of my own role as a stranger. Every day, the bikers, cosplayers, and yoga moms who have occupied this table enter the restaurant with lives as complex and dynamic as mine or yours. They are complete humans with their own stories that spread beneath them like the roots of a tree. Whether it be as waitresses or runners at crosswalks or travelers passing through arrival gates, we've all made a fleeting appearance in an untold number of these tales. Among this mass of unfinished stories, I am a stranger swept up in this blur of humanity. By the time I return to the dining room, a family is clamoring into the booth. While I take their order, I watch the toddler kneeling on his seat, amusing himself with a sugar packet clutched in his tiny palm.",,,
127,Admitsee,4,,,,,5,6,"A bit of sunlight streams through a partially covered window, revealing just how empty the bookshelves have become. The mahogany seems smaller, faker than when I was younger. What was once a large collection of children's books has dwindled to no more than a dozen. I close my eyes and picture my childhood self in this library: bright eyes, knee socks, arms shaking under the weight of one book too many. But that girl is gone, and as the library approaches closing time, I am still here, standing in the now-empty family room alone.I don't remember the first time I read Matilda, but my connection with the story, about a kid who made a home out of overflowing bookshelves and endless questions, was unsurprising. As a child, I didn't just identify with the girl with a red ribbon in her hair, simultaneously engaged in and dismissed by the world\u2014I was her. Like Matilda, I thought I was limitless: with my arms outstretched, I balanced four library books on my head, twirling until I collided with a bookshelf. Yet I was also her as I ached to know more, to read every story in the universe and then some. When reality beckoned, the sound of Matilda's wagon of books against concrete never failed to call me home.Back then, I was fascinated by the paradoxes of the library. If I forgot to return a book, would the librarian come into my room in the middle of the night to take it from me? Why were librarians given the power to speak, but the patrons had to remain quiet? And if we did make noise, why was it okay to break the silence when someone sneezed, but not when they coughed?After turning to her for answers, the librarian brought me a book on the common cold, opening to a picture of nasal anatomy. The nerves were fleshy pink and bulbous. 'But what's so special about a sneeze?' I implored. 'What does this mean?'She paused for an instant. 'Some people say that when you sneeze, your heart stops. They say \\\u2018bless you' so your soul doesn't leave your body.' 'All over a sneeze?' I whispered. 'Weird.'As I got older, my questions expanded from sneezes and coughs to curiosity about a world that seemed increasingly complicated and foreign. When the simplicity of our childhood faded, my friends and I sought explanations through writing, then tossed our melodramatic poems into frustrated, forgotten piles, all in an attempt to find clarity.I still struggle with things left uncertain, but, over time, I've begun to accept that some questions defy simple answers. Overwhelmed by all I didn't know, I learned how to craft worlds of comfort through my stories. I have come to understand that nobody can explain everything\u2014we all need a Miss Honey sometimes, someone to guide us like the kind soul who first helps Matilda find her own voice.In my childhood library, the lights flicker as though the electricity may cut off at any second. I trace my fingers over the edges of the bookshelves. They still feel familiar, predictable to the touch. Children don't come here anymore, the librarian explains, at least not how I once did. I disagree. There are few chairs occupied, but a family sits in the children's section, books resting on the table's yellow surface.Matilda has been checked out. The librarian offers to put it on hold for me, but I decline. I am still learning how to write, question and live, just as I yearned to at age seven, but another girl needs that book today. And if we were to meet, I'd say that I've been to the future and it needs girls like her: girls who demand answers, who will stop at nothing to know everything. Somewhere, she is sitting with a red ribbon in her hair, waiting to be seen.""},{""index"":1,""personal_essay"":""Words matter in the artistic sense, in the civic sense, and in the intimate conversations shared with those closest to us. Yet language's evolution is inherently political: throughout history, it has been used as a tool of power, enfranchising and disenfranchising millions. In Peru, for instance, most reporting is done in Spanish, not native Quechua. Though the media's rejection of this aboriginal language is subtle, it is nevertheless an attempt to erase the indigenous people's identities. Language carries both the incredible potential to evoke empathy among strangers and a complicated historical past, and exploring where these interpretations intersect fascinates me.",,,

130,Admitsee,3,1,,,,5,,"A director's vision is their definition and implementation of what they believe a production should look, sound, and feel like, and it should be treated with the utmost respect by the cast and crew. This is especially true for stage managers like myself; directors place complete faith in us to ensure that their vision is maintained once a show reaches its performance phase. In this essay, I will describe the time I threw my director's theatrical vision right out the window.On top of maintaining my director's vision through performances, I'm also tasked with ensuring that each show runs smoothly; both of these duties sat at the forefront of my mind as I watched hundreds of people, most of them children, pour into the auditorium to see my school's musical, Peter Pan. From backstage, I instructed the crew members in the booth at the back of the auditorium and my assistant stage manager on the other side of the stage to begin the final preparations for that afternoon's performance, using a headset to communicate with them all at once. A brief sound check yielded no issues, and the lights were in working condition. It was time for the show to begin.An important part of my director's vision for Peter Pan was to use projections to depict various scenes, including the sequence where Peter Pan teaches the main characters how to 'fly'. One student was kind enough to create a video of the actors flying around in the night sky on the way to Neverland, and it perfectly captured the magic of the scene. My director loved it. I was faced with a tough decision when, minutes into the show, the first video (not the flying one, thankfully) abruptly shut down halfway through, prompting me to ask the projectionist what had gone wrong. He informed me that the projector had accidentally been left on overnight from the previous performance, potentially damaging it. The projector worked fine during the short tests we did earlier that day, but we realized it wouldn't be able to function for longer periods of time. The actors played off the first malfunction well, but the pivotal flying scene was mere moments away. I could either risk projecting the video as planned or find a suitable alternative that would still make every child in the audience believe they could fly, sacrificing my director's vision in the process. After a few seconds of deliberation, I made my decision known over the roar of the show's music and the three panicked voices on the headset. I gathered the actresses playing fairies and instructed them to take the massive cloud meant for later in the show, and bring it with them in front of the curtain as they sang the next song. Meanwhile, I had my assistant stage manager direct the main actors to go directly in front of the curtain as well, then skip in circles around the cloud, singing about how they could fly. Every single one of them trusted my judgment about what would be best for that show, knowing that everything I suggested flew right in the face of what my director envisioned. Ultimately, my plan succeeded, and as the actors were singing and 'flying' through the skies, the little kids in the audience cheered, none the wiser about the video that had gone MIA. Initially, my director was furious and chewed me out during intermission, but after I explained the situation and she saw how enamored the children were after the show, even she agreed that I'd made the right choice to keep the show running smoothly.I wouldn't be the person I am today if it weren't for the Hutto High School Theatre Department. I was blessed to work alongside a group of people who supported me and me to become a better person, with greater confidence in myself and more joy in my life. They are the people who truly raised me, a community of individuals who were brought together by their love of theatre. To me, there is one experience that best represents the kind of lessons I've learned from them. As a freshman, I was timid and unhappy. I didn't ever really talk to people outside a small group of friends and I rarely spoke up in class, believing that I didn't have any worthwhile opinions to express. I didn't really have anything I was involved in or a community that I devoted much time to: at the end of every school day, I simply went home, and generally had an unexciting existence. I thought of high school as four more years of suffering that were necessary for me to find enjoyment in college and beyond. My choice to take technical theatre my freshman year was the key to changing all that. As part of the course, I had to work a certain amount of hours after school every term. I fulfilled mine by working the assistant stage manager for the fall show, Arsenic and Old Lace, and initially I was the only one in class interested in stage managing at all, I insisted that another student be found to work above me, fearful of my inexperience. Even back then I was an organized and detail-oriented though, so I figured I'd have at least some success with the meticulous work required of me in the role. Bert Keefer, an actor and senior in the department, helped me find the confidence in myself to do so much more. Throughout the rehearsal process, he would constantly test my nerve by breaking the rules of rehearsal. One time, I caught him mockingly eating a box of chocolates on stage, after I had already politely reminded him of the rules. He smirked at me, silently challenging me, and I knew what I had to do. I yanked the box out of his hands and threw them away, scolding him with a sterner tone of voice than I had ever used before as I did so. Bert said he was proud of me for that, and from then on, no one brought food on stage. Bert challenged me to stand up for myself in a way I had never been able to before, and that marked the beginning of me finding the inner strength to take firm stances on my opinions in the department, in class, and in life without issue. I feel much more comfortable contributing to class discussions and exchanging ideas with my peers than I'd ever had before. At the risk of sounding power hungry, I have to admit that I did enjoy that moment, and so many other moments from that production and all the ones that came after. Before theatre, I was so focused on achieving my goals in college and beyond that I never really stopped and tried to enjoy the present moment. In theatre though, and especially as a stage manager, the present is impossible to ignore, every rehearsal, performance, and competition has taught me that, and there's no way I would have survived if I hadn't learned to find joy in each moment. Being in theatre has changed my outlook on life and the future, and now even the small daily victories are worth celebrating.Volunteering is an outlet for me to do what I'm passionate about while making a positive impact on my community at the same time.",,,
131,Admitsee,3,1,,,,5,,"It's Pi Day, Pi Day, gotta do math on Pi Day!' My voice cracked on the last note as my seventh-grade classmates stared in horror. The karaoke track to Rebecca Black's 'Friday' blared in the background, but I couldn't stay on pitch. In a desperate attempt to win back my audience, I ran to the front of the stage like a pop star and encouraged everyone to clap along. Instead, I was met with boos and a few obscene gestures.A week earlier, my chorus teacher asked for a volunteer to write and sing a parody for our school's annual March 14th mathematics celebration. My hand immediately shot up. I loved being on stage and showing off my musical talent.The problem with my talent, though, was that I didn't have much.From the moment I could talk, I sang. I sang in school hallways. I sang in public restrooms. I sang in restaurants. I sang in doctors' offices. If someone mentioned a lyric in conversation, I would screech the tune. Adults thought it was charming, at least when I was young. Maybe they thought my voice would improve, or that I would give up when I realized how off-key I was.Neither happened. I kept singing \u2013 loudly - everywhere I went. My teachers gently suggested that I should focus on my academic talents, and classmates not-so-gently ordered me to shut up when they heard yet another rendition of 'You Belong With Me' drifting through the halls. I didn't care. Singing made me happy, and no one could make me stop.Early in freshman year, one week after a cappella auditions, I sprinted to the chorus room to see if my name was posted on the door. I scanned the list of groups, knowing my name would be at the top. It wasn't. It wasn't second. It wasn't third. In fact, it wasn't anywhere on the list. I walked away, shattered. I had believed that if I just cared enough about singing, my dreams would come true. I was wrong.The next morning, I Googled 'how to sing.' After a moment's thought, I edited my search to 'how to sing well.' I clicked the first YouTube video that appeared, took notes, and moved on to the next. And the next. And the next. When I finally stopped, it was dark outside.I started a regimen. I sat at my piano for hours, playing a single note over and over again to practice matching pitch. I stared at my mouth in the mirror and formed vowel sounds. I sang vocal warm ups in school hallways instead of belting 'I Will Always Love You' (to my peers' relief). For the first time, I started to understand that passion means nothing without hard work to support it.A year later, I waited with a dozen strangers in the chorus room. An unfamiliar man flung the door open and strode in. 'Welcome to the Highlands Belles,' he said with passion. 'This is going to change your lives.'It did. A cappella taught me the power of sisterhood when those twelve strangers became my best friends. When life tried to drown me, a cappella became my raft. I discovered how music can make a difference when I sang about bullying and stared into the eyes of a crying girl in the audience. Perhaps most importantly, I learned to walk the fine line between blindly following my passion and collapsing under the weight of criticism. Today, I take what is useful from the criticism and let go of the rest. My hard work has finally paid off \u2014 when I step on stage and find my happy place, I now hear cheers.",,,
132,Admitsee,2.5,,,,,,6,"There is something about that look I yearn for: eyes widening, the whole body shifts back momentarily before hunching over the paper, and the pencil begins scratching with new understanding. As long as I can remember, I've been the 'smart' kid in my groups of friends. Need help with math? Go see Mertz; he can help you!Nothing matches the feeling of providing help for a friend, or even a stranger. Perhaps it's because I've grown up with an engineering mindset from my family, and see problems as situations needing solutions. Assisting someone to resolve his or her misunderstanding provides me a sense of purpose.Throughout my adolescence, however, I've grown to see informal tutoring as more than an exclusively academic activity. I have bonded with some of my best friends by helping them with schoolwork. The setting of tutoring is so simple\u2014a quiet space with few distractions\u2014making it ideal for building strong friendships. Having a thoughtful conversation is rare nowadays, as many relationships are superficial and consist of gossip or sharing funny videos on Instagram. Contrary to a party, providing support offers a source of meaningful connection and helps reveal true character. I can see quickly who wants to spend the time learning, and who simply wants me to do the problem for them.This summer at pre-season football camp, one of my teammates was taking a summer Pre-Calculus course and he needed help with his homework; I had been friends with him since freshman year. School isn't his first priority, but he is a gifted athlete who wants to play in college. When he called me into his room at 11 PM, I was worried. Each day began with a 7 AM practice, and I almost wished I could do the work for him; I needed to get to bed. He insisted, however, on learning the material, and gradually my mood improved. By 1 AM, the work was done, the concepts were understood, and I had a whole new relationship and respect for my friend.Tutoring has also opened my mind up to new perspectives and ways of learning. I'm an auditory learner, and I can easily absorb information through a lecture. That is how I used to help people: simply memorize what the teacher said and spew it to whomever needed to listen. If my classmates didn't understand, 'rinse and repeat.' During the summer between my sophomore and junior years, I tutored students in math and chemistry through Cranbrook's Horizons Upward Bound program three times a week. After trying to explain combinations and permutations to one boy for almost fifteen minutes, I had an epiphany. If simply explaining something was the best way to get my point across, the kid would have already understood the concept in class. With this new realization, I cut up some paper and drew different shapes on each piece. Five minutes later, I saw that look I desired. The rest of the week, I saw him pull out theshapes whenever he had a problem to do, and he even started to show his friends how to use his technique.On the surface, tutoring can seem simple: sharing knowledge with others both sounds and can be basic. However, the brain is possibly the most complex object that exists; spending time connecting with each individual and finding out what makes his or her mind tick is when I can create substantial relationships and appreciate differing perspectives. Perhaps through my participation in team sports, where I have never been the superstar, I know the value in everyone's effort. I then take this insight and apply it to the scholastic setting, where I enjoy collaborating and recognizing the worth of everyone's opinion. Some people lead best through inspirational words and messages, commanding attention from a vast group of people, but I've found my value in helping others thrive through providing quiet support.",,,

I finally did it; I wore my afro to school!February 2009:'Gabby, what's it like to be black?' my third grade English teacher asked.It was February: Black History Month. I had just finished my PowerPoint on Alicia Keys' success when my teacher asked me this awkward question. With their straight hair and light skin, my classmates looked at me, eagerly waiting for my response.'Uh, I don't know,' I laughed.Standing out was something I alwaystried to avoid in Miami. Attending a predominantly Jewish school, I strived to fit in with the majority. When Ms. Cohen asked me that question, I didn't know, and quite frankly, did not want to know what it meant to be an African-American.December 2012:As seventh grade approached and my family moved from Florida to New York, I realized that I was hesitant to embrace my 'blackness' when I found myself, once again, in a predominantly white school. However, I soon realized that to attain a better sense of self, I needed to define who I was.March 2015:My determination to discover what being black meant to me turned the typical car-ride-home conversations into mini-black history lessons. As my mom informed me about prominent African-Americans such as Madam C.J. Walker, I couldn't help but feel proud. Given the lack of useful hair products for black women, Walker had the courage to address and meet a need. Learning about her not only gave me great hair care tips, but it also taught me how to make opportunities for myself and others. This newfound appreciation for historical figures translated to an increased self-confidence about my ethnicity.January 2016:I further acquired knowledge from meaningful documentaries. Through Ava DuVernay's film, 13th. I learned about the systematic injustices that remain in today's mass incarceration. My respect for African-American history and the endurance of black people encouraged me to move forward with pride and hope.June 2017:One day after school, my friend, Layla, told me how she loved my hair. In fact, she had hair just like mine. She immediately took out her phone to show me a picture.'Are you sure?' I asked surprised.'Of course!' She smiled.When she opened the picture, I was amazed to see that her hair was indeed similar to mine: tight curls and a coarse texture. As she told me how she admired me wearing my natural hair, I explained to her how I respected her determination to wear her hijab. Though Layla and I are of different ethnicities and religions, we both understood how hair, whether covered or uncovered, meant more than mere follicles. Wearing my natural hair symbolized an acceptance of both my cultural and personal identity.As I look back, I realize that this is a lifelong journey. The third grader who was once afraid to stand out ceases to exist, as I am proud of each self-discovery I make.",,,

As I looked up from the novel, I saw kids talking to their parents and yelling with their friends. I could not escape the nagging truth: I was an anomaly - not like the children in the room nor those in the novel clutched in my callous hands.Upon hearing the secretary call my name, I entered the examination room with optimism. However, rounds of doctors shoved tongue depressors down my throat, nurses forced clamped jaws open, and counselors used sweets as weapons of coercion, shattering my buoyancy. As the speech pathologist entered, I braced myself for further prying. To my surprise, I was met with a gentle, 'Hello.'Despite the kind gesture, the words felt like daggers piercing my soul. My heart beat out of my chest as my mind searched for a response. My pulse rang in my ears and the pressure spread through my body. Even after thinking up a response, my stomach cramped and my mouth refused to budge. At this point, my parents were pulled aside to discuss alternative solutions.From that day onward, group speech therapy took the place of my lunch period. The idea of trading PB&Js; for staring at others in silence seemed impractical, after all I tried every therapy under the sun and nothing yielded success. What would make this different? Nonetheless, I entered the speech counselor's office and took a seat alongside two other students.Our first task was to introduce ourselves. Initially, we made efforts to say our names, with varying levels of success. Ultimately, we realized that a nonverbal approach would be more efficient, so we each wrote our names on a sheet of paper and shared it.From nonverbal communication we moved on to gesturing, mouthing, eye contact, and producing sound, forging the path towards vocalization. Within three weeks, I had my first interaction with my teachers. In the span of two months, I was having brief conversations with my classmates. Our final assignment for group therapy was to introduce ourselves (this time with words), a reflection of the progress we had made.There was one more hurdle to pass: developing my voice - in all the time I was silent, I never thought about what I would do with my newfound voice. I feared that if I didn't use it, someone would use it for me.While I dipped my toes into different outlets, my parents and peers pushed me to deliver a speeches or sing in school concerts. Regardless of the intent, others were seizing my voice and suppressing the person behind it - the very thing I feared. Not knowing what to do, I chose to use my voice to lead, so I took the first steps and directed a class discussion.From class discussions, I moved on to group projects and clubs in high school. Today, I am 40% diligent student, 40% teenage angst, and 30% silent child of the past - giving 110% every step of the way. My dreams range from becoming Secretary of Energy to the head doctor of a medical practice. Some may call these ambitions far-fetched; however, with every leadership role I take, I know I am one step closer. After all, I've overcome adversity my whole life, just ask my therapist.",,,
138,Admitsee,3,,,,,5,6,"2012 MATHCOUNTS SPRINT ROUND. As I stared at my first MathCounts practice test, my seventh grade mind begged for more sleep. After plowing through thirty monotonous quadratic factorizations assigned as algebra homework the previous night, I dreaded more math, let alone waking up at 6:30 for a MathCounts practice. Little did I know, this forty minute contest math test would spark a passion in mathematics that would change my life.Contest math questions were unique because the solutions were simple to comprehend, but extremely difficult to produce. To solve the problems, I needed a deep, intuitive understanding of many math topics because the solutions applied basic formulas and concepts in clever and inventive ways. I thoroughly enjoyed this, as it forced me to problem solve. Unlike many school tests in which I could quickly confirm I could answer all the questions, I knew I wouldn't be able to answer many problems on a contest math test. The joy in taking these tests came from the analytical process and mystery of the outcome, as it was more engaging to work on a problem I knew I might not solve. To begin these problems, I would first notice patterns, test smaller versions, and brainstorm possible solutions.Many of my approaches failed, but some inspired other approaches, which sometimes led to a solution. When I conquered these questions, I felt powerful, because I had logically thought through a demanding problem. Even when I failed to decipher the problem, I was enlightened by the innovative solutions. I tried to grasp the motivations behind each step, and give myself a more rigorous understanding of the topic.Although contest math has pushed me to extensively study mathematics independently, I believe that the greatest growth and learning comes when collaborating with fellow passionate students. However, in my hometown of Marion, Iowa, the most popular interests are Hawkeye football, Cyclone football, and high school football. There are only a few students that I can discuss problems with and spur on each other's enthusiasm for mathematics.To further my interest in mathematics and work with talented students from around the country, I attended the AwesomeMath summer camp at UT Dallas after my sophomore year. During AwesomeMath, I learned more about mathematics than I ever could have imagined, with topics ranging from excircles to diophantine equations. More importantly, I loved that my growth was largely attributed to collaboration with my fellow classmates. Because almost all of the problems interweaved multiple subfields of mathematics, we cooperatively solved many complex math problems, with each of us bringing our unique natural strength to the problem. Alex from Canada was the geometry guru, Anna from Florida was the trig tyrant, Steven from Utah was the algebra eXpert, and I was the combinatorics king. Through our teamwork, we conquered a myriad of problems that we could probably never solve alone. In addition, we became better problem solvers by explaining to each other clever motivations contained in our mathematical strength.Furthermore, mathematics led to friendships outside the classroom. Although discussing problem fourteen on the 2008 AIME is not typical 'small talk', our common interest in mathematics led us to converse about our shared hobbies such as chess, tennis, and Fun Run. As time went on, our shared passion for mathematics and mutual interests led to extremely strong friendships. Even today, I still discuss mathematics and converse with many of the friends I met at math camp.Contest mathematics made me realize that there's much more to mathematics than what I've encountered in most high school classrooms, requiring rote memorization and numerous calculations. Furthermore, the creativity of contest math problems and solutions allowed me to go beyond the classroom and energized me to be truly passionate about mathematics. Lastly, collaborating on mathematics with fellow devoted students nationwide has allowed me to absorb more information than I ever could alone, and above all, has produced lasting friendships.",,,
139,Admitsee,3.5,,,,,5,,"My stomach painfully twists as I sit in the van driving back from my mission trip to Eagle Pass. This has happened to me before. It won't last more than a week. The next two and half weeks proved me wrong. The pain intensified as the days passed, and every time I tried to eat, it made me more aware of the pain. 'Pierce, we need to go to the hospital.' Before I knew it, I was in a hospital bed with an IV in my arm. My vision faded and I woke up several hours later. 'After reviewing the test results, it is clear that you have Crohn's Disease.' My heart dropped.Both my parents suspected that I had an inflammatory bowel problem. I had done my research and I knew there was no cure for Crohn's. I thought that my week could not get any worse.Three days later I received a call from my father telling me that I needed to accompany him to the hospital. My grandmother, who had been battling illnesses for months, was going to die. She had moved to Houston shortly before I was born to be closer to my mother. As we stood with her in the cold hospital room, memories of the times when she would pick me up from school came flooding back. She was a retired teacher and routinely helped me with my homework and sparked my interest in science. She died later that night.My diagnosis and the loss of my grandmother could not have come at a more challenging time during my junior year. I was a member of the first Strake Jesuit Public Forum Debate team to attend the national Tournament of Champions (TOC), and AP exams would be taking place in just over a month. I missed about two weeks of school during my Crohn's flare-up, so I was swamped with makeup work.Everyone faces obstacles, and I told myself that while my disease and circumstances may have left me weak, I wouldn't give up. I knew I could be just as determined as my grandmother, who battled illnesses, countless broken bones, and underwent more surgeries than I can remember. I put all my energy into recovery and my determination and hard work paid off. My debate partner and I finished the TOC with a positive record, I scored 19\/20 on my combined AP exams, and I maintained straight A's in all my courses. After eight months, I no longer have pain and can manage my disease with medication. Moreover, I am confident that I can overcome difficult obstacles and help others do the same.I always wanted to be a doctor but never saw myself as a patient. My experience has been edifying. After seeing many different doctors and having a multitude of tests, I saw the complexity of our health care system and appreciate the need for simplicity and coordination as a care provider. I think that doctors need to see beyond the specific disease and understand the other issues that are happening with the patient. For me, I want to be more patient-centered and less disease-centered when I hopefully enter the world of medicine.I also developed a better understanding of the steep costs that come from medical care. While we could pay for my care, I realized that many families go bankrupt due to medical expenses. I founded a 501(c)(3) charity, the American Medical Debt Relief Foundation, and currently serve as President. My organization raises funds to forgive medical debt owed by people all over the country. Since inception, we have abolished about $3 million in medical debt, ensuring that these patients can focus on recovery and not repayment. I'm not happy that I have this illness, but I'm able to use it positively to be a better person and advocate.I spent the majority of my time after school, every weekend during the school year, and several weeks each summer debating. I chose debate because I wanted to further my academic interests beyond what I could learn in the classroom. It was important to me to learn more about what was going on in the world. The experience has been invaluable for several reasons. I learned how to handle defeat. During my freshman year, my partner and I competed on the varsity team and found that competing against seniors was very difficult. Despite this, we tried different strategies in rounds, had practice rounds against the seniors on our team almost every day, and just kept doing as much research as we could. That year, and the following two years, I was awarded the honor for the best public forum debater at Strake Jesuit. I have learned how to work collaboratively. Summers at debate camp gave me the opportunity to work with debaters from across the country with different backgrounds and experiences. I formed bonds with people over a common interest in the issues that face not only our nation, but the entire world. The lessons that I have taken from that novel cooperation and the friends that I made are still some of my most important memories. By sophomore year, my partner Daniel and I were serving as the captain of both varsity and junior varsity teams. We won our first tournament and qualified for the state championship. We kept up the hard work, spent another summer at debate camp in Boston, and junior year we qualified for the exclusive, national Tournament of Champions (the collection of the best teams in the US). Debate also gave me a chance to be a teacher. Now in our senior year, we have taken the Strake Jesuit Public Forum Team from a group that struggled to qualify members for the state tournament to a team that regularly receives several qualifying bids to the Tournament of Champions at every competition we attend. Daniel and I have come a long way since our freshman year and we are ranked 5th in the nation (as of 01\/09\/18).The skills central to success in debate: analyzing data, using it to create cogent arguments, being able to express myself clearly, and thinking on my feet are the same skills that will be central to my success in the future. These skills will facilitate my efforts to reduce disparities and inequities through medicine and policy.",,,
140,Admitsee,3.5,,,,,5,6,"People stared quizzically at me as I loitered around the batting cages with my breadboards, circuit wires, and a microcontroller. My eighth grade self didn't let their antagonistic looks deter me from achieving my goal of designing a baseball helmet safer than one of a billion dollar company. So, I decided to launch a 60 mile per hour fastball to test my haphazardly built prototype. The electrical devices testing the impact to the brain revealed nothing\u2026 The baseball destroyed all the equipment. This experiment revealed one important thing. No it's not that people shouldn't launch baseballs at fragile equipment (definitely true, though!), but that I needed a mentor if I wanted to conduct meaningful research relating to neurodegenerative disorders. Witnessing trauma injuries and the effects of Alzheimer's has motivated me from a young age to determine how we can protect the brain. Thus, months searching for possible computational biology internships and just plain praying yielded my dream job. I was finally employed as an image processing researcher at Brain Health Alliance, a nonprofit organization that develops software applications to combat Alzheimer's. Unlike cancer or other diseases that have made breakthroughs this century, Alzheimer's continues to ruthlessly tear apart the brains of millions of people. But before I could do actual research, I needed to develop my fundamentals. My mentor assigned me a 'warm-up' project of creating a computer interface displaying brain scans. I thought the task of converting brain data into images would be simple, but it turned into an arduous three week adventure with minefields at every step. My first attempt was a success, that is, if you consider looking at images with the same quality as your 1970s television a success. However, 160 hours of hard work later, I finally finished the project to an acceptable quality. A project already completed in Alzheimer's research. But one that taught me more about computer science than any of my classes and showed me why brain visualization is important in diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's. Now, two years later, I devote the majority of my free time to my work at Brain Health Alliance. I don't just tolerate the long twelve hour summer days or the late nights spent conducting research, I live for them. Even if my research has a 0.01% chance of leading to a breakthrough, I know the time I sacrificed will be well worth the reward for the millions of families suffering from Alzheimer's. My dogged persistence in contributing effectively to my image processing group, primarily made up of PhD students and college undergraduates, pushes me to carve my own research identity by spending hours writing code, creating novel methods, and finding meaningful results.My scientific research in visualization can be divided into two areas: volume rendering and co-registration. Volume rendering is the process of viewing brain scans as 3D objects. I contributed to the first software application allowing users to view brain scans in commercial virtual reality devices, such as the Oculus Rift. This prototype software provides a more natural visualization when compared to standard techniques and can be used in surgical simulations. Co-registration, a medical procedure used in clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's, aligns different brain scans. I conducted multiple computational experiments comparing the accuracy of existing co-registration algorithms. Now, after being a first-author on three conference presentations and co-authoring two publications in these two fields of research, I lead a project, in which my three colleagues and I are developing an algorithm allowing physicians to simultaneously view the functional and structural attributes of a brain. This project isn't a cure.However, successful implementation could expedite diagnosis and research of Alzheimer's. More importantly, this project is the first opportunity for me to express my creativity in designing real world solutions. I've matured considerably from my baseball debacle. I now understand the necessity for mentors and teams to move an idea from conception to reality.",,,
141,Admitsee,3,1,,,,,,"Whiskey, Waffle House, and Jesus I stepped up to the podium, adjusted the microphone, and looked out. Thousands of judging eyes looked back. Okay, I thought, you only live once. Reserved for ceremonies and announcements, the McCallie School Chapel in Chattanooga, Tennessee was anything but controversial.'Hey, y'all. I'm starting a Young Socialists Club.'Silence. Despite countless debate tournaments, Model United Nations conferences, and oration contests, my confidence dwindled. I felt as though I'd been thrown overboard in a storm. No matter how I tried crawling back onto the deck of my boat, a never-ending series of towering waves kept slamming me back down to a pool of dark, foamy water and sucking me beneath the surface. I was just starting my speech about political diversity when I heard clapping. Then cheers. Soon, the entire student body was chanting: 'Trey! Trey! Trey!' Maybe I didn't live in Trumpland, after all; Donald's election was only a bad dream!Okay, that's not what happened. Instead, my announcement was met with cricket-chirping silence, followed by muffled laughter and boos. And instead of a firm handshake and way-to-take-initiative-son type comment, I was met with an eyebrow-furrowing frown. A teacher yanked me aside as I walked off stage. 'You had no right to do that, son,' he said.Similar scenes have characterized my life in the South. I've lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Lookout Mountain, Georgia, Norfolk, Virginia, and Fort Worth, Texas. From organizing a socialist club to spending senior year in 'job-stealing' China, my decisions have caused many eyes back home to roll.My relationship with the South has been complicated. Because my father is a vascular surgeon, his work and conference invitations enabled my family to travel inside and outside the United States. My mother also saved every dollar so she could show my brother, sister, and I the world. By freshman year, I had lived in thirteen houses, ranging from the banks of the Tennessee River to the cobblestone streets of Antwerp, Belgium. I had ridden trains across Western Europe, studied Mandarin and Chinese culture in Beijing, and done humanitarian work in rural Cuba. These experiences created a point of comparison that rendered me insecure of my Southern heritage.It's no secret that the South is the most uneducated part of America \u2013 nowhere else is football valued more than academics. Nowhere else do people attend snake-handling churches. Drive down the highway running through my hometown and you'll notice three billboards: the first advertises whiskey, the second Waffle House, and the third Jesus. (Another advertises Bradford Health Services, a drug and alcohol rehab facility, but we don't talk about that here.) I was raised in an environment where people laugh at stay-at-home dads. I was raised in an environment where the endowment of the all-boys high school is double that of the all-girls high school, and 'I'm With Her' signs are stolen from 'un-American' yards.I was confronted by the dilemma of my cultural identity: I could embrace it in the name of conformity, or jettison a connection I thought would limit my chances to succeed. I chose the latter; I skipped Friday night football games, researched colleges thousands of miles away, and even attempted losing my Southern accent.I now realize that my harsh judgment of Southern culture was unjustified, hypocritical, and divisive. In reality, problems exist within every society. People deserve respect regardless of their accent, heritage, or political stance. By neglecting the positive qualities of the South, such as its strong sense of individuality and family values, I embodied the very intolerance and closed-mindedness I criticized. Life in the South has taught me that meaningful change is achieved not through an all-or-nothing mentality, but through mutual respect, understanding, and compromise.I eventually renamed my organization the 'Young Progressives Club' to be more inclusive. Although it wasn't enough to convince any Trump supporters to join, they stopped booing my chapel announcements.",,,

144,Admitsee,3.5,1,2,,,,,"Did you not hear or did you not listen?' My partner's words echoed in my mind. In truth I did not listen. I thought I knew better. After all, it had been on my shoulders. I was the one who had to win the debate. It was my speech.When all was said and done, the choices were mine and the loss mine. Except that it was not only mine. My decision meant that my partner would end the last tournament of his debate career in failure. One of his last memories of debating with me would forever be tainted.Striding away from the room, away from the building, I walked into the arms of close friends. As I collapsed into a chair and contemplated the loss, they consoled me as I attempted to reflect on my mistakes.I still had to debate round seven.The thought of forcing myself to speak again paralyzed me. Would the very last round of my partner's senior year be a loss? Would it be my fault again?In that moment of questioning myself, I could barely muster up the strength to find the will to debate. Yet, surrounded by energetic debaters, I could not resist the temptation to compete again. As I found myself balancing on the cliff, ready to collapse, I discovered a newfound energy within myself. I thought about why I debate: the adrenaline, the critical thinking, the camaraderie. Then, the prospect of debating another round was no longer daunting.We won that round seven. Though it did not alter our ranking at the tournament enough, at least we ended our year on a high note. Choosing to debate in the final round instead of conceding was an emotionally taxing decision. Overcoming this challenge, not the prospect of winning another round, reinvigorated my spirit. As I debated beside my partner in our last round, I realized we relied on a community of individuals to support us.Every step of the way, my partner, coach, and friends supported me. After our fateful loss, I found the will to stand back up.As my community coalesced around me after our loss, I knew I was not alone. At any moment, I can ask for help and dozens of willing hands would come to my aid. In my folly, we lost because I felt in control and deliberately ignored my coach's advice. Yet, I chose to radically depart from the previous ideal of myself and, for once, accept the help of others.Despite letting down my partner, I decided to continue debating into my senior year. I felt a desire to give back to the community which had given me so much. By debating again, I could act as the stabilizing presence for friends and younger debaters. I could help them overcome the challenges I have faced, and we could face new ones together.I find joy by seeking challenges, experiencing the full range of what life can offer. Right now, I live through my debates. I confront each challenge head on and never back down, especially after a loss. Waking up the morning of a debate tournament and seeking new trials is where I am content. At the same time, I am happiest connecting with other people and finding the common humanity between us. I help others, as I was helped. Every opportunity we have to take a small step together, towards success and towards growth, is invaluable.This sense of community, of fidelity towards one another, is what I will seek to find as I move onto the new challenges life brings me. After this year, I will still have my friends from debate, but our common activity ends with high school. As I move forward, I will seek out new communities, new activities, and new commonalities to build networks of success, because I know that way, we can weather any storm.'Hey, what book should I read?'As the school's resident bibliophile, I am asked this question on a daily basis. I walk the hallways with a book in hand and people stop to ask. I feel myself breaking into a smile as I channel my inner Ollivander from Harry Potter. I shuffle around the collection of books that is my brain, looking for the perfect story to match each individual. As Ollivander measures Harry to find his wand, I too ask numerous questions about their interests. Eventually, I make a final choice, displaying my understanding of someone through a book.I was horrible at doling out book suggestions to my friends. I would consistently miss the target, not fully understanding what they wanted.Yet, I learned to improve. By constantly reading, I broadened my horizons. I began to appreciate the subtle differences between literature from different cultures and times. In turn, the quality of my suggestions improved dramatically. I could tailor a specific recommendation to my friend, lighting up their day as they delved happily into a new book. In my years of reading, I never would have thought that my love for literature would manifest like this. However, as I cultivate relationships with many different people, I appreciate the value of this unique talent. Recommending a book is profoundly intimate. I must understand a person and apply that to every book I have ever read. I must interrogate everything I know about this individual to break down their preferences, ultimately returning a singular answer. Even more, every book I recommend feels like a referendum on me. The act of recommending a book shares something deeply personal about me. By revealing my favorite books, I am subtly showing an often hidden side of myself to others. Their judgments of the book often have biting implications on their perceptions of me. This action creates a unique bond between two individuals and I relish every opportunity to use my expertise to share the joy of literature with others. As everyone got their wand from Ollivander, everyone gets their books from me.",,,

I had never swum a hundred (yards) free on a one-minute thirty interval before. I watch as everyone lines up before me, leaving me disappointedly and embarrassingly last in the lane. When I started swimming competitively, I naively assumed that becoming the fastest swimmer on the team would be easy because I was confident in my abilities. But after my first swim practice, I realized, as I died swimming the first lap of the set, that I, in fact, sucked. And that was just the warm-up.My ego was hurt. For those two hours, it didn't feel like I was swimming through water, but rather trudging through thick mud. But no matter how much I was like a cat in the water, I wanted to move my way up to Lane 8, the lane consisting of the fastest, most agile swimmers of the group.I'll admit it -- that first day of practice, I quit multiple times. As everyone else continued swimming, I leaned against the pool wall, desperately attempting to catch my breath. And for that, my coach, Brian, gave me some tough love.'Unless I see you black out, there's no excuse for you to stop swimming, no matter how hard the practice set is.'Is he serious?! I thought Brian would follow his statement with a light-hearted comment like, 'Not literally, but you know what I mean,' but he just continued to stare at me stoically. Wow...He was serious.With newfound determination, over the span of five years, five times each week, even with my parents' concerns over my management of time, I endlessly swam up and down the lanes of that 25-yard-pool, alternating between butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley sets, until it was impossible for my arms and my legs to move. Outside of the pool, Brian's comment echoed in my head, reshaping the dynamics of my life. I swapped a can of soda for a glass of water, a pathetic curl-up for a dignified plank, and a quitter's attitude for a winner's. When I had an extra hour, I would replay Michael Phelps' iconic 100 fly Olympic win on Youtube to study his exemplar dolphin kick and arm technique. Needing all the help I could get for my worst stroke (breaststroke), I watched and analyzed Rebecca Soni's world-record breaking 200 Breaststroke Gold-Medal moment in order to emulate her turned-out feet and quick arm pulls.One day at practice, I confidently placed myself in Lane 5.'Elaine,' called Brian. 'You're in the wrong lane,' he finished as he motioned towards Lane 7.My eyes widened. I hadn't anticipated those words. Though it may not seem like it, Brian had complimented me. I had been waiting for those five words for a long time. It was validation that I was on the right track. Just like my first practice, I watched as everyone lined up before me. But this time, I was contently last in the lane after swimming 2836 miles to get here. While I'm still advancing my skill set in Lane 7, I maintain my sights on the neighboring lane - the last lane to cross. Initially, swimming in Lane 1 was hard to accept, but someday, somewhere, I know I will be back in Lane 1 again, whether or not it's in the pool. When I started high school, my mentality was to get straight A's, perfect test scores, and a flawless GPA. Swimming brought me back to reality; I'm very aware that I'm not perfect and that I won't be number one at everything. Thanks to Brian's advice, though, I never passed out and I never again gave up. Rather, I continue to pursue challenging endeavors as I pave my way towards another Lane 8.'Twelve one-hundred freestyle on a one-minute thirty interval!' shouts my coach.I frantically swim to the back of Lane 1. I watch as everyone lines up before me, leaving me disappointedly and embarrassingly last in the lane. I'll admit it\u2014that first day of practice, I quit multiple times. As everyone else continued swimming, I leaned against the pool wall, attempting to catch my breath. And for that, my coach, Brian, gave me some tough love.'Unless I see you black out, there's no excuse for you to stop swimming.'As a result, over the span of five years, four or five times each week, even with my parents' concerns over my time management, I endlessly swam up and down the lanes of that 25-yard-pool, alternating between butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley sets, until it was impossible for my arms and my legs to move.

Even with years of arduous experience, I'm not the swimmer standing at the top of the podium. But in my eyes, with each day, I see improvement. It mirrors my time spent helping young kids learn how to swim at my local YMCA. These kids work to 'move up' their own lanes. As I watch as them lose their dependency on floaties, I reflect on my own journey from Lane 1 to Lane 7.",,,
147,Admitsee,3.5,1,2,,4,5,,"Wait, what! I was wondering why I ran into you all the time!'The sounds of shock, confusion, and astonishment emanated from the mouths of my cross country teammates. After almost three months of attending classes and running together every day, they suddenly found out my darkest secret. No, I did not possess the power of teleportation or Hermione Granger's time turner, but I had something even more powerful: an identical twin. I never tried to keep the existence of Lizzie a secret to anyone. In fact, I was a bit perplexed myself, as they all claimed they had never seen me walking by her side to school or sitting with her at lunch. Yet, I had been unknowingly concealing her identity from the people I spent two hours of practice with every day. Suddenly, my body flooded with shame. Amidst daily conversations and anecdotes about distant cousins and family pets, I never once mentioned her name. They had no knowledge whatsoever about this essential sphere of my life. How could I have failed to tell them about Lizzie? About my sister\u2014my twin sister\u2014my best friend?As I ruminate on my hiccup, I realize I was so ashamed that I never mentioned Lizzie because she plays such an integral role in my identity. Not because of our matching frizzy, blonde hair or our shared DNA\u2014our similarities are not what hold us together. In fact, the most potent force she brings to my life is the drive to recognize and develop my unique capabilities, even in the face of someone supposedly 'just like me.'When we were younger, Lizzie and I did everything together. As we grew up, I struggled to match her successes and began to loathe the semblance we shared. I moped with stringing, skinned knees as she rode past me on her bike with ease. I crawled into a messy top bunk every night as she tucked herself into the meticulously made bed beneath mine. She scored more goals than me in soccer and sight read music effortlessly in church choir while I still struggled to hold scissors properly. It was as though someone removed my faults and shortcomings and made a copy of myself that I could never live up to. I felt more like her shadow than her equal.After wallowing in self-pity and distress, sometime in my middle school years I realized that Lizzie seemed her happiest when she was playing lacrosse, a sport for which I possessed neither the desire or skill to play. Nevertheless, I longed to experience the passion she felt for something of my own. I wanted to practice my collaborative skills, indulge my hunger for competition, and experience the self-growth she was enjoying on her team. And that's when I found running. As I timidly walked into practice on my first day of freshman year, I felt lost and lonely without Lizzie by my side. Slowly, however, I gained confidence and ability in the sport. Every night, I excitedly updated my sister on my latest workouts and race times. Although the terms I babbled meant nothing to her, she matched my enthusiasm and spirit for my progress. Her unconditional support for me allowed me to realize the best version of myself.As I have aged, I have learned how to use our commonalities to compliment and support my individuality. While we aren't straight copies of one another, we do share things like our incredibly immature senses of humor and our voracious passions for waterskiing. The moments of time we spend together from walking down the street to buy dinner to traveling outside the country create inside jokes and poignant memories that I recall with fondness and sincerity every day. The common ground beneath us fosters the steadfastness of our relationship, creating a bond closer than any other I have experienced in my life. My experiences in high school have taught me that having a connection as close as that between Lizzie and me is essential for human growth and development. For every blunder I experience, I know that she is waiting attentively to catch me when I fall. For every misunderstanding and argument, I know there will be an absurd moment of screeching laughter as I lie on the floor of her room thirty minutes later. Her unwavering presence has brought me the comfort and encouragement I need to succeed in all parts of my life during the past four years. Being an identical twin has taught me to defy comparison and to use my sister as support and encouragement instead of constant competition. I know when it is best to be her collaborator, caretaker, or cheerleader, and she knows which role to play for me. I want her to succeed in her personal endeavors as much as she wants me to thrive in my own\u2014it is this element of reciprocity in our relationship that allows it to play such a fundamental role in my life.This year, as I met the newcomers to my cross country team, the first thing I told them was, 'I'm an identical twin.' Not because I wanted to spare them of awkward encounters of confusion in the hallway, but because I wanted them to know the most important thing about me.",,,

149,Admitsee,3.5,,,,,5,,"Childhood ShadowEveryone's childhood tends to combine into streams of blurry memories. I am no different. Through the haziness however, there is one clear memory I have of the first time I truly took interest in something around me. Like other children my age I had fallen into the habit of questioning everything around me, being merciless to my parents, asking whatever questions came to mind. I stood in my front yard, no more than four years old standing at about three and a half feet. Being an only child at the time, I could often cajole my parents into playing whatever game I had my mind set one. That day's choice: tag. The day remained bright and hot but I paid it no mind, too excited that I was going to play my favorite game. As the game preceded nothing out of the ordinary took place, my parents were discreetly letting me win and I was obliviously thinking I had the speed of a superhero, too fast for my parents to catch. It was halfway through the game that I started noticing something strange. I was being followed and whatever was following me was copying everything I did. My curiosity was peeked, so naturally I decided to investigate, unconsciously doing a four year olds version of the scientific method. I began by running around and testing the figure, seeing if it would follow. It did. Then I jumped around, seeing if the thing would jump. It did. At this point my parents noticed what I was doing and just stared at me befuddled. My brain was going haywire with this information, assessing if the situation would bring danger. Soon the emotions of confusion and frustration overwhelmed me; I started crying, running to my parents and asking why the figure wouldn't leave me alone. My parents soothingly informed me of what a shadow was and why I should not be afraid of it. Flash forward twelve years later and this story is inevitably still mentioned to me at least once every year during family gatherings. It serves as a memory of unique childlike curiosity and hilarity to my family. Why did this particular moment stick with me out of all the memories I had of my childhood? In retrospect, nothing special truly happened that should have made the memory follow me. However, that was the first time I had truly questioned and investigated something of interest to me. I took the lead of an investigation and proved that I could take the steps to find a solution, even if my parents had to give away the answer. It was a lesson that I would recognize in later years. There is no one even that transforms a person into an adult; adulthood is a collection of lessons and experiences that evolve a person. This one moment of my life marked my first shallow steps into adulthood.My family has always labeled me as headstrong. There is little doubt that this is a result of being surrounded by the women in my family who are each powerful in their own right. My aunt showed me what being independent meant. My sisters aided me in developing unending patience through moments of frustration. Finally, my mom was the one who taught me how to love through the difficult times. Gone are the days when I was afraid to talk to strangers, choosing instead to hide behind my mom's legs. I have learned to take the initiative in situations and become powerful in my own right. With the events surrounding this year I now hold true to my beliefs. Racism, intolerance, women's rights, and hate crimes are the problems that so many people are facing on a day-to-day basis. It is because of this that I am no longer afraid to speak my mind solely because issues are labeled as 'controversial' or because they may make people uncomfortable. My strength is not solely reliant on my academic standing. I have become aware of the problems that surround us all today and am ready to use my voice in a positive matter to raise awareness, inform, and make a change.Growing up as an only child for six years, I was often the focus of my parents' attention. I learned to hone the skill of negotiating for this very reason. I was the experimental child so to speak, meaning that my parents were, and still are, the sternest with me. I learned from a young age, around the time I was starting school, to negotiate with them to attain something I desired. Then, my parents were the ones negotiating, often bribing me with toys or dollar bills for straight A's or perfect grades on spelling tests. The positive reinforcement continued until I arrived at middle school; this was when I recognized I could often negotiate my own terms in order to be allowed out with my friends. The best result was that I grew up wanting outstanding grades, which meant receiving what I asked for came easily. As I continued to mature, the foundation stayed the same but the outcomes changed. My greatest negotiation occurred while I was in eighth grade preparing to enter high school. I resolved to finish high school with excellent grades, graduate in the top twenty percent of my class, and attend a university. In return, my aunt promised me a trip to Europe following my graduation. Now, four years later, my aunt is preparing to buy a travel package to three different countries for the last week of May. Negotiations are a part of everyday life, whether we realize it or not; being able to make my own negotiations has led to extraordinary outcomes.Educational opportunities present themselves in different forms. When combined, they allow me to enhance what was originally presented. My school, Xavier College Preparatory, aims to prepare students for universities by providing individuals with the tools necessary for success. The electives Xavier offers allow me to explore interests outside of my collegiate focus. Over the years I have taken classes such as: Criminal Law, Sociology, Astronomy, and AP Psychology. These classes have provided me with exploring different options, and, as a result, introduced me to the idea of double majoring with Psychology due to my enjoyment and passion for the class. Electives introduced me to different types of classes such as Sociology, which requires discussion based thought processes. Besides the electives offered, Xavier encouraged me in furthering my science and mathematical abilities. I entered high school taking Geometry the summer before ninth grade, and will end my high school career with Multivariate Calculus. Additionally, summer school classes helped me to advance in science where I completed the three core science prerequisites, which permitted me to enroll in Anatomy\/Physiology. The opportunities Xavier offered accumulated, enhancing not only my academic progress, but helping me explore my own interests outside of STEM classes, thereby reinforcing my interest in math, science, and social sciences.Humans are some of the most fascinating creatures to ever roam Earth: Thoughts, emotions, and passions drive our actions. To study the human mind and its functions is to study the person. For this reason, AP Psychology has rapidly become the subject towards which I am most inclined. Initially, I took psychology because of my interest in neuroscience. This class was the closest opportunity to an in depth study of the nervous system, even if the course focused on the mind. The unit on neural processing first piqued my interest in psychology as a possible major alongside neuroscience. After studying units on cognition, memory, sensation and perception, and biology I realized the deep passion I had for studying the mind.My original intention was to attend college majoring in a physical science, like biology, if neuroscience were not offered. However, because I took this class I am now considering majoring in Neuroscience and Psychology, if possible. I have always had an interest in the brain; my curiosity stemmed from watching shows like House that would offer in depth explanations of rare cases. These explanations with the accompanying images of the disease and its effect on the body drew me to medicine. The brain, the true powerhouse of the body, lured me to neuroscience. Through this journey I developed a fascination for the functions of the nervous system and the mind. How the nervous system and mind work together and the effects they cause are what I am interested in studying throughout my college career; to think, it all started when I signed up to take AP Psychology.",,,
150,Admitsee,3,,,,,,6,"Throughout the course of working on my IA, I have acquired a multitude of knowledge I lacked previously. My question, to what extent did the Black Plague influence animosity towards the Catholic Church, limited me to a few authors from the time period. While attempting to find primary sources, I realized one of the obstacles historians face. I imagine that the further back in time the topic is, the harder it is to find primary sources. As opposed to classmates who researched more recent topics, I could not interview or find many interview of people from the time period. In addition, the time period I chose to research was the beginning of when writing about historical incidents became prevalent. Finding a primary source was difficult because many people were preoccupied with the plague and worried about their health. The primary source I found was a Renaissance humanist writer; therefore, he is free to interpret the event as he sees fit. This comes to question the validity of primary sources if one is fortunate enough to locate it. Finding a primary source that has adequate reliability is a challenge since many individuals in the time period were uneducated and would be unable to efficiently describe the happenings of the time. Not only may the primary sources have limited education, they may have a biased perspective, forcing the historian to interpret the usefulness of the source. This was especially key to my research, since many of the people who would have been writing about the happenings of the time, would have resented the Church.Another difficulty I encountered when researching was the credibility of websites with information on the Black Plague. Many websites offered a basic overview of the events that occurred, not an in-depth analysis. They gave facts to help one understand the general happenings of the Black Plague, but did not delve further into what happened. Information that was 'deeper than the surface' was difficult to locate due to the lack of records at the time. Many governments stopped keeping records shortly before the plague; therefore, limiting the sources historians could access. This is coincidental because the plague was predicted by the people in the time period. This makes me understand how hard it is for historians to uncover records from history. The time period that I chose to research was a large factor in the difficulty to find information since humans in general were less intelligent, organized, and not concerned with the future. This IA made me realize some of the obstacles historians face, especially when researching history with little detailed information.",,,
151,Admitsee,3.5,1,,,,,,"The crowd erupted as Charles Ar\u00e0nguiz headed home Chile's first goal. Even the torrential rain could not drown out the excitement. Looking side to side, I pumped my fist, letting out a suppressed 'Vamos!' in the cheer-free press box. Four minutes later, when Jos\u00e9 Pedro Fuenzalida popped in Chile's second goal, the scene repeated, the roar of the Chilean barras (fan sections) bellowing even louder. Surveying the whole situation from above, I could only smile. It was the pinnacle moment of my sportswriting career thus far, and certainly a crowning episode of my lifelong passion for sports.I have always had a unique enthusiasm for sports. Rather than simply cheering on my favorite team, I would scan daily box scores as a kid and absorb every bit of analysis. Due to this interest, I read Michael Lewis's Moneyball, which describes how the Oakland Athletics used statistics to optimize their success on a small budget. That application of mathematics into sports really resonated with me because I see sports as a numbers game, a chess match, where a club of players, coaches, and executives must come together to find on-field triumph. Seeing sports through that lens set my journalist career in motion. I joined a small NBA blog in eighth grade and now, less than three years later, I was in Chicago covering the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario semifinal between Chile\u2013my Chile\u2013and Colombia.This game was a prime example of why I love sports, and particularly f\u00fatbol, so much: the action provides a universal language for people of all backgrounds to connect. In Latin America, f\u00fatbol has united countries torn apart by prejudice and become a second religion for many, including myself. Growing up with my father's Chilean influence, I have always wanted to connect to my Latino roots, and I have done that through The Beautiful Game. Being surrounded by tens of thousands of likeminded La Roja (Chilean national f\u00fatbol team) supporters from around the world meant so much more to me than the match itself, because it gave me a tangible tie to my heritage.My father and grandfather were born in Chile and my great-grandfather, Israel Drapkin, from whom I got my middle name, grew up there after moving from Argentina. Israel was a doctor on the Easter Island expedition which discovered that the moai (monolithic human statues found on the island) were made by ancestors of the Rapa Nui and he supplied leprosy care for the island's indigenous people. Learning about my past and the distinct experiences that make up Chile's rich culture, however, was different than getting to enjoy them in person. My grandparents would make empanadas de pino (savory, meat-stuffed pastries) and pastel de choclo (beef and corn shepherd's pie) on occasion when I visited, but it was not until I started covering La Roja that I began to really embrace my ancestry in a meaningful way. The Copa Am\u00e9rica allowed me to really see the culture firsthand, with the smell of fresh-cooked pregame asados (barbecues) and the sounds of national pride filling the atmosphere throughout the spectacle. The intensity of that pride only rose once the game got underway, and after finishing the press conferences and publishing my game story, I felt a certain sense of completeness.When my Uber dropped me off at the airport at 3 a.m., 12 hours after my arrival in Chicago, I was exhausted, but still riding the wave of euphoria from Chile's 2-0 win. F\u00fatbol, like English and Spanish, is a language that can bridge gaps and enrich lives across the globe, and I had seen my two cultures blended together through sports right on the field in front of me. Through writing, I try to bring South American f\u00fatbol to North America, with the hope of capturing my experiences and enabling others to find the same passion within themselves.",,,
152,Admitsee,3.5,,,3,,5,,"Since the time I could understand it, I've had an interest in childbirth. This inherent interest led me to discover the practice of midwifery, a type of maternity care that stresses natural births led by midwives, and I soon became passionate learning more about its differences with traditional hospital maternity care, which is led by obstetricians, physicians trained in childbirth. Through articles, documentaries and books I came to understand the advantages and positive outcomes of midwife-led births, and conversely, how hospital births could negatively impact women by providing too many medical interventions. At the same time, not only did I want to pursue something I was passionate about, but also challenge myself to do better than my parents. My parents believe I can do better than them and with all respect, I believe I can. Not because I believe I am more gifted or that they were not as determined, but because they started from the ground up and laid the foundation, giving me the opportunities that they did not have. I knew studying medicine and becoming a physician - a career I could be passionate about - was a way I could accomplish my hopes of building upon my parent'sachievements. Midwifery, while a respectable career, wasn't exactly what either I or my parents had envisioned. With time ticking, and knowing I didn't want to enter college undecided, I thought I had two choices: midwifery or medicine. Both allowed me to engage with a passion of mine, but I couldn't be an obstetrician and a midwife. That's not how it worked.Then, one day it came to me all of sudden: Why do I have to submit to established options? Why do I have to choose one or the other? Why can't I be a changemaker in maternity care in America?By challenging the belief that I had to make a choice based on established options, I became someone inspired to make change. No longer was I bound to the predetermined path. By simply deciding mentally not to conform to established options - midwife or obstetrician - I opened a door of initiative, creativity and vision. Now I hope that one day, as someone trained both as a physician and midwife, I can bridge the gap between hospital and midwifery maternity care. I want women to have the safety of a hospital birth and the independence of a midwifery birth. If we hope for our nation's maternity system to improve and for maternity death rates to decrease, we need both. There's no joint program to become both a midwife and a physician, but that doesn't mean I can't do it - it simply means I have to take the initiative to complete both trainings separately. As for changing America's maternity care to provide safer births for women, there's no easy twelve step solution -creativity and vision are vital to drawing out and accomplishing goals. What's established does not dictate what can be done, and I hope that by shattering the idea that I have to choose medicine over midwifery or vice versa, I can not only prosper as an individual, but make an impactful change.Now that I fully grasp the magnitude of this concept, I can never envision my career, let alone my life, as a series of predetermined paths. I reject that. Progress can't be made from the vision that how things are is how they'll always be; rather, it is through envisioning a better future you can help create, that progress is made. I never thought I was someone with a mission to change, but by challenging the belief that I had to choose one path, I became someone with the vision and mentality to do so.",,,

154,Admitsee,3.5,1,,,,,6,"I was ten-years-old and stuck in a room with no space. I rushed to the hall closet, got the drawing pad, and went to work. My mind flooded with ideas, a phenomenon that I called 'designer's high,' which would, overtime, become ordinary in my everyday life. I settled on a somewhat unorthodox, yet space efficient design: I would build a platform that hangs five feet above the floor (my approximate height at the time) and would suspend my bed, leaving abundant floor space. Two weeks later, after multiple struggles to find studs in the wall, keep my parents on board, and dodge the cold hands of death (it was my first time using power tools), my design, a once intangible idea, finally materialized. It was at this moment that I found a direction. What started as a physical space problem in my room became a metaphor for the numerous areas in my life where I could create space and make room for change. I needed to create space in order to initiate change. But where to start? Naples High School, and others surrounding it, is teeming with high-functioning, over-driven, and hyper-competitive students that compromise their happiness now for the success that they believe they will receive in the future. I believe that this is flawed. People must be positive in the present in order to experience a 'happiness advantage.' Most believe that if they work hard, then they will be more successful, and if they are more successful, then they will be happier. However, this creates a never-ending cycle, continuously changing the goal-post of success and pushing happiness off the visible spectrum. If you get a good grade, then you need a better grade. If you made $10, now you need to make $15. In that, the degree of success determines one's innate happiness level. It seems as though people function better, more productively, more creatively, and more intelligently when they are happy. I believe that the success-driven formula for happiness is scientifically backwards. The lens through which our brains view the world shapes our reality, and this lens has been altered in a way that introduces stress and anxiety into our lives, a lot like the clutter in my room, decreasing our happiness quotients. Much like the space that was needed in my room, space was now needed elsewhere: to make room for happiness at my school. It seems as though, regardless of the goals they intend to accomplish, students are conditioned to be happy after they get what they want, so I aimed to create a program that would put students at the helm of the ship: The Leadership Club. As president and creator of the newly founded club, I was able to secure a seat on the Student Advisory Council (SAC); seats were typically only held by parents and administrators. This position was extremely instrumental, considering all decisions for the school had to be passed through the SAC. Having this seat allowed students to bear a voice in what happens at the school and within the community. With hopes to brighten the spirits of my classmates, the club put on multiple outdoor concerts during lunch (because I believe music is a foundation of happiness), worked with Hope for Haiti (because doing good feels good), and has even set up events to take place at the school for years to come, successfully digressing students' minds from their chock-full schedules and cluttered lives to finally make space for happiness. While the problem that I solved is small in the whole scheme of world problems, its significance to me is unyielding. To create and promote happiness for those around me sparked a piece of my mind. Everyone is born with 'a little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it.'",,,

156,Admitsee,3.5,,,,,5,,"Eating at HoHo's (a 'Chinese' restaurant in Blairstown, NJ) was one of my favorite parts of being away at boarding school. I had grown to love American Chinese food. Whether consuming fried rice from an oyster pail, scientifically measuring the perfect ratio of soy sauce to duck sauce (which was certainly not served in Asia), or opening a pseudo-philosophical fortune cookie, I savored the experience. Before coming to the US, my parents had warned me about American Chinese food's inauthenticity. Indeed, I had never seen this type of food served in Hong Kong or anywhere else in Asia. But I loved it nonetheless.Still, there was one thing I used to dread. Ordering takeout with my friends, they would inevitably ask: 'Do you think this is authentic?' I would then emphatically answer, no. This would end the conversation since, having lived in Hong Kong for most of my life, my American friends seemed to think I had authority in the matter.This June, having returned from the U.S. for the summer, I was hungry for 'real' Chinese cuisine. So I headed to a Cantonese restaurant downtown. As I sat at the round, linen-covered table, I felt like an eager child waiting to open Christmas presents. But when the menu came, my eyes widened in shock. General Tso's Chicken? This dish was one of my favorites at HoHo's, but it was classic American Chinese\u2013\u2013it didn't belong in Asia. I felt appalled. Nevertheless, I decided to order it. I needed to investigate the difference in taste between the HoHo's version and the Hong Kong version.The food came 15 minutes later. I could smell its mouth-watering aroma even before I saw the waiter approaching.He set the plate on the table. My eyes drank in the sight of that glazed, golden-brown chicken, faintly steaming. I crunched down on a morsel, relishing its taste: a perfect balance of sweet, salty, and spicy, coated in a crunchy, fried exterior. It was exactly like the General Tso's Chicken at HoHo's\u2014absolutely delicious. I was flabbergasted.Enjoying inauthentic food in an authentic restaurant felt wrong.Then I experienced an epiphany. What was wrong wasn't an authentic Chinese restaurant serving General Tso's Chicken, or even that I was enjoying it. What was wrong was me using the idea of authenticity as a measuring stick. Typically, food characterized as authentic is automatically embraced as good and food characterized as inauthentic is dismissed as bad. But in reality, authenticity is independent from taste. Inauthentic food can be good as well. Or maybe there's a middle ground, an authentic inauthenticity. After all, American Chinese food was specifically developed as a sort of fusion, and it works. It's delectable. This being true, I concluded that the simple, easy, authentic\/inauthentic distinction is meaningless.Just this summer, my friend Paul flew from Thailand to see me in Hong Kong. Before he headed home, we went souvenir shopping. He wanted something symbolic of his time visiting me. So, I took him to Mongkok, a relatively un-gentrified area where locals shop. In a small store, Paul picked up a grey tunic, colloquially known as the Mao Suit. These jackets became popular in China because leaders used to wear them in public meetings. The suit's reference to China's political history would make it a great souvenir. I didn't think Thailand had anything like that.Paul was ecstatic, and decided to try on his purchase. Yet, just as he was about to put it on, he paused and made a face. Confused, I looked closer. He held up the tag. It read: 'Made In Thailand.' Speechless, we looked at each other with awkward smiles. 'I like it,' he assured me. Indeed, regardless of where the t-shirt was made, it was a great souvenir.",,,

163,Admitsee,3,1,,,4,,,"The Sunday brunch was long ago created by the American dad. That fact alone should make you cautious; theAmerican dad is an unpredictable and crafty creature. He invented brunch solely to be commended after helaboured. It was paradoxical, then, when my non-American father decided that our family would join the waffleeating,pancake-hungry members of the Sunday Brunch Club because he simply could not cook. I assumed it wasan attempt to assimilate with American traditions. Since it was hopeless for my mother to start the tradition (shewas South-Korean with as little idea of what it was than my father), that low-risk yet high-reward once-a-weekmeal inevitably became my responsibility.And so, I hunched in front of the computer and researched. Taking advantage of Google as well as my reliablefriends Martha Stewart and Ina Garten, I discovered that eggs, bacon, pancakes, and waffles were traditionalSunday fare. Of course, bacon was a no-no; my entire family is Muslim. Nevertheless, I found an interesting note:the miraculous weekend brunch makes any household behave in a strange, atypical manner. No one dares to say'waffles again?' or 'no maple syrup!' With a grateful smile and a satisfyingly full belly, everyone thanks the cheflavishly and releases their very best compliments. It was settled. After all, I thought, who wouldn't want to bepraised for what seemed like a small task?It was definitely not a small task. In order to create the perfect batter consistency, I needed to put just enough milk.Too much, and it was runny. Too little, and the clumps created pockets of uncooked flour; definitely not appetizing.Mastering the flipping technique as well as rescuing the pancake at the precise point before it burned was anothertest. 'Trial and error,' I repeatedly announced after weeks of producing almost inedible pancakes. Maple syrupwas our only savior.Fortunately for my family's tastebuds, I got better. My parents eventually saw enough competency to purchase awaffle maker, a mark of my newly-found independence. After that, any recipe that fell into my hands, I created:French toast, omelettes, quiche, and (almost) every type of eggs. It was only until later that I found that instead ofassimilating us into American culture, Sunday brunch became a part of my family's diversity. Born into a practicingIslamic family with a converted South Korean mother and Pakistani father, I call Miami my birthplace; Sydney myentire childhood; and Incheon, South Korea my second home. I learned English first, studied Urdu script, taughtmyself Hangul, and grasped Arabic to read the Qu'ran. Unconsciously, American foods weren't the only thingsappearing at our brunch table; I added dishes like Dutch babies, beghrir, tamales, congee, and my favorite,shakshuka: a Tunisian poached egg dish mixed with tomatoes and other spices. My family's diversity enabled meto appreciate foods from across the globe, and my time spent with them during those lazy hours on Sundaymornings symbolized our multifaceted bonds. And, every time I sit in front of the blue light of the computer screento practice for FAMAT and Quiz Bowl competitions, or contact sponsors for the Pre-Med society's non profitorganization, Food52.com becomes my retreat. There's something comforting in the measurements of ingredients,a from-scratch recipe, and the origins of exotic foods like knishes (Yiddish) or kutabi (Azerbaijani). The high stressof cooking and baking, paradoxically, appeased me and, unsurprisingly, developed my self-sufficiency.Sunday brunch is the highlight of the week for me. Every time I hear the oven hum or sniff the musty scent of allpurposeflour, I remind myself of how far my roots expand across the globe, I think of the way a recipe has passedorally or through generations of family recipes, and most importantly, I thank that wily American dad who decidedto invent brunch one Sunday long ago.",,,

He was the living reincarnation of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Trent Folk: he screamed hard-pressed politics, courageous leadership, and raw potential. Beside him, I was Shrek, choking people with the sight of me. Flashback to fall 2016, sitting in the school conference room, I pointed at Mr. JFK, claiming him as my partner for the 2017 Model UN circuit. Though Trent had no experience, I was confident that he was worth the investment. That summer, our speeches echoed throughout Trent's garage, as our audience of wrenches and hammers listened to us practicing for the 'front- room,' the debate and speech portion of MUN. The hood of Trent's car was littered with post-it notes of resolutions and strategies, preparing us for the 'back-room,' the negotiations and politicking portion of MUN.Despite our preparation, we were placed in 'throw-away' committees that contained 300-500 people. Even worse, G20 countries routinely touted authority over our assigned countries that held minor real-world influence. But, at the end of each collegiate tournament, Trent and I returned with first-place gavels to add to our school's trophy case.Contrary to popular belief, the key to success has nothing to do with the country one is assigned. The key is simply to be the best delegate \u2013 a delegate who drops his\/her desires of winning, focuses on cultivating the relationships that UN was built upon, and immerses his\/her passions into discussions. Adaptability and leadership are critical components; MUN is about finding ways to bring everyone to the table.'We're soaring, flying\u2026' My horrible rendition of Disney's High School Musical theme song stirs sleepy delegates awake.'And the drones kill innocent children on the streets!' The sudden change in tone captivates everyone's attention.With all eyes on me, I begin my official front-room speech: 'Yemen proposes the transgovernmental networking program in response to terrorism\u2026' Though MUN is a simulation, the leadership and public speaking skills I've gained pushed me to become more civically engaged, serving as a congressional intern for the Office of Representative John Delaney. In this role, I'm responsible for constituent services, legislative research, and community outreach. So, on a warm April afternoon, when Gina stomped in, I was eager to help.'Darn! The life insurance company increased my premiums because of my genes! Discrimination, I tell you! Can't you sue?' I calmed her down, gathering the paperwork needed to start a case and sleuthing her background as she left.Surprisingly, her file was bombarded with reports of abuse, misconduct, and lawsuits, beckoning me to take on the challenge.Bring it.In the 'front-room,' the ofice's small conference room, staffers listened to my spiel on opening Gina's case and amending legislation. In the 'back-room,' my office, I glued my pen to my legal pad, jotting down notes on legal proceedings and precedents, compiling research on Gina's high-profile case for congressmen to review.Drafts and drafts of legislation rolled out of printers, soon making their way into the halls of Congress. Inevitably, Gina's case will be but a single piece of legislative agenda lying amidst haystacks of agendas on the congressional floor, but Gina will prevail for she is no ordinary constituent. She is none other than the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, prohibiting the use of genetic information in health insurance and employment.But, she yearns for greater responsibility, extending her influence onto the life insurance industry \u2013 my job is to turn her dreams into reality. Contrary to popular belief, the key to success has nothing to do with the title of one's position.

I have tried to teach myself everything I possibly could in the process. Biding my time, I have gathered entire libraries, stacked them on top of each other, and built myself an incunabular throne. I have parted seas of pages and cut my tongue on sharp turns of phrase. More often than not, I have chosen print over people and poetry over my peers. I have read well beyond my years. Along with perspective and self-knowledge, autodidacticism has shown me a profound sense of isolation.For most of my high school career, I had few close friends under the age of twenty-four. It was hard for me to imagine that this was only a phase: one with a clear beginning that would eventually come to an end. On a different day I might have told you I never had a childhood, but looking back on photos like that one from Halloween of 2008 I feel differently. On a more difficult day I might resent the notion of spending even a moment dwelling on a point so fixed in my past, but in time I've come to appreciate the opportunity for reflection.In the picture I am there, a well-dressed hot dog tightly clutching my Ketchup candy bag, with my friends Haidee, Sydney, and Portia in full maiko garb. (This was before we as a society decided that white girls really shouldn't dress up as geishas.) I don't remember much about that night in particular, but I do know that when I was in third grade, the ever-widening gap between me and most others was still just a negligible fissure\u2014a tiny crack in the ground I had so firmly planted myself in. In the photo is a simpler girl, I think, but a sincerely hopeful one.When I look back at pictures like those, I am glad that she gets to live in those moments forever. Though she is younger and not yet so jaded, I don't envy the little girl in those photographs at all. I used to want to go back and warn her that life will get roughbefore it gets easier, and that good and bad times will come around again years after this essay is written. She'll know a few years of being a pensive misfit before re-emerging from her paperback shell. But if she got word of how difficult life would get without knowing how gratifying it would all be, she might have given up hope\u2014become stagnant and satiable\u2014and we needed those years, she and I. As I get older, I become less 'mature for my age' and more of a normal person. I am still a bookworm, but I am also a milk tea enthusiast and a beach bum. As I face the reality ofleaving my hometown, I am learning to truly appreciate the childhood friends who have stayed in my life; I'm so glad they are all still as loving as ever, and always willing to go on boba runs or midnight beach adventures with me.I am still learning and growing every single day, and by the time I submit this essay I probably won't even be the same girl who is writing it now. That girl in the photograph reminds me of both how far I have come and how far I still have to go. I don't think eitherof us can really imagine all that lies ahead, but I'm trying to, and I am more excited about the future than ever.I hope to never grow stagnant and satiable, to always want more for myself, and to always look back on old photographs and wonder what life would have been like if I knew then what I know now.On Being a Hot DogOver the past few years, I have waited rather impatiently for an age at which my existence makes a little moresense.

170,Admitsee,3.5,,,3,,,,"As soon as I heard Ms. Cheung introduce herself, my head turned, and my eyes lit up. While I was used to hearing Cantonese in passing in Hong Kong, Mandarin was something completely different. Its sound somehow had the tenderness of a lullaby but the intensity of a battle cry. Instantly captivated by this peculiar language, I spent the whole weekend perfecting my intonation. The following Monday, I skipped into class excited to show off what I thought was a unique superpower. That day, everyone in class 3B was gleefully greeted with 'Ni Hao!' Mandarin was just one of these moments for me. It also happened with my other languages - German, Spanish, and Latin. At first, studying different languages simultaneously was tough \u2013 I sat in German class, trying to comprehend the endless declensions, distinguishing a weak verb from a strong one, and correctly identifying gender, and the next minute walked into Mandarin class, where such grammar rules were unheard of. But becoming comfortable with the drastic differences between each was worth the struggle. I like to think of learning a language as being given a key to a locked door. By travelling, and integrating with communities outside my own, I am using that key to open doors. When I travelled to Germany and eagerly embarked on a German immersion course, I stepped out into the cobbled back alleyways and felt an immediate sense of liberation. I was free to traverse the spirited streets of Berlin; hearing native Berliners chat with each other helped improve my articulation. Observing daily routines helped me understand the lifestyle. The almost tangible aura of unstifled creativity and bohemian zeal in Kreuzberg inspired me to continue pursuing my love of capturing the raw beauty around me through photography and filmmaking. Learning languages has ironically taught me that words cannot express everything. My project \\\u2018Laconic', a compilation of my photography and short films, aims to evoke emotion and provoke thought, using as little language as possible. When I travelled to Shanghai, language again provoked emotion as, instantly recognizable as a foreigner, people were shocked when I replied to them in Mandarin. Encouraged by their smiles, I felt a connection in every encounter. The barriers of cultural comprehension broke down; a shared language had brought us together. Breaking free from the barriers of cultural comprehension has always been important to me, but this is not just limited to my foreign languages. I joined Eton's Feminism Society (FemSoc) because I discovered there is a problem in my school: the issue of gender equality is not talked about enough among students, teachers and the local community. I've noticed the common misconceptions associated with feminism, the most common of which being feminists seek to promote female domination at the expense of men. How can we solve this problem, when the very definition of the issue is constantly misconstrued? Through discussion, through language, through action.The first step to fight misogyny is to educate. Every Wednesday, FemSoc provides a safe space for the school community to voice their beliefs and to listen to the opinions of others. I am currently in contact with members of the St Mary's Ascot Feminism Society, an all-girls school equally committed to the promotion of feminism. Through discussion, boys at Eton will have the chance to hear about the real-life experiences of girls growing up in a female-dominated environment. Through FemSoc, I am determined to help lead a better-informed community against everyday sexism, to help break down the barriers existing in today's society. The ever-increasing inter-connectivity in today's world constantly fuels my desire to continue opening doors and breaking down cultural and linguistic barriers. Globalisation often leads to a collision of worlds, but with a mastery of Chinese and German, as well as other languages I'll study in the future, I hope to transform these collisions into opportunities, from which I can learn and grow.",,,
171,Admitsee,3.5,,,3,,5,6,"Revolution: it was a strange concept to grasp as a seven-year-old obsessed with The Hunger Games, but nineyears later, I saw one for myself in Kashmir.I watched my 19-year-old cousin hold back tears as she described her helplessness \u2014 her life confined to herhome because of daily curfews, enforced after protests against youth shot. Wherever we drove, the Indian armywarily clutched their rifles. Their camouflaged uniforms stuck out like eyesores in the beautiful valley. For 70 years,Kashmiris have fought for the right to self-determination. My parents had always told me about Kashmir, theirmilitarily-occupied and disputed homeland, yet I remained unaffected. I soaked up the comforts of my freeAmerican life \u2014 unaware of the bullets that could strike my family at any moment, the suffering of my ownKashmiri people.At Model UN conferences, I debated the concept of suffering though. I tackled oppression in Syria and the GazaStrip, and deep down I knew Kashmir was no different. Nevertheless, even after these conferences, I was notaware.At my most recent conference, my committee had a choice whether to debate water security or ArtificialIntelligence. I vividly remember the vote. My heart sunk, the thumping of its nervous racing overwhelmed by thewave of hands rising in favor of water security. My partner and I had found Artificial Intelligence more interesting,so with just two weeks to prepare, we had colored the library's whiteboard into a rainbow with notes on drones andspeech recognition for hours after school. The late nights ran through my head, painful reminders of sacrificedsleep and time, and my confidence waned.By the end of that weekend, though, my browser was littered with tabs: omniprocessors, infrastructure, geneticallymodified foods \u2014 anything relevant to water security. I was in disbelief when I found myself standing on thepodium, the award for Best Delegate in my hands.But how much did that really mean? Did I get excited about having to explore a topic I would have otherwiseneglected? Or did I just see it as a burden? Did I even think about the millions of people suffering without accessto clean water? Or was I too focused on 'winning?'My motivations in Model UN always lacked genuine purpose. I didn't compete so I could build a strongunderstanding of international issues or collaborate with others. Instead, the topics I so often debate \u2014 worldhunger, genocide, the refugee crisis \u2014 were games to me, standing in my path to victory. I preoccupied myselfwith becoming a group leader, directing the conversation, and giving unique speeches with silly proverbs insteadof treating my topics as tragedies I genuinely care about, and that itself is a tragedy.However, my recent trip to Kashmir sparked a change; it brought to life the extreme hardships millions of peopleface daily. Seeing the crushing situation and its effect on my cousin has made my previously distant attachment toKashmir more personal and almost tangible. It gave me a sense of responsibility to strive to make an impact in theworld that stretches far beyond Kashmir's tattered borders, no matter how difficult.I recognize I must start somewhere, even if it's just sincerely caring about topics at seemingly insignificant ModelUN conferences. When I travel to Budapest this winter for my first international conference, I hope to distancemyself from the pressure to 'win.' I hope to instead redefine success for myself and prioritize learning somethingnew.What started as just a vacation to visit family has become the beginning of a personal movement: a movement tolearn, to explore, and eventually to act. But for now, I hope to continue taking small steps towards achieving myultimate goal: becoming a global citizen who sparks change by tackling the world's most challenging problems.Even if the odds may never be in my favor.In Kashmir this past summer I watched my 19-year-old cousin hold back tears as she described her helplessness- her life confined to her home because of daily curfews and her exams halted by sixth-month school closures. For 70 years, Kashmiris have fought for the right to self-determination.

172,Admitsee,4,1,2,,,,6,"A large blue storage bin still sits on the top shelf of a closet in my house. An outsider wouldn't give much thought to it - they probably wouldn't ever see it at all. But if you stood on your tippy toes and reached to the top shelf, took down the bin and blew off the decade of dust, you'd find the remnants of a world that exists only in the very limits of my imagination. Indeed, this inconspicuous container practically overflows with the colorful, magical dress-up supplies of my childhood. Pirate swords, princess tiaras, and secret agent gear were my lifelines, truly the defining characteristics of my youth. No one played pretend like I did.This wasn't necessarily a quality that made me incredibly popular in elementary school. If you wanted to play pretend with me, you had to have a detailed character analysis. If you are a princess, what kind of gloves are you wearing? What color is your dress? What's your princess' favorite food, and what does she think about the meaning of life? If I was going to construct a fantasy world of my own devising, I had to be able to fully immerse myself in it. One might call this an unhealthy obsession, but I called it an exceptionally active imagination.As I moved through high school, something in me shifted, prompting me to think differently about the made-up characters. They had always been manifestations of solely my own imagination, but thensome undefinable thing drew me to instead look to the stories of real people who lived on this earth, people who had their own narratives to tell. I became engrossed in the study of history. The fantastic realization that there is an infinite world of stories and characters out there sparked within me a determination to understand as much as I could about it.In my mind lies a plethora of facts, dates, and names. Slivers of time are shoved into every cranny of my brain. I can hardly close my eyes without seeing scenes of ancient battles and historic moments flicker on the back of my eyelids. I don't count sheep at night anymore; now I recite the names and dates of things that would generally only matter to you if you are older than 200. August twentieth, four hundred and eighty before the common era - the Battle of Thermopylae. June twenty-sixth, seventeen hundred and twenty-one common era - the first smallpox inoculation on the American continent. I hardly remember the date of my own birthday, but I can rattle off details all the way down to the weather forecast for events that happened centuries ago.History is what's right out of the corner of your eye. It's like chasing someone and finding out that you just missed them. It's longing for someone you've never met, and having nostalgia for memories that aren't yours. When I turn a tattered yellow page, the ghosts of the past whisper to me. I rarely listen to them. They hardly ever agree with each other. Still, I don't mind it. It's a familiar comfort.And it sometimes feels funny that I can call these ghosts \\\u2018familiar.' But every person that I study once had a favorite color, loved someone, hated someone, lost something they just put there, watched the clouds in the sky, and had an infuriatingly catchy song stuck in their head. Robespierre once wrote an ode to jam tarts and Aaron Burr splurged on the purchase of a coconut. These seemingly insignificant details shape us into who we are, whether they're recorded in history or not. The transformation from a little girl who loves to play dress-up into a scholar with obsessed with the past hinged on the acceptance of that fact: that people are people, and that those who choose to learn about them will always have an endless story to explore.They say that, if you can see a tsunami wave on the horizon, you are too close to escape it. As a seventh grader, I saw my mom wear mismatched shoes to work. At the time, I didn't realize that that was the tsunami on the horizon.My mother was diagnosed with Frontotemporal Dementia in 2013. It was a wave siphoning all of my familiar waters. And I, on the brink of adolescence, was helpless: helpless to stop it, helpless to resist, helpless to do anything but run to higher ground and wait for the water to crash over everything that I once knew.My mother was my best friend as a child. We laughed, talked about elementary school drama, took trips to Disney World, and made pizza on family night. She kissed me goodnight, read stories and went to all of my dance recitals. I could not have asked for a more quintessentially perfect childhood. But a calm before a storm can't last forever.A tsunami wave in the distance doesn't appear to be nearly as powerful as it is. You can hardly believe it's happening. But then, the wave crashes on the shore. And your best friend is drowning in confused speech, and can't focus on her work or even write legibly. She is forced to quit her job because she can't think anymore. She stays in bed all day. I didn't understand, is she unable to get up? Or does she just not want to? Turns out, it was a combination of both.Most people don't become the parent to their parent until they're at least old enough to be an actually have kids themselves. But what do you do when you're in that role as a middle schooler?The water rushes onto the land. The line between the world that I knew and the turbid, gushing water becomes obscured. It overwhelms any structure it passes, destroying it in one blow and whisking away the rubble. My mother's mind continued to deteriorate. I was afraid to share things with her. She couldn't communicate and she would randomly blurt out insults towards me or other people who I knew she once cared for. Her filter was gone, and so was the love or support I once counted on.This particular disease is characterized by the loss of mental and physical abilities, starting with complex decision- making skills and ravaging through the brain, destroying everything until it finally reaches the essential bodily functions, killing you.I ran to higher ground. I didn't talk to anyone about what was happening in my home. If anyone asked about my mother, I told them that she had become a homemaker. It stemmed from self-consciousness about the situation at first, but by high school, it was second nature for me to do anything and everything I could to avoid the subject.My very last memories of her have her withering away in a wheelchair, less than 100 pounds, unable to communicate in any intelligible way, and stuck with a horrible grin plastered on her face because she couldn't control those muscles anymore. I didn't get to be with her when she died. It was the night before my 16th birthday, but I was out of town that week. I didn't cry, and I still didn't tell anyone. I had already shed all the tears I possibly could.Now, the water has finally receded. I had to focus on the repair.I never perceived my life to be that different throughout this ordeal. But I look back and realize how quickly a catastrophic family illness and the grief that followed made me mature, and how I was put in a position where I had to be my own emotional support during those tumultuous high school years. I'll be proud that I faced the tsunami and came out wiser, stronger and more aware of my horizons.",,,
173,Admitsee,4,1,2,,,5,6,"Tick, Tock, Tick!' The clock ticked and soon enough, my heartbeat could be heard doubling the tick of the clock, synchronizing with every downbeat. My eyes burned from straining too long at a piece of paper and my hand was indented from the weight of the pencil. I nervously glanced around the room, and noticed that a few of my classmates had abandoned hope and were sleeping in despair. On the other hand, there remained a few intent individuals who continued working. Determined not be outdone, I quickly resumed my concentration. As the clock ticked, the pressure in the room began accumulating and my heart began to race. I desperately scanned through my work, double and triple checking every line, however, the solution still evaded me. Rubbing my bleary eyes, I sat up, still focused on the paper. Suddenly, in my peripheral vision, I spotted what I was looking for: the final word. Incredulous, I hastily rechecked my answer but the result proved unchanging. I finally had completed my word-search.I have always had a penchant for puzzles. In elementary school, when crossword puzzles and word-searches were frequent assignments done in class, I would race to be the first to finish. As my intellectual capacity progressed, so did the types of puzzles I enjoyed. Word-searches and crossword puzzles soon turned into riddles and rubix cubes and eventually, into Java exercises. Java provided limitless fuel for my thirst of puzzles; so many applications exist that the possibilities are endless. This sort of capability and power piqued my interest and as I learned more, I only became certain that I had finally discovered what I was looking for: the ultimate challenge.I first took an Intensive Introduction to Java Programming course at Harvard University over the summer of 11th grade. At first, there was so much information to process and I was overwhelmed. Even the simplest lines of code were beyond my understanding, yet I remained intrigued. Over the next seven weeks, I eagerly devoured each new piece of information. I spent many late nights watching tutorial videos, reading the textbooks and consulting with fellow classmates over problem sets. In my free time, I explored with various codes and even worked on side projects of my own. These creations performed simple tasks, such as row-reducing a matrix or calculating one's age, and took more work to program than to simply undertake, nevertheless I enjoyed the process. The course consumed the entirety of my time, as I would often find myself pondering which algorithm to implement when in the shower, during meals, and even in the middle of pickup basketball games at the gym. As the weeks passed, all the pieces soon began to fall into place. Each completed program added one more piece to my ongoing puzzle of Java and my knowledge grew bit by bit. It was not long before I could begin to fully understand and write my own complete programs. Then, in no time, these simple codes evolved into more complicated programs such as a Battleship game client, a Sudoku Solver and Binary Tree iterators. From there, I never looked back. From this, I learned to take everything piece by piece and set small goals, just like when solving a puzzle. It is too easy to get lost looking at the big picture, so I remain focused on the little things. When times get tough, I remember to keep trodding along, placing the pieces one by one, steadily making progress. This has always been my strategy for completing puzzles, and has now translated to all things I do in life, including programming. Flash-forward to my senior year. I am back in the classroom again, racing to complete a challenge against a group of friends. The situation is oddly reminiscent. However this time, instead of a word-search, it is a Java exercise and this time, I will finish first.One chilly April morning, while other people were still buried in the warmth of their bed, I was in the woods with my buddy, Will. We were on a mission to catch turtles, one that we had planned for hours on before deciding upon a satisfactory plan.Once inside the forest, I felt the call of adventure in my blood. I was unstoppable, ready to take on any obstacle. As we started our journey, the icy winds blew harder, seemingly to obstruct us. We climbed over many hills and through many bushes, under many valleys and over many streams. My feet ached from trekking and my hands were all scratched up from stray branches. Finally, after a backbreaking journey, we managed to reach the cherished destination: a thin, trickling creek. However, our journey had only just begun. I encountered a variety of fish and the occasional reptile, but the elusive turtles were nowhere to be found. The water was ice-cold and my feet were freezing, yet I continued with only one thought in mind: turtles. My determination was soon rewarded. Entrenched in the shallow edges of the creek and camouflaged by his surroundings, laid a small turtle. I carefully approached and picked him up. After a brief contemplation, we decided upon the name, Oliver, because of his olive-greenish color. Oliver came with us on the trip back, and remained largely unconcerned about his imprisonment. In fact, he held his head up high in confidence, as to look forward towards his uncertain future. Over the course of the next few days, I started to rethink this incident. What if Oliver missed his home? What if he was scared out of his shell? I struggled with this dilemma for days. One particular night, I laid in bed, tossing and turning, before realizing that deep down, I had always known what to do. I had to return Oliver back. So the next day, I called my friend and convinced him of my worries. Once again, we prepared to make the arduous hike. This time, the trip to the secluded home of Oliver went by quickly, perhaps because I was lost in thought, thinking of Oliver. Although I had not known him long, I knew that it would be a difficult farewell. When it was finally time to let him go, my eyes began to water, and it was not because of the rain.To this day, Oliver remains a symbol of confidence. During times of hardship, I reflect upon Oliver's resiliency. More importantly, this adventure is one of many that has shaped my development. I am not afraid to try anything new and welcome any challenges. As a result, I've had my share of ups and downs and have experienced emotions on the far ends of the spectrum. I have laughed, cried, and done both at the same time. These experiences have imparted on me the joy of discovery, as well as the tears of pain and farewell. I have scuba dived in the depths of the ocean, bungee jumped off sky-high platforms, and gotten lost in the mountains. I have lived in the rural countrysides of China, taught English to young children, and played my violin in the busy streets of downtown. Although I do take my academics very seriously, I also enjoy a good adventure once in awhile. After all, life is meant to be an adventure.",,,

175,Admitsee,4.5,1,2,,,5,,"I've always despised the cockroach. Their dark, armored bodies, small, ticklish legs, and long, tentacle-like antennae. It's not that I hate all bugs; the ant is industrious and playful, the ladybug is sweet and thoughtful, the daddy longlegs is graceful and mysterious. But something is just different about the cockroach, something that makes my skin crawl.I remember crouching around my grandmother's kitchen table playing Scrabble, deep in thought about how to manipulate my nearly impossible combination of letters to form a word, while maneuvering the board as to achieve optimal points scored. As I rotated the smooth, wooden 'Q' in my hand, a scurrying along the floor dragged me out of my Scrabble hypnosis.My eyes darted towards the ground. There it was. The roach. Its fat, bloated body lurked closer and closer to my chair. As I leapt onto the table like an ape, the Scrabble tiles flew into the air, crashing onto the linoleum floor below like pellets of hail during an autumn storm. 'Kill it, grandma!' I wailed, petrified. She pulled off her slipper, slamming it hard onto the cockroach's scuffling body. My deepest fears subsided now that the roach was dead.Suddenly, from under the slipper, an antennae poked out, then another, as the resurrected roach squirmed free, alive. Its legs scampered as it dashed out of danger and vanished into a crack in the wall. My heart still pounded, though the cockroach was now gone. 'Those suckers always seem to get away. Luckily,' grandma said, 'cockroaches only live down south. You won't have to worry about those up north.' I thought I had escaped the roaches. Little did I know.Six years later, I'm sitting next to Amy Robbins, Syracuse, New York's premier early morning radio broadcaster, practically a celebrity in these parts. I place the headphones over my ears as the sound of the outside world fades away, and I'm transported into a different realm. The song dissipates. Sound bites are cut and merged together as the advertising jingle begins. And finally, Amy speaks. I smile like a fanboy as each crisp word rolls off her tongue.The day's top stories, weather, a phone-in, and finally it's my turn to speak. My hands tremble from the excitement of it all as I clench the paper tightly, the lines I am to recite scribbled illegibly across the page. Except, I'm frozen. Immobilized. Unable to speak. My heart beats faster and faster, and I try to force the words out, but it's as if my brain is disconnected from my tongue. It's not stage fright that's awakening this panic, it's something else. And I see it. Slowly, deliberately climbing up the cord of my headphones. The roach: it's back.I'm living my dream, live on-air in front of thousands of listeners. It's my chance to shine, my chance to speak. And I'm screwing it all up. The roach's fat, bloated body inches closer and closer to my head as it clings to the cord.But too horrified to slap it away, I leave listeners with the longest awkward silence in the history of 93Q Radio.'Say your lines!' Amy scowled, unaware of the roach.I feel the greasy cockroach launch onto my scalp, where it stops its journey and nestles deep into my thick head of hair. This time, I'm not going to jump on the table. I woke up an hour early for this; I'm not going to let some uncrushable bug stand in the way of my dream.I take a gulp, breath in, and begin to speak. Broadcasting, live on air. I feel like a real journalist, even if for just a second.

184,Admitsee,4.5,1,2,,4,5,,"Two whistles sliced through the tumult and the band lurched forward. Cymbals, drums, tubas, and the buoyant pop of confetti cannons reverberated through the humid Texan evening as all 216 members of our Troy High marching band thundered through San Antonio for the Fiesta Flambeau, America's Largest Illuminated Parade. The LED lights we had threaded down our pant legs and across chest straps set our uniforms ablaze against a dusky purple sky. Advancing in unison, I remembered why I joined marching band: to belt out halftime tunes on bus rides, to breathe in the frigid Autumn air during Friday night home games,to feel every marching step resound through my bones. I had yearned for this sense of community when my mom left my nuclear family halfway through ninth grade\u2014she had accepted a promotion that required returning to China, the country she had grown up in before emigrating to the United States as an adult twenty years ago. When she left for China, life at home felt empty without her constant reminders to stand up straight, finish everything on my plate, and pack another lunch, just in case. I felt torn at her decision to return, not knowing what to feel or say as she packed up her old life, her travel brochures, clothes, and favorite pieces of porcelain scattered across the living room floor. As our band wove through a figure-eight routine at the corner of Broadway and Commerce, I found myself wrapped in memories of the past and cut my figure-eight too sharply, colliding with a bandmate. Our LED cords ensnared us in a thorny embrace as the lightbulbs and safety pins on our uniforms melded into a clotted nebula of light flashing on and off at our elbows. The more we tried to pull away, the more we seemed tied together, so I panicked and yanked our battery packs from our overalls. As our uniforms suddenly shut off, I felt overwhelmed by the pulse of frenzied rhythms, the crowd's rumbling and swelling behind traffic barriers, and, most of all, the painful flashes of what my life could have been if my mom had stayed. Fumbling with the clump of cords in the dark, I took a deep breath and let my fingers slip over the knot, slowly unraveling its intricate web. The lights suddenly flickered on, dim at first, then blinding white as we became untangled, the last resoundingnote of our parade tune soaring over the crowd's roar. When my bandmate and I finally returned to our place in line, a wave of relief washed over me. The smoky evening air expanded in my chest, my hands stopped trembling, and the turmoil of moments ago turned into an inner stillness. Thentwo whistles called me back to attentionand the band staggered forward for another song. When we returned home from San Antonio, I tried deciphering why the tangled lights affected me so strongly, but in addition to describing the parade and our light-up uniforms, I found myself writing about my mom's decision to return to China. I thought about the pictures she had sent of her hang-gliding in Hong Kong\u2014her smile wide and framed by flyaway strands of hair\u2014and I realized she had left both to secure my future and to enjoy her own. In the following year, writing became a major part of my life as I began paying closer attention to my understanding of the world, untangling the knots of confusion I felt at my mom's decision to return to her homeland and my own identity as a second-generation Chinese immigrant. Writing guided me to a new understanding of my mom, myself, and the ways in which I am inextricably entwined with those who have impacted me\u2014I do not march, write, learn, or do anything alone. I am always indebted to family and community, our lights and lives tangled together.",,,
185,Admitsee,4,1,,,,5,6,"Chubby fingers outstretched and round cheeks flattened against the window, I leaned further into the plexiglass. Although I could feel a firm hand tugging at my shirt, urging me to sit back in my seat - at ten, I possessed little concept of manners (or sanitary awareness), both of which I abandoned as I refused to cease standing on the chair of the CTA train - at the moment, all that mattered was that I was soaring above the streets of Chicago. Eyes darting across the ever changing expanses of the city, I refused to lift my gaze in fear of missing anything.For the first time, I was taking a trip in the belly of a gargantuan silver beast, known familiarly to most Chicagoans as the 'L.'What distinguishes the L from its relatives - the Tube, le M\u00e9tro, the MTA - is its ability to burst through concrete and asphalt streets to rise above, guided only by wood and steel, and glide through the towering skyscrapers that dot the Chicago skyline. It elevates and cultivates a sense of infinite wonder in its riders, from the all-too-serious businessmen I've caught gazing dreamily out the windows to the young children futilely yet passionately attempting to balance in the center of the car as the train weaves throughout the city. From that first ride to the present day, my fascination with the inner and outer workings of the L and its passengers has refined itself to an infatuation.Each ride presents a chance to ponder the overlooked, to question the seemingly mundane: You can quantify the number of people that find themselves teeming through the L's sliding doors, but can you quantify their experiences? Who is that woman, man, student, small rodent, and what is their story? I adopt the lenses of journalists, economists, marketers, sociologists, historians, and the mere fellow passenger to analyze: the placement of an ad for Planet Fitness adjacent to an ad for Pizza Hut, the change in the racial makeup of passengers as the train travels North to South, the origin of unassuming stains or abandoned books. More recently I pondered, if they say the beat of a butterfly's wings can induce a hurricane halfway across the world, can a five minute train delay get me into college?The L is a catalyst between my vim mind and the seemingly elusive outer world, a seventy-five cent silver chariot that I can ride to whatever adventure I see fit. Since that first ride, I persist in search of the optimal collection of train stops, forging a mental map of Chicago shaped by my life experiences - all accessible by a simple swipe of a ventra card. The multitude of train lines that branch from the L's 'Loop' are dotted with my discoveries. The boathouse, where I strain my vocal chords from hours of training (and hours of laughing with my teammates). The school, where I test the waters of political responsibility, explore the depths of socioeconomic research, and conquer the wakes of edits delivered on my reporting for the newspaper. The small urban farm, located in a former project, that I help create and cultivate each spring and summer.My thirst and and hunger for the knowledge of anything and everything was, and remains, insatiable. This train, this beating artery, pumping from the birthplace of the city to its outer reaches, is what quenches my thirst and satiates my hunger. Riding the L not only gave me the access to pursue rowing, a liberal education, and volunteerism; it forged a sense of adventurousness deep into the synapses of my nerves, a sense driving me into the intersections of journalism, student government, fashion, and aiding my beautiful city. That first L ride instilled the interests that lie within me, passions that subsist on experiencing life at its fullest and engaging my sponge-like intellectuality. I thrive on discovery. It defines who I am.",,,
186,Admitsee,4,1,2,,4,5,,"Visits with my grandmother have always been awkward. I speak to her in mildly incoherent Mandarin as she pats my hand and smiles. It never bothered me much\u2014that is, until my sixteenth birthday.My entire family had come to celebrate at a local restaurant, including my distant cousin, with whom we had only spoken to through brief phone calls. Despite the initial strangeness of her presence, she naturally fell into conversation with my grandmother; it soon erupted with my grandmother's warm laughter\u2014 genuine and unrestrained.When the meal finished, my grandmother approached me, pressing a cold hundred-dollar bill in my hand. I accepted it with a pang, studying its waxy appearance, which looked cheaper than ever. Ostensibly representative of our relationship, I couldn't help but wonder if our love was merely obligatory\u2014a familial expectation.Months after, a family friend invited me to go to Taiwan to teach rural students English. I gladly accepted; teaching was something I loved, and I (idealistically) interpreted this as a chance to improve both my Mandarin and relationship with my grandmother.However, it was only once I arrived that I realized the enormity of my responsibilities. Not only did I have to maintain my own room and board, but I had to cook my students' meals as well. My thirty pupils were also of varying ages and levels; some knew nouns, while others only fragments of the alphabet. Progress was sometimes so slow that I had to revise weeks of lesson plans. Moreover, they stigmatized English, and our lack of connection only furthered their minimal and apathetic participation.As discouraging as this was, I was even more disappointed by my own inability to communicate. The language barrier was unyielding, creating a rift between me and my surroundings. In class, I was unable to congratulate (or reprimand) students. During lectures, I stumbled over words. These incidents often triggered a red flush\u2014painful reminders of what transpired on my birthday.Not trusting myself to speak decisively, I furthered my isolation. I was used to English as the world's lingua franca, and having it as anything but that terrified me. My feelings were only amplified by the exhaustion of ceaseless teaching, cooking, and cleaning. At night I often cried, sometimes out of pure loneliness, other times from sheer frustration in my own inabilities.One day after a particularly grueling lesson, a student with whom I had previous difficulties with shuffled towards me. Upon seeing him, I braced myself for complaints, but instead was greeted with a request for the English translation of 'uncle.' I answered him, surprised by his vulnerability. His interest spread quickly\u2014students soon approached me shouting new vocabulary like 'carrot!' or seeking nightly tutoring. One student even grabbed my hand and led me to a temple that overlooked the entire mountainside. Though sweaty and sun-beaten at the summit, I couldn't help but gaze, awestruck by the winding dirt roads and sprawled cabbage fields below. There was an inherent beauty to it all, something satisfying in its simple, albeit wordless, existence.Though this experience improved my Mandarin only marginally, I connected with these children through a dynamic foreign back home. Putting their needs ahead of mine became second nature; every morning, I served them the congee I'd just made, and every night I walked them home, often getting hugged good night. Our reciprocity of love and respect had been built by few words\u2014rather, actions. This experience catalyzed the growth of my self-confidence and consequently, my relationship with my grandmother. We now make mochi, her rough, cracked hands guiding mine. She shows me how to grind sesame seeds for the filling, how to stretch and knead the dough. Now, I am beginning to see delightful new things about her, from her crooked smiles to her playful eyes. Despite the time we've lost, I'm grateful and better understand that what we have\u2014what we've always had, verbal or not\u2014 is enough.",,,

189,Admitsee,4,1,2,3,,5,,"In second grade, I received my first pair of prescription glasses.Those oval lenses, while improving the images I saw around me, marked a steep decline in the image I saw of myself. Before glasses, I was too nearsighted to see images of my sister calling herself fat in the mirror as she examined her thin body; I was too nearsighted to see magazines lining aisles of grocery stores with covers displaying what a 'beautiful' woman looked like. And while my glasses gave me the ability to see clearly these outside images that were impressed upon my eight year old mind, it's ironic that, they also stripped me of the pure, innocent clarity with which I viewed myself.Over time, the concave lenses meant to correct my vision acted more like concave mirrors in a carnival fun house, leading to the start of my battle with anorexia.Though it's easy to blame my decline in self-esteem on these inanimate objects, the true bearers of blame were the people that made me feel insecure about my glasses in the first place. I was ostracized for being 'nerdy,' and the stereotypical connotation of glasses did not help.Their words were soon reinforced by my own self doubt. I thought that if I was thinner, more people would like me. And as I chipped away at myself, I needed something to fill the empty voids I created. Soon, even amidst the uproar of disparaging voices from everyone around me, it just so happened that I heard and was given purpose by the still, small voice I call God. That voice emerged over the lies that had been fed to me like the food I had avoided. 'My Masterpiece,' He said as He looked into my broken soul that I had been taught to hate. As I began to love myself again, I realized the need for more love in the world. It was in that moment of clarity that I decided to pursue science because I believed then, as I do now, that science truly has the power to change the world. To me, if I knew that my life's work would make a lasting impact on the world, then it didn't matter what the bullies in my life thought. To gain their acceptance was now such a trivial problem compared to the struggles faced by so many. For the struggling, I began to change the perspective I had seen myself through. For the impoverished, I poured myself into this new calling, driving an hour every day after school to conduct research. For the destitute, I embarked on this wonderful path of self discovery. In science, I felt accepted. In science, I felt whole, livened by the complexity of each experiment and my ability to make change. My passion carried me to Intel's International Science and Engineering Fair where I connected with individuals that gave a new meaning to the word 'nerd.' In this place, everyone and no one was considered a 'nerd.' In this place, I felt empowered by my peers and validated for my research, placing fourth internationally. I didn't know it then, but realize now that the saying 'It's not you but them' is wrong. It was me. It was always me, but not in the negative sense that is associated with the phrase. It is in the powerful sense that is displayed through this woman I have become. This realization led me to exceptional heights in my science career and will no doubt lead me higher. I am no longer the reflection of derogatory comments; I am now the initiator, executor, and conqueror of the dreams that were deemed 'too big.' I still wear my glasses. But clarity is a process that I am still learning, still learning to love myself inside and out. And slowly, those lenses that caused me to lose sight of myself are turning into symbols of personal growth that I proudly emblazon.To the woman at the basketball game,I saw you. I saw the way you looked at us. We were just sitting there, minding our own business, but you made a point to turn around and scoff at the contrast of our skin. Your disapproving eyes traveled the lengths of our bodies, lingering ever so slightly on our interlocked hands then continuing upward to meet my appalled gaze. You quickly turned back around, and thank God, because I don't know what I would have done had you not. I wanted to give you something to look at, make a scene, and relinquish this dam of rage that was building up inside me. I wanted to shame you for the thoughts that were so evident on your face, thoughts of prejudice and discrimination expressed through your upturned nose. You see, I don't care about the way you were raised. I don't care about your traditions and ideas of what a 'proper' relationship is. I don't care that you match Whites with Whites and Blacks with Blacks as if people were socks in your clean laundry. I wanted to enlighten you on your place--or lack thereof--in my relationship. But, I didn't. I just turned my eyes back to the game and kept quiet like I was taught. Girls don't have outbursts or cause chaos, especially Godly girls. He noticed though, he noticed the slight change in my composure. He asked if I was alright, and so I just smiled at him and told him that I was fine. Everything was alright, like it always was. I wanted to protect him. I didn't want his world to be tainted with your derogative attention on us. I'm not oblivious to racism. In fact I prepared myself for this very instance when I committed to loving him. My dad warned us not to go out by ourselves for this reason, for people like you. I knew we would face adversity but I didn't expect it to hurt so much. I didn't hurt for me, though, but for you. I hurt for you because he is the most respectful, Godly man I have ever crossed paths with. He is the most gentle, romantic, creative, and talented individual I have ever known. He has so much ambition and drive and dreams that could blow your mind. But you will never know him; you will never get the honor of knowing him because you can't get past the pigment in his skin. Yes, I am White and he is Black, and in some minds that is wrong. 'It hurts the children,' you argue, and you're right. It hurts your children, the children that you raise with the same racist perspective. Others are more supportive, saying they 'don't see color.' But I do. In fact, I like Black and White. They're opposite ends of a beautiful spectrum of light, encompassing every color of the rainbow in between. He is far from my opposite, but I am proud of our cultural differences. I am proud of the color of his skin and his family background because it adds so much diversity to my own. He is the Black to my White and the White to my Black, and together we create that entire spectrum of visible light: the vibrant red and orange in the sunset we watched on our first date, the yellow and green we took in as we walked through the autumn park, the blue indigo water we jumped into during our church retreat, and the light violet shirt I wore when we shared our first kiss.We are all of these colors, and I am heartbroken because the glasses that you wear make you so color blind. I am heartbroken because your White privilege acts to disprivilege you to all the vibrancy that life can offer.With hope for change,The White Girl Who Loves A Black BoyP.S.

I trace the fan blades as they swing above me, emitting a low, repetitive hum resembling a faint melody. After bringing our usual order, the 'Tailgate Special,' to the table, my father begins discussing the recent performance of Apple stock with my mother, myself, and my older eleven year old sister. Bojangle's, a Southern establishment well known for its fried chicken and reliable fast food, is my family's Friday night restaurant, often accompanied by trips to Eva Perry, the nearby library. With one hand on my breaded chicken and the other on Nancy Drew: Mystery of Crocodile Island, I can barely sit still as the thriller unfolds. They're imprisoned! Reptiles! Not the enemy's boat! As I delve into the narrative with a sip of sweet tea, I feel at home.'Five, six, seven, eight!' As I shout the counts, nineteen dancers grab and begin to spin the tassels attached to their swords while walking heel-to-toe to the next formation of the classical Chinese sword dance. A glance at my notebook reveals a collection of worn pages covered with meticulously planned formations, counts, and movements. Through sharing videos of my performances with my relatives or discovering and choreographing the nuances of certain regional dances and their reflection on the region's distinct culture, I deepen my relationship with my parents, heritage, and community. When I step on stage, the hours I've spent choreographing, creating poses, teaching, and polishing are all worthwhile, and the stage becomes my home.Set temperature. Calibrate. Integrate. Analyze. Set temperature. Calibrate. Integrate. Analyze. This pulse mimics the beating of my heart, a subtle rhythm that persists each day I come into the lab. Whether I am working under the fume hood with platinum nanoparticles, manipulating raw integration data, or spraying a thin platinum film over pieces of copper, it is in Lab 304 in Hudson Hall that I first feel the distinct sensation, and I'm home. After spending several weeks attempting to synthesize platinum nanoparticles with a diameter between 10 and 16 nm, I finally achieve nanoparticles with a diameter of 14.6 nm after carefully monitoring the sulfuric acid bath. That unmistakable tingling sensation dances up my arm as I scribble into my notebook: I am overcome with a feeling of unbridled joy. Styled in a t-shirt, shorts, and a worn, dark green lanyard, I sprint across the quad from the elective \\\u2018Speaking Arabic through the Rassias Method' to \\\u2018Knitting Nirvana'. This afternoon is just one of many at Governor's School East, where I have been transformed from a high school student into a philosopher, a thinker, and an avid learner. While I attend GS at Meredith College for Natural Science, the lessons learned and experiences gained extend far beyond physics concepts, serial dilutions, and toxicity. I learn to trust myself to have difficult yet necessary conversations about the political and economic climate. Governor's School breeds a culture of inclusivity and multidimensionality, and I am transformed from 'girl who is hardworking' or 'science girl' to someone who indulges in the sciences, debates about psychology and the economy, and loves to swing and salsa dance. As I form a slip knot and cast on, I'm at home.My home is a dynamic and eclectic entity. Although I've lived in the same house in Cary, North Carolina for 10 years, I have found and carved homes and communities that are filled with and enriched by tradition, artists, researchers, and intellectuals. While I may not always live within a 5 mile radius of a Bojangle's or in close proximity to Lab 304, learning to become a more perceptive daughter and sister, to share the beauty of my heritage, and to take risks and redefine scientific and personal expectations will continue to impact my sense of home.",,,

The bottle-blond cashier\u2014Erica, her nametag reads\u2014huffs impatiently and examines her scarlet nails. Behind us is a line of grumbling customers, shifting from one foot to the other, annoyance emanating from every pore. I observe all of this in shamed silence, arms crossed as if it would protect me from the accusing stares. The cause of the turmoil? The colorful pieces of paper lying innocuously on the cashier's scanner\u2014coupons.When I was younger, about 12 or 13 years old (the awkward years), the shame burned a hole in my chest. I couldn't look anyone in the eyes, I bit my lip until I tasted iron, and I prayed to any and all deities that the transaction would be quick and manager-free. Sometimes I wanted to sink into the ground. Other times I cowardly abandoned my mom for the magazine aisle, a smiling Zac Efron a welcome respite from the judgmental stares. I didn't want to be attached to the stereotype: the petite, Asian woman, trying to discount already discounted items, haggling with the customer service representative in broken English. I was jealous of my friends who threw bags of chips into their carts without looking at the price, grabbing only one jar of salsa even though it was buy-one-get- one-free. Their parents didn't even look at the receipt\u2014just handed over their credit card.I used to resent how I could never do something without caring about the price, how I could never attend birthday parties or socials. I was ashamed of my image, my heritage, my background. But as the years went on, and as I matured, I grew to realize that it was unfair to both my mom and myself to feel that way. Shame, embarrassment and guilt\u2014how could I feel this way? When all my mother did was try her hardest to make me happy\u2014saving money so we could afford a nice house, quality clothes, healthy food\u2014how could I resent her? I began to see my mother in a new light. I saw her resourcefulness in finding ways to save money in all parts of our budget. I saw her determination and fortitude when she returned from work with bloodshot eyes and the stale scent of cigarettes sticking to her Hard Rock Casino uniform. I saw her optimism when she smiled everyday despite her struggles.Instead of seeing weakness, I saw strength. I resolved to be more like my mother\u2014and to become a role model for others. I aspired to be resourceful, determined, optimistic, and strong in the face of opposition or judgment.Those revelations have carried me to this day. I thought of my mother's strength and determination at her casino job when it was 2 am and I still wasn't done with homework. I thought of my mother's resourcefulness with coupons when I tried to find ways to go to summer camps I could never afford otherwise. I thought of my mother's optimism and can-do attitude when it seemed like I could never pull off a successful open-mic night on the first day of summer; when school was the last place anyone would want to go. My mother's lessons have carried me to success thus far. I got through a brutal junior year with stellar grades and a strong SAT score. I received a full scholarship to attend a summer program for art. The open-mic night was a smash success, with tons of students attending and sharing their talents, stories, poems, and dreams.I went to Publix with my mom today. She still uses coupons. Yet, rather than running away like I did when I was thirteen years old, I stood tall, looked the cashier in the eyes, made small talk with the bagger, and held my mom's purse as she sorted through her coupon book.",,,
194,Admitsee,4,1,,3,,5,,"The first time I went to the symphony\u2014Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet\u2014by myself, I took the essentials: my phone to communicate with my parents, my water bottle to stay hydrated, and The Fountainhead to keep anyone from wanting to talk to me.Despite being packed full of well-dressed adults, Benaroya Hall seemed cavernous when I went alone. I found my seat, opened my book, and pretended to be riveted by the concept of hating poor people for being poor. As the audience filtered into the hall, I shrank deeper into my chair and read a bit harder, trying not to make eye contact or take up my neighbors' armrest space. But as the lights dimmed, the orchestra tuned, and the conductor strode onstage, I relaxed, my fear of seeming out of place forgotten.I can go to symphonies thanks to TeenTix, a Seattle nonprofit that promotes youth arts engagement by allowing teens to buy $5 tickets to almost every art venue\u2014visual, musical, theatrical, and movement-based\u2014in the city. It was my TeenTix pass that allowed me to go to that first symphony concert alone. But even though I relished the experience, I couldn't help feeling like my cheaper ticket meant I deserved my seat less than the full-paying, real-collared-shirt-wearing grownups around me.Since my first symphony concert, I've used my TeenTix pass to see everything from Mozart operas to a play about growing up as a queer Latino. I wish I could say that first concert experience gave me all the confidence I needed. The truth was, my desire to see shows was always greater than my fear of sticking out, so I bit back my insecurities and went anyway.With each new ticket stub I've collected, I've become more secure in the idea that I\u2014and all teens\u2014deserve to see art as much as adults. That's why I joined TeenTix's leadership board: to help make arts access possible for teens who might otherwise never consider going to a gallery or theater.Realizing that everyone deserves to see art regardless of their status is one thing; believing everyone has the power to create art is another. However, I've been working on that, too. I've done improv comedy for four years, and though it requires no set, script, or costumes, I'd always assumed producing shows was best left to adults. But when my improv group wanted to perform more often than adults could help us with, I produced an improvised episode of the TV show Survivor on my own. It drew an enthusiastic and (paying!) audience. I'm working on the next installment, which will be performed at a tiny independent theatre in December. I want to blur the line between adults and teens in the arts\u2014on and off the stage\u2014by moving into territory that has traditionally been thought to be for grown-ups.I won't be a teen much longer and, sadly, I don't think AdultTix exists (yet). For now, I'm relishing the sight of my worn jeans in plush symphony seats and the sound of improv audiences yelling suggestions at the stage. And when I leave Seattle to become a full-fledged, collared-shirt wearing adult, I hope to bring that arts accessibility to the teens in the next city I call home.The last time I went to the opera\u2014Puccini's Madame Butterfly\u2014by myself, I took the essentials: my phone and water bottle, but not The Fountainhead. Despite the looks from the affluent, homogenous audience gathered to hear the pre-show lecture, I matter-of-factly stepped into the hall and took my seat. As the lecturer began, the lady next to me leaned over and whispered, 'What exactly is a verismo opera?'I leaned over and whispered, 'I have absolutely no idea.' Then I settled back and got comfortable, my elbow on my armrest.",,,

Whenever the priest finished his poetic accounts, I struggled with confusion that had nothing to do with my language skills. 'How were humans created? Why did the creators make us?' I asked. 'At the beginning of time, Brahma, the God of creation, split his body to make men and women. He created us out of his own image.' With that, he began the next hymn, leaving me more bewildered than before.As I grew older, the more I thought about the legitimacy and foundations of my religion, the more uncertainty I would find. The incredible legends seemed to defy every fundamental measure of science and mathematics, throwing the big bang theory out the window, not to mention basic conservation of matter. Even my grandmother's unshakeable faith and counsel failed to renew my faith. My responses to friends' occasional questions about Hinduism grew increasingly concise, even acquiescing.But the Why? Question remained incessant. I read Heller, Tagore, and finally Vonnegut, who wrote: 'Tiger got to sleep. Bird got to land. Man got to tell himself he understand.' The words slapped me across the face. I realized I had been desperately searching for my purpose through faith in a religion of fantastical, fictional fables that I knew, deep in my heart, couldn't be true. Oh, puny Hindu, Vonnegut whispered to me. You're one of billions on this little planet, and of billions before you. They all come, and they all go. What makes you think you matter?And so, in my spiritual distress, I returned to the physical setting of my internal conflict, a place, I had visited seldom since childhood: our Hindu temple. The statues and murals, still alluringly beautiful, offered no consolation. Finally, in a moment of salvational serendipity I realized what I had been missing the whole time: the people on the carpets around me. Family, friends, neighbors, even strangers. We sat separately, but prayed in harmony and sacred unity.Maybe, Vonnegut was both right and wrong. Correct, perhaps, in his assessment that life may not have a concrete, comprehensible purpose, but incorrect in failing to see the meaning within the search itself. Religion is a manifestation of this search - its importance does not lie in its accuracy, but rather in its ability to unify and bring meaning.What Vonnegut and my fellow Hindus helped me realize was that our search for purpose may be the very thing that proves the presence of meaning in life. We search together in spiritual fellowship; that we search proves there is something to search for. This journey that we all share qualifies itself. There is no final answer, there is only this great process, one that we are all bound to in life.Today, I am religious, but my faith is not just a Hindu one. It is a faith in my fellow man, a faith in love, and a faith in the necessity my lifelong question: Why?So, somewhat ironically in the words of Vonnegut: 'Live by the harmless untruths that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy.' These untruths, then, are those that bring us together.And, just as it was written thousands of years ago in the Hindu Vedas:The experience of unityis the fulfillment of human endeavors.The mysteries of life are revealed.",,,
198,Admitsee,4,1,,3,,,6,"My religious and intellectual journey thus far, much like my ancient ancestors' wanderings through the wilderness,has been both painful and revelatory. Growing up, I attended an ultra-Orthodox high school, or Yeshiva, where Iwould study Talmud for upwards of six hours a day and was strongly discouraged from engaging with anyperspectives outside of Orthodox Judaism. There, as a devoted student eager to spend my days immersed in theholy and exhilarating wonders of the Talmud, I thrived. At the time, the notion that we need not and should notengage with any perspectives outside of our tradition made utmost sense to me; after all, why engage with othersif only we possess the divine, unadulterated truth?With that orientation, I set out after high school to an ultra-Orthodox seminary in Israel to continue my religiousstudies in a similarly sheltered environment. There, I spent my days exploring the breadth and depth of the Jewishtradition and developed a profound, religious passion for Judaism. However, over the ensuing months and years, Ifound that the more I engaged with the religion that was so dear to my heart, the less capable I became ofmaintaining my faith. As my studies progressed, biblical criticism loomed like a serpent threatening to swallow thecore of who I was and searing moral and ethical problems posed by Judaism's sacred texts and laws plagued mymind and conscience.Eventually, the burden of these unrelenting doubts forced me to venture out of my mini-universe on a quest foranswers. I began to explore a broad array of liberal and progressive Jewish thinkers who had been off-limits to mein my youth, including Abraham Joshua Heschel, Franz Rosenzweig, and Mordecai Kaplan. Ultimately, thisexploration led me to embrace a more open-minded and pluralistic vision of religion that recognizes the findings ofmodern scholarship, is fully committed to engaging with varying and divergent perspectives, and does not claim amonopoly on truth or wisdom.Now, still passionate about Judaism, I long to continue my Jewish studies in a world class academic environmentdevoted to critical, intellectual pursuit. However, my current academic home, Lander College for Men, is a JewishOrthodox institution and only offers Jewish studies courses from a prescribed traditional perspective.Additionally, to reach my full potential as a student and person, I now long to wrestle with not only Judaism's bigideas, but also with the broader, vast, and magnificent expanse of human moral, political, and religious thought. Iyearn to study ethics and political philosophy, examine major world religions, and explore the literature, history,and beliefs of cultures and traditions that are presently wholly foreign to me. However, Lander College is primarilyfocused on preparing students for specific professional careers such as Medicine, Law, and Accounting and doesnot offer a wide selection of courses in the liberal arts or humanities.Finally, having come to realize the immeasurable value of engaging with a multiplicity of perspectives, I now cravea diverse academic and social environment where I can broaden and sharpen my own point of view. I hope tolearn from peers and teachers of varying backgrounds, identities, and religious and political orientations. However,at Lander College, as the entire student body and much of the faculty are male, Orthodox Jews, I feel that therange of perspectives with which I can engage is inherently limited.I don't know where my religious and intellectual journey will ultimately take me. However, to continue my journey, Iknow that I need to find a new academic home where I can study broadly and sincerely engage with the rich anddiverse world around me.",,,
199,Admitsee,3,1,,,,5,,"A curly blond haired girl stares up inquisitively, puzzled and perplexed attempting to decipher the odd sounds mouthed from her family members' lips. 'Je t'aime, ma ch\u00e9rie!' 'Que linda! Es una mu\u00f1eca.' 'How cute, she's adorable.' Confusion sets in: she only understands fragments of this conversation. As a three-year-old girl moving from France to Miami, I only spoke and understood French. My inability to communicate landed me in the principal's office the first week of school. My infraction? Pulling other girls' ponytails to finally get my turn on the swings.As my language skills developed, concepts became clearer. I began to understand these foreign conversations and my childhood cloud of confusion was transformed into comprehension, igniting my inquisitiveness. At the daily dinner table, I would relish listening to my father rant about French politics and 'mi abuelo Cubano' cursing Castro and recounting the horrors of my Dutch grandmother's ordeal in a Japanese concentration camp in Indonesia during WWII. These fascinating stories prompted me to ask questions and learn about the historical and cultural traditions of my diverse background. I became entranced and impassioned by history, often researching about D-Day and Normandy to be able to partake in my father's zealous conversations with his friends. These heated discussions taught me to broach controversial topics and participate in intellectually stimulating conversations with people of opposing views. This undoubtedly set the foundation for my venture into debate at school. Whereas in kindergarten my ability to speak French was a hindrance to communicating, now my languages have become an advantage, opening the doors to new and exciting worlds. From deliberately burnt ratatouille to frijoles and platanos, my origins not only allow me to savor the flavors of various cultural cuisines, but also engage in conversations ranging from Nutella crepes and Nouvelle Vague French cinema to Cuban coffee and the Cha-cha-cha. These curious and, at times, comical conversations have taught me to more easily establish deep connections and friendships with persons of varying backgrounds.My cross-cultural identity not only motivated me to learn about my own particular heritage and its struggles, but also made me yearn to discover the plight and intricacies of others around the world. Captivated by culture, I aimlessly stroll the aisles of museums, spending hours absorbing art, artifacts, artists and the history of other nations. Fortunate enough to have traveled to other countries and continents, I have witnessed both the beauty and uniqueness of different societies and conversely, the misery and corruption that plague them. These eye-opening travels coupled with the stories of my family's struggles and my Sacred Heart upbringing have inspired me to serve my school and local community. As a student of the Sacred Heart I have strived to emulate the goal that teaches students to 'commit themselves to develop a social awareness that compels them to action.' These powerful influences have led me to open the Miami Chapter of Students Against Melanoma (in memory of my grandfather), organize Relay for Life, and volunteer as a retreat leader in Campus Ministry. Although my actions may be small and local in nature, I aspire to one day be able to continue my dedication to service on a larger, more global scale. I hope I will be given the opportunity to continue my commitment to service and to share my family's unique history at college. I, likewise, look forward to learning more about other cultures that I have yet to discover and experience. While outsiders may consider my multicultural background what the Cubans call 'un arroz con mango', a confusing combination of ingredients, I prefer to believe and live by the motto coined by William Cowper's poem, 'The Task': 'Variety is the very spice of life, that gives it all its flavor.' Yours truly,Tarina Lily Touret, the 'Fruban' (French-Cuban)",,,
200,Admitsee,2.5,,2,,,5,,"I met Ziva in an unexpected text from my mother. Ziva is a Shepherd mix, she wrote, followed by a photograph of a young dog with wide brown eyes radiating warmth through the latticework of her cage. Caramel- colored eyebrows stood out against her dark coat, her expression permanently surprised, yet friendly.The text came after my mother had discovered Ziva on Facebook. When we squeezed into the small room at the Town of North Hempstead Animal Shelter, Ziva initially hung back in the corner. Eventually, she jumped up to lick my mother's hands, simultaneously crouching and wagging her tail. We adopted her later that week.Once home, Ziva silently lounged in her pillowy bed for days. We wondered what her bark sounded like; soon, she woke up, running from room to room singing in loud whimpers whenever a newcomer came to the door. She broke off her leash several times despite my commands to walk by my side, and I once chased her for three blocks in a foot of snow while she hunted a squirrel. The first time I gave her a bath, I ended up in the tub while she smiled triumphantly from the other side of the bathroom, still dry. She dug holes in the backyard and trampled the flowerbeds of cucumbers and peppers.Ziva was definitely not a perfect dog that people follow on Instagram, who idyllically sit at a dining table eating a steak or pose with sunglasses on a pool raft. I had a lot to teach her. I purchased a book by Cesar Millan and read about the many different methods he used to train dogs. I adopted this inventive approach as I trained Ziva, drawing upon creative skills I never knew I had. When Ziva didn't respond to my first approach of clapping my hands to invite her to meet someone new, I personally introduced her. I stayed by her side with a bone until she felt comfortable enough to independently leave her place beneath the table. I managed to coax her into the bath by feeding her sliced vegetables instead of her regular training- nibblers.As I figure out what her different barks and whines mean, I understand myself and I understand Ziva. She has taught me how to approach problems without a fixed solution. The path I followed training Ziva was never a paved road, allowing me to create my own detours. I apply this mindset to other activities in my life. When I get lost during a run in Alley Pond Park, instead of immediately retracing my steps, I use landmarks to find other routes out.It seems fitting given that Ziva means 'light' in Hebrew. I now approach problems looking for unique resolutions, rather than ruminating about the difficulties or frustrations. When Ziva continued to paw at the door wanting to join us outside during the Eclipse, I placed a pair of solar glasses behind her ears and invited her outside. I captured her, smiling, smelly, in a picture before she shook them off. Ziva may not be a flawless Instagram dog, but she comes close enough for me.",,,
201,Admitsee,3,1,,,,5,6,"On the first Sunday of every month, I skip over to the Baskin-Robbins around the corner. My black hair flows in the wind as I joyously hum Here Comes the Sun. When I enter the ice cream shop, the ding of the bell soothes me while slightly jolting the store clerk behind the tubs of chocolate and milk. With a jump and a glowing smile, I order the same thing as always:'One scoop of vanilla with rainbow sprinkles, please.'Once I receive my order, my eyes gravitate toward the bright colors while my tongue indulges in the sweet, yet starchy, crunch. The oases of reds, blues, and oranges bleed into the vanilla ice cream, creating a symphony of color. Rainbow sprinkles are the stars of the show.My friends say that my love for rainbow sprinkles is a passion fueled by nostalgia. Maybe it is just that. Every time my taste buds are granted the colorful confection, I am transported to when my dad would treat me to ice cream as he sat down with a piece of paper, willing to engage in any topic or question I asked.The first time, I asked my dad to describethe dystopian world of Animal Farm. I watched in awe as my dad quickly scribbled stick figures that vaguely looked like pigs. He smiled sheepishly, apologizing for his creation, but I thought it was a masterpiece. He then detailed with many curvy arrows the intricate connections between Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer. While he exposed the metaphors in the text, a new world opened. Sure, many kids idolize their parents, but I knew my dad was brilliant. In later lessons, my dad would draw diagrams as he told me about the complex plane and how imaginary numbers can coexist in harmony with the numbers I knew so well. Or he wrote Pinyin as he explained the phonetic difference between Shanghainese and Mandarin.For a couple of years, these lessons were simply a way for me to expand my perspective while getting closer to my dad. I longed for our tutorials, quenching my thirst for knowledge and satisfying my hunger for rainbow sprinkles. Out of all of them, though, I had a soft spot for the literature and mathematics lessons. As I sat in algebra one day, the ice-cream lessons transformed into something completely different. The unsolved variable x metamorphosed into a character from a novel. By solving for x, I was going through x's journey. X became Jay Gatsby, Edward Rochester, or Madame Loisel. By making myself more invested in x, what seemed like a mundane task at the time turned into something intriguing. Afterwards, I started to see connections betweenthe rushed brushstrokes in paintings and the equation of work in mechanical physics, between American football formations and historical war strategies. My awe and curiosity grew as I focused on the filaments between fields, seeing the whole world in a new light. By connecting what seemed to be unrelated, my education was no longer a constrained experience, but an immersive one.When I now look at the rainbow sprinkles, I see what I love so much about learning. Each color is a different subject, and when they mix, they make a dazzling rainbow that builds off of every hue. While the sprinkles look different, they all come together, bringing an almost too-good-to-be-true saccharine taste, and that is how I see our world. It may look like it is made of separate entities, but all of them enhance each other cohesively.And that, like taking a bite of vanilla ice cream with rainbow sprinkles, is incredibly satisfying.There's a feeling of euphoria that is irreplaceable. Some get it from making the winning touchdown. Others get it from performing their symphony.Meanwhile, the program I wrote runs on the terminal, and I wait anxiously, hoping that I successfully debugged my code.3...2...1...Let the euphoria begin.As someone who loves solving riddles and problems, coding gives me a rush. I love thinking logically and building algorithms one step at a time. Coding is my own puzzle: by fitting together the right functions, I can create a beautiful picture.I started coding in the Brown Scholars program at the American Museum of Natural History. In the first year, I learned the basics of programming for scientific research. In the next year, I interned at the Exhibitions Department. I noticed during the program how interactive coding truly is. It's not just sitting in front of a computer; it's a collaborative process where everyone chips in to create a final working product. I also learned about the fusion of hardware and software, as I worked with Raspberry Pis and Arduinos to create exhibitions.I've done more than creating exhibits. In my computer science classes in school, including AP and post-AP courses, I built websites and video games from scratch with HTML, Python, CSS, and Processing. I also spent two summers at NYU to hone my Python skills: I learned how to write encryption algorithms at a cybersecurity camp before my junior year and learned how to implement machine learning algorithms to create predictive data models before my senior year. All these experiences, while different in scope, only made me love computer science more. The most irresistible part of coding to me is still that euphoric feeling that rushes through me when my program solves a hard problem. That is irreplaceable.",,,
202,Admitsee,4,1,,,4,,,"As I burst into the house, I could smell that she had already started to saut\u00e9 the onions; I was late. I rushed into the kitchen \u2013 after forcefully tossing my knapsack in my bedroom\u2014and assumed my place: three marble tiles away from my mother. No words were exchanged as I stood and chiffonaded the basil. My mother probably wanted her silence to echo the fact that my tardiness was unacceptable. After all, we had an unspoken agreement to be home at 5 PM sharp to cook the curry.This weekly tradition has gone on ever since I could muster up the strength to grind spices with a mortar and pestle. The smells of turmeric and curry powder flood the air every Monday night and always find a way to nuzzle themselves into the fibers of my cotton dress shirts. Sure, the pungent aroma may deviate from the other Tide-scented apparel in the hallway, but to me, it is a symbol of the innate bond my mother and I share.As I sprinkled the basil onto the slightly charred onions, I grabbed a handful of green chilies and began finely chopping them. At that moment, it dawned on me that I had forgotten to show my mother the reason as to why I was fifteen minutes late. I ran back upstairs, dumped my knapsack onto my bed, and rummaged through its contents. Sufficiently out of breath, I returned to place fresh saffron on the countertop. My mother, having forgotten her glasses, held it close to her face as she examined the crimson red strings of the spice. Almost instantly, she began tearing up. With eyes watering, she looked at me and explained that growing up in the slums of Sri Lanka, she could only dream of affording such a luxury.At ten years old, my mother was tasked with the job of cooking meals for her entire family. She walked two miles in the scorching heat, wading through serpent-infested waters, to pick a handful of mallum (greens), five sardines, and two red chilies.Looking back on that night, I understand why my mother cried. I had always thought of her as an adult when in truth, she too is someone's child. At some point in her life, she was also seventeen, but instead of applying to universities, her daily routine consisted of embarking on a treacherous journey to put food on the table. Her hard work and bravery are the reasons why I've been able to experience life as I have, and I aspire to develop my own sense of courage to one day match hers.Earlier last year, my aspiration was put to the test. My high school was rocked by several sexual assault cases, which left our student body divided. Someone had asserted that these issues stemmed from the fact that our administrators accepted minority children \u2013like me\u2014without \\\u2018screening' properly. I tried to bite my tongue, but as I smelled my dress shirt, smelled the heritage of my mother and her resilience, I knew that something had to be said. So, I spoke out.I spoke for every student who felt threatened by the school culture that was rapidly growing more antagonistic towards them \u2014who was suddenly self-conscious that they reeked of their ethnicity\u2014and told them we were not the problem.The ability and ease my first world status brings is one that will no longer be taken for granted. My mother's story will continue to linger in me throughout university and beyond, even after the hint of spices has left my cotton shirts. As I continue to cook on my own, I will continually be reminded of the love of my mother, the will of my parents, and my ability to use the bravery I derive from them to rise above any obstacles the future may bring.",,,

206,Admitsee,4,1,2,,,5,,"Thorny, pungent, unbecoming \u2013 you wouldn't be wrong to describe the jagged fruit as such. Misunderstood, full of surprises \u2013 these descriptions also hold true. Most people staunchly refuse to eat the durian, but you only need to give it a chance. I, however, am obsessed with it \u2013 not only because of its nostalgic taste but also because oddly, the \\\u2018king of fruit' and I share much in common.One day, when I was twelve and home alone, I caught a familiar whiff. Despite being cocooned in layers of red plastic, I still located the durian. I wanted it.Armed with a bread knife, I confronted the brutish fruit. As I resolutely hacked away at its spiky, enigma-like shell, I suddenly spotted star-like notches on the durian's base. Aha! Using them as my guide, I cut lengthwise to remove the unsightly greenish membrane, revealing nutritious jewels of flesh inside. I had successfully pried my first durian open at the tender age of twelve. I ate every mouthful of creamy sweetness and bold tanginess with gusto. Ah, how gratifying it was to reap the fruit of my labor!When my parents came home, they were shocked to find their girl with durian oozing between her fingers, and bemused at how I \u2013 a demure and slight girl \u2013 had managed to best this \\\u2018king of fruit' even they dared not challenge.I was never a David to the Goliath of durians. Growing up around the Chinese social ideal of being subdued and deferential, I never considered myself to be especially courageous. I do, however, have grit. Just like the durian, I am bold in flavor.My grit may have led to some foolish endeavors, but it also led to my joining Model United Nations in middle school.Stumbling into the first meeting, I was overwhelmed by the verbal-dueling wordsmiths around me. How could I compete with them? Nonetheless, my steely determination prevented me from quitting. My voice, initially timid, gradually gave way to confidence. Deviating from the Chinese mindset of collective consciousness, I embraced the thrill of passionately voicing my own opinions in a safe space. I even won Most Improved Delegate awards.Some people assume I have no thoughts simply because I refrain from announcing them loudly in class. Our school, much like Western society, celebrates extroverted students who readily speak their mind. One day, I finally felt understood after stumbling upon Susan Cain's TED Talk, where she championed the power of introverts. I have since embraced my strength in listening to my peers.I eventually mustered the courage to try team sports for the first time. It came as a surprise to me, though, when I became an avid softball player in high school. I assumed that introverts were incompatible with team sports. However, I soon realized that team sports also require individual focus. I spent hours, alone, perfecting the precise movements of throwing the ball. Yet our team is driven by a collective spirit of 'guts over fear'. On the field, we stealthily lock eyes, signaling to one another with the slightest nod. In this manner, a quiet synergy spreads across the field.My stoic exterior allows me, drenched in sweat, to bear the 100-degree heat and analyze the next play. And when my team celebrates a home run or dive catch, I am also the one who exudes sweet, enduring joy.I am more than just a quiet person, just as there is more to a durian than its prickly shell. Passionate about international politics, I advocate for justice. Intrigued by economics, I contentedly pore over books and seek to understand the societal forces at work. There is more to me than meets the eye. My ear for listening and my eye for detail are the weapons I use to face challenges. Despite my cool exterior, I am a bold blend of gritty confidence.I find solace in the kitchen. Having a tranquil space to push and explore the boundaries of food draws me to cooking: from Chinese nian gao rice cakes to fusion black sesame brownies, I cherish every opportunity to experiment with bold new ideas.Growing up around the Chinese social ideal of quiet deference, I never considered myself as fearless. Yet to my family and friends, I was always the ambitious girl who relentlessly experimented with new ideas whenever inspiration struck. While quiet, I have a gritty determination to accomplish tasks once I set my mind to it.In middle school, I walked into my first\u00adever Model UN meeting. Initially, I doubted myself, but my timid voice gradually gave way to confidence. I embraced the thrill of combining ideas to voice my opinions compellingly, just as I had experimented with original flavors in my cooking. Surprisingly, I won a Most Improved Delegate award in my first year. My eyes opened to the world of intensely competitive MUN. I found my talent in debating, driven by my love for the art of rhetoric.Five years later, I still thrive amidst the intense dueling between opposing ideas.

207,Admitsee,3.5,,,,,,6,"C-I-R-S-U-S\u2026 that's simple,' I confidently thought to myself. I spelled my first word of the class spelling bee aloud to my first grade teacher. Next thing I knew, a dreadful 'ting'rang out: the sound of elimination. She seemed amused by my misstep: 'Circus is spelled with a \\\u2018c,' not an \\\u2018s'.' Channeling my frustration into an icy determination to win next year's bee, I studied obsessively. Armed with each one of Merriam-Webster's 1557 pages, I fought for my redemption. As I tightly clutched my flimsy 1st place certificate, I felt like my efforts had been validated.For me, winning was exhilarating, but not enough \u2014 I had to be better no matter what. My desire to constantly improve was almost compulsive. My high standards drove me to sports where I didn't have to depend on teammates that could fail me: chess, tennis, and swimming. I even played basketball alone; I spent hours at a neighborhood hoop tirelessly working to sink as many consecutive three-pointers as I could. Every shot had to be perfect. But, I was a solo performer, and shouldering this enormous burden alone took a toll.In fifth grade, my love for science and fast-paced competitions led me to Science Bowl. But there was one caveat: I had teammates. Wary of working with others, I tried to become my own team, memorizing as much as I could about every subject. However, one question soon revealed the flaw in my approach: 'Which of the following is true of the mantle?' Even though I wasn't sure of the answer, I impulsively slammed down on the red button and guessed. Rather than let my teammates, who may have known the answer, buzz, I had to determine the outcome.My fatal buzz ended the match. Costing not only myself, but also my team, the competition felt horrible. I couldn't actually master physics and chemistry and biology and astronomy by myself. Initially, I distanced myself entirely from Science Bowl; however, a few days later, I guiltily faced my teammates. The consequences of my individual failure made me realize that, to win, I had to work with others and trust my teammates.Science Bowl showed me that winning required teamwork, but I still saw collaboration as just a way to win.However, researching at a biomedical engineering and physics lab in my junior year completely transformed my perspective. My first few interactions with my fellow interns were cringeworthy, filled with awkward silences and meaningless pleasantries. However, one day, a supplies shortage forced us to devise our own experimental apparatus with my iPhone and a selfie-stick. I discovered something much greater than the scientific uses of selfie-sticks that week \u2014 I discovered how much true collaboration matters. To celebrate our success, we trekked to 'Speedy Street Tacos,' a nearbytaco stand that became our daily lunch spot. Discussing everything from our ideas for optimizing super-hydrophilicity to Makoyi's (in)ability to woo women bridged our differences in age and experience. Once we became friends, our work was so much better, and we had fun doing it. We would have never succeeded as much as we did without our camaraderie. Ultimately, I've grown to embrace that life's a circus \u2014 a crazy show filled with failures and mistakes that make it uniquely mine. Despite what that second grade spelling bee champ thought, winning isn't everything. Chatting at a roadside taco stand creates something greater than any certificate or win. Succeeding, truly succeeding, isn't possible solo. I can't answer every question, I can't research everything (at least now, I usually spell everything correctly). I still want to win \u2014 to strive for perfection \u2014 but I now know that I'll always have help in getting there.My 'cirsus' will always be a little imperfect, but with all the things we're juggling, I know it's my fellow performers that will be there to help make it a great show.My love for science and fast-paced competitions led me to Science Bowl. But there was one caveat: I had teammates. We all memorized as much as we could about every subject without communicating. However, our first tournament soon revealed the flaw in our approach: rather than deferring to other teammates, who were more knowledgeable on the topic, we all raced to slam down on the red button.This strategy cost us many matches and, initially, our team grew apart. However, a few days later, I guiltily called a team meeting. To win, we had to trust each other. As captain, I made study plans for my teammates, so that we could become specialists in our respective subjects and rely on each other to win. Science Bowl showed me that leaders can't succeed on their own. But it wasn't until I started researching at a biomedical engineering and physics lab in my junior year that I saw collaboration as more than just a means to win. My first few interactions with my fellow interns were cringeworthy, filled with awkward silences and meaningless pleasantries. However, one day, a supplies shortage forced us to devise our own experimental apparatus. Armed with my iPhone and a selfie-stick, I led the efforts to build a surface energy measurement tool. That week, I discovered something much greater than the scientific uses of selfie-sticks \u2014 I discovered how much true collaboration matters for its own sake. For the rest of the summer, I embraced my role as part of this new team by writing papers and grants, and leading the research and development on our microliter blood analysis technique called HemaDrop.My experiences in Science Bowl and research have transformed me from a leader who saw teamwork as a means to an end to someone who truly appreciates the value of working as a team. Every day, my new perspective on what it means to be a leader allows me to be a better researcher, team captain, and ultimately a student who can contribute meaningfully to his community.I view humor as one of my greatest talents -- not because I'm that hilarious, but because of how it connects me with others. I employ humor to build upon existing relationships and forge new ones. It is my way of bringing out the best in myself and others is through humor.Humor has even found its way into my Organic Chemistry class, where our primary language isn't English or chemical nomenclature -- it's nonsensical inside jokes. We chuckle at tert-butyl alkyl groups, even creating the substituent with our arms. Contrary to what you might think, these inside jokes do not hinder learning. Instead, they enhance it. For instance, when I'm taking a test and a 'terty' butyl is attached to a cyclic alkene, all of the jokes we cracked flood my memory, and I can immediately identify the compound. 'Boring' material becomes entertaining. My passion comes through when I explain concepts to my classmates or the younger children I tutor when I use amusing acronyms and mnemonics. Humor reminds me and those around me that work and fun aren't mutually exclusive. And fun actually makes work a lot more effective. My jokes go beyond reinforcing learning. However superficial, they create moments that deepen my bonds with others. When I see a classmate after a tough day, we can always grin by making a tert-butyl with our arms. During junior year, I wanted to be able to expand that by writing a mock-advice column, entitled Yash-ip Girl (yup, a synthesis of my name and Gossip Girl), in our school newspaper. After a somewhat rocky start, my audience grew wider, and hilarious questions began filling up my inbox. Students and teachers alike still often stop me in the hallways by yelling my pseudonym and referencing some ridiculous line from the column (for instance, advice on 'balling') that made them laugh. I love how humor allows people to bond over shared experiences and truly enjoy the work we do. I view humor as an essential part of myself, like a bone in my arm. Now isn't that humerus?The two staples of our AP Physics C class were the deep baritone voice of our beloved teacher, Mr. Mac and a poster that read, 'Formulas are for babies.' Before AP Physics C, I viewed physics as just another subject -- another class where I had to do some practice problems, read the textbook, and take tests. I enjoyed solving problems, but I studied superficially by memorizing solutions instead of understanding how to approach any problem. I developed my ability to actually solve problems instead of simply regurgitating solutions. And it was beautiful. AP Physics C taught me more than just mechanics, electricity, and magnetism, but how to study and approach everyday problems more meaningfully. Physics quickly became one my passions even outside of the classroom.Armed with my new appreciation, I joined my school's Physics Club and prepared for the U.S. Physics Olympiad Exam, on which I earned semifinalist honors. Challenging myself every Tuesday to understand new, abstract concepts about Modern Physics and attempt difficult problems was liberating -- I reveled in the systematic approach I took to solve problems.My love for physics deepened when I started pursuing research as a junior. As I learned about Quantum Mechanics in the classroom, I saw the real life applications in the lab -- for instance, we had talked about using an ion beam to excite electrons, and I had the chance to work with a particle accelerator weekly! Along what I learned in my physics classes, my experiences in biomedical engineering research intricately related physics to biology, another one of my passions. In fact, the most interesting and complex physical system to understand is the human body. Whether it's Bernoulli's principle governing the flow of blood through the heart or mechanical stress determining the optimal composition of prosthetics, solving problems -- like microliter blood analysis -- at the intersection of physics and biology is extremely impactful and intellectually stimulating. Ultimately, physics has provided me with crucial problem-solving abilities that I use in all aspects of my life. I now aspire to solve problems at the intersection of biology and engineering with biomedical engineering.",,,

209,Admitsee,4.5,1,2,3,,,,"6:57 A.M. Bright lights illuminate the train tracks towering above me. Leaving all uncertainties behind, I sprint toward the train, with homemade morning coffee exploding onto my shirt. Just as I reach the yellow stoop of the stairs, the gears of the train screech as it comes to a halt. 'This is a Manhattan Bound F Local Train; the next stop is Kings Highway. Stand clear of the closing doors, please.' The two and a half seconds between this infamous announcement and the movement of the doors gives me just enough time to slip onboard, panting but rejoicing.Last night wreaked havoc. Sounds of pounding and screaming inflicted by my mother are silenced by the murmur of the train's engine. Finally at ease, I can now create stern order from the unbridled chaos that encompasses my life. Maneuvering my frame through the densely packed car, I embark on my journey, my meticulous routine designed to help me escape the instability of my home. A familiar sight surrounds me: hurried men in tailored business suits circled by homeless nomads sleeping under the train's inextinguishable fluorescent light. A family performs a string quartet, transforming the train car into Carnegie Hall and drawing both smiles and dangerous scowls from the audience. Prayers of the Torah captivate a young boy wearing a kippah. Next to him, an elderly Vietnamese couple indulges in a scrumptious dish of pho. With every stop the train makes further from home, I tighten my grip on authoritative control over my being. 8:43 A.M. In a flustered frenzy, I exit the train and flutter towards my first destination, using my designated path to reach the doorstep of my rhythmic gymnastics school. I calculate that I will have exactly seven minutes to roll away the carpets and wooden ballet barres at gymnastics and take the Q train to tutor on the other side of town. Every moment effortlessly falls into place onto the endlessly circulating conveyor belt of my existence. 7:16 P.M. Hopping on board the train once more, I find safety and refuge in mimicking the train conductor announcing the next stop and calculating time intervals between train stops. I revel in my routine, equating change with rampant destruction.9:30 P.M. Sliding through the rusted metal turnstile, I numbly direct my body towards the place where my routine holds no power: home. I pray that my key still fits the lock. I hope to find my things where I left them that morning and not scattered, destroyed, or discarded after one of my mother's torturous scavenger hunts. My mother's abuse inflicts more than just physical pain. It disrupts my routine and, therefore, my sanity. My home is the epicenter of instability. Its tensions confine me to a world of vulnerability and uncertainty, of restraints that I cannot ever imagine being liberated from. My routine, embodied by my time on the train, comforts and shelters me from the otherwise unbearable fluctuations permeating my life.Now, I learn to make a routine of new endeavors and experiences, accepting the ever-changing nature of my world. Habit and routine have no say in my pattern of living. I resist the structure that once consumed me. No longer hiding behind the confines of monotony, I free my creative spirit and fill my world with spontaneity. The admirable beauty of my conventional train ride lies not in its static image but its continual evolution and journey forward. In defiance of all constraints imposed by my mother, I fearlessly progress into a world of uncertainty, unraveling the tight grip once held on my existence. Like my train rides, I am set abound by possibility. I am eternally dynamic. I refuse stability and ambitiously venture toward unfamiliar territory.",,,
210,Admitsee,4,1,,3,,,,"The piano plays a blues-like arpeggio, pentatonic notes ascending until G#7. My fellow choir members and I begin to sing our second song, 'Music Down in my Soul,' for the spiritual category in the Golden Gate International Choir Festival. The piano dramatizes its notes over the line 'Over my head' as we slowly bring our hands mid-body to groove. Suddenly, the piano accelerates into an upbeat gospel and we cry, 'I got this music down in my soul! And it feels my heart with the joy of the Lord!' In our red pouf dresses (and one 'waiter' boy), we sway vigorously, like palm trees in a windy March afternoon in LA. Our swelling hearts revealed jubilation through our dynamic melodies, huge smiles, and dancing bodies. I myself felt a fire spread throughout my body that impelled me to perform dramatically. 'Music Down in my Soul' elevated my understanding of African-American trauma during the time of Southern slavery; the emotional gestures highlight my connection to the historical community. When we sang 'Over my head, I hear music in the air,' I understood the analogy between God and music; through God, African-American slaves believed they were free, and music, at this point, was their only salvation. They reaffirm this point again with 'There must be a God somewhere\/Over my head, I feel singing in the air.' Choral music thus exposes me to personal and global stories and links me to another person or community intuitively, fortifying my empathy for humanity. Choir taught me that storytelling illuminates universal truths. These truths reveal the nuances of human experience from grief to love. Personal stories of injustice especially aggravate me; the obstructions due to power and prejudice placed on the marginalized prevents them from simply living. When I first read 'Emily Doe's' testimony, I was angry. I was disappointed by the judge's partiality to Brock Turner, who had clearly violated 'Emily Doe'; disappointed by the judge's inability to sympathize with her trauma, and most of all, disappointed by the justice system's failure to protect the victim, the person that the system had promised to protect. Driven by my sense of unfairness in 'Emily Doe's' situation, I raised awareness on sexual violence in my local community by leading discussions about sexual violence through a club on my high school campus, Amnesty International, and fundraising for Thorn, a nonprofit that fights sex trafficking through technology. In doing so, I hope to prevent people falling victim to sexual violence, and fight for the liberation of those who are victims. Through understanding universal revelations in stories, I am motivated to fight for the betterment of humanity's conditions.Of course, I advocate for myself and my many identities. I am part of many communities with their own unique stories. I am a Filipino American, an ethnic minority with stories of colonization and discrimination in its collective psyche. I am a member of the LGBT community where stories of repression of true love and true expression endure in the fight for visibility. I am a Gen Zer, an emerging generation with humorous relatable stories and a readiness to defend the future. I am a poet, a construer of language the discloses my letter to the world. I am a scholar, one who observes the stories of the world to discern their wisdom for the future. Beyond all, I am a citizen of the world whose connection with innumerable peoples propels me to be in emotional unity with unknown narratives. Without my choral experiences, I would have never arrived to the conclusion of storytelling as testimony to truth. Songs of different traditions and travels to foreign places to sing with choirs around the world only strengthen my argument. Because of choir, I am an activist motivated by others' stories to campaign for justice.Immaculate Heart of Mary Children's Choir has been my second family since 4th grade. My choral director Mr. A jokingly once said that I sounded like a 'roach' at first. Yet, he saw my potential for growth and permitted me to join the choir's rich history. I was first a Soprano 2 weakling who competed in the World Choir Games and won two silver medals in the children's choir and spiritual categories. The next year I traveled to Eugene, Oregon to sing at the Pacific International Children's Choir Festival. The festival's choral director Mr. Henry Leck taught me singing techniques that metamorphized me from a roach to a butterfly. After, Mr. A moved me to alto 2. Because of my powerful heavy voice, I became a leading figure in the group, being responsible for knowing the alto parts and mentoring younger newcomers.As an alto, I became important in numerous choral events. In 2015, the choir competed at the Golden Gate Festival wherein the group placed 3rd in the African-American spiritual category. In 2016, we sang at the National Children's Choir Festival at Carnegie Hall. Though an elementary school choir, I still was a part of it despite graduating from middle school. In high school, we maintained some choral traditions like singing at the LA County Fair every Christmas Eve and at Disney CA Adventure. We also sang at a Bishops awards ceremony and opened for a new Filipino choir at Walt Disney Hall. Recently the choir sang at Canterbury Cathedral in England for the International Children's Choir Festival. In all events, my alto voice held the three-part harmonies together and assured that the pitch was still correct. Instead of being a 'roach,' I was the choir's anchor because of my ability to lead other choral members to succeed in performance with my thunderous singing.My dedication to my choir has led to me achieving a top role within the group. Because of this role, I have strengthened the choir's reputation. I thus have achieved excellence and self-fulfillment. Now, I am ready to utilize my initiative as a future leader.",,,

I furrow my eyebrows knowing I have to continue tomorrow but smile again as I realize the frontseat is empty. Excited that Mr. Kamani will continue his eternal lesson of teaching me how to drive, I run happilyand get into the old van.That's one of my earliest memories as a child when I took on a great \\\u2018challenge'- finding the biggest number in theworld. I had a small notebook where I jotted down the endless numbers, soon after learning about them. Devoted,I would stand by the street in the morning waiting for the school van as I performed my complex calculations. Afew weeks later, I realized I was looking for something \\\u2018abstract'- infinity, or at least that was what I was told. Everytime I recall this, I smile. The amused feeling comes and goes but one question remains. Is there really infinity?Man decided to label that which he cannot reach: that which he cannot seem to comprehend. Because there wasno limit, we created our own limit and called it infinity. We masked this with a simple definition: impossible tocount- never to be attained. It's our nature to try to make concepts more logical since such \\\u2018maximums' are theunderlying features of our society. There are things you just can't do, they say. Why? Because it's impossible.Why is it impossible? Because there's a limit to everything.Is there?Grounded on such \\\u2018rules' for as long as I can remember, I couldn't possibly imagine straying from pre-determinedpaths. Crushing any fantasies of deviation, I explored what was expected of me. After all, I was staying within thelimits since anything drastically different should not be attained. I had a perfect plan and expected it to dictate mylife. Work hard. Pass my finals. Get into medical school- a seemingly sole desire in my society. Be a successfuldoctor. Make everyone happy. Nothing could go wrong in my plan right?Right.Then I joined Secondary school. Exposed to so many things that I would have otherwise overlooked, I began toquestion the viability of \\\u2018limits'. My interests started to grow and my bubble formed lines of weakness. I dared tostay at the music room occasionally; the pull too strong to ignore. I dared to believe I could change the countrywith my new interest in waste management. The unusual attraction to music and science drew me in- a uniondefying infinity. Gradually, infinity became less abstract. Something that wasn't expected to be attained becamedefined.When I started to play the drums, a foreign sense of tranquility and belonging overcame me. Indeed, musicopened the cork that had previously locked in my ambitions. I was no longer scared of a heart I couldn't silence. Aheart filled with as many fears as ambitions that longed to be set free. For in reality, infinity diminishes the abyss ofuncertainty by falsely assuring you of a point where things are impossible. Music made my infinity more tangibleand borders non-existent. It made me get in touch with my inner child and finally, I resumed my challenge- Icontinued in search of a concrete type of infinity. An infinity where I dream of the \\\u2018impossible'- never to be attained;a dream where I can make a difference. In the midst of trillions, billions, millions, thousands and hundreds, there'sa central equation: music plus science equals discredited infinity.",,,

214,Admitsee,3.5,,,3,,5,6,"Finish your drink!'I was on a bus ride back to Vancouver on a hot summer's day, and seated to my left was a very bothersome child who would not refrain from nit-picking at my every action - from how I was sitting (with my knee up to the front seat) to whether I finished my Starbucks (it was done, half the cup was ice) before standing up to throw it away.'I don't want to,' I replied with a forced smile.'I won't get up unless you finish it. You are being a bad person.'I gave the woman to my right, this kid's mom, a look which she returned with a meek, apologetic smile. While I was trying my best to ignore this child, I was also reading a very philosophical teen romance book and had just come across these lines: 'Look around. All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.' Upon reading that quote I looked more carefully at the pair on either side of me, heart racing, and I noticed the mother looked worn; her beauty was marked with dark circles around her eyes and choppy, unkempt, hay-colored hair.'I know how you feel,' she whispered to me, 'Don't worry, we're getting off at the next stop.'I suddenly realized the reason behind the child's behavior. I felt ashamed and selfish, and that very \\\u2018core value' I repeated in my expensive private school every week, empathy, was lost to me. Feeling a mix of embarrassment and pity, I quickly turned back to my book, sucking the cold air out of my cup. I took this bus route often enough. I happened to know the next stop was the Vancouver Autism Clinic.They say our eyes are equivalent to 480-megapixel cameras. The idea that a simple organ can have such a pivotal influence on us is extraordinary to me. What is more remarkable, though, is that if we aren't genuinely looking, we miss out on more than just 480-megapixel pictures. We miss out on life itself. Sure, athletics and academics are important, but the ability to empathize with others, to create meaningful relationships and mutual understanding of another human being's situation, constitutes a fulfilling life. This duo, as you may guess, was one of those 480-megapixel pictures that I will never forget. This mother, with her infinite patience, cared for her autistic child and even apologized to me, but I had not even been able to look beyond myself to put myself in her shoes for a moment. Looking at this child, I couldn't help but think of my own brother who struggled with illness. Most importantly, I found the mother's resiliency and unrelenting love for her son were qualities I could carry into my life. Since that 480-megapixel picture, my connections with my family members, especially my brother, have grown. Moreso now than before, I am more accepting of them regardless of our differences and I try to be conscious in our interactions to show more empathy. Previously, where there was an underlying tension in our household, there is peace and acceptance.Those lines from Shatter Me helped me realize just how vital it is to see others for who they truly are. Whether those people are close friends or individuals I have just encountered, they have their own diverse experiences, insights, and perspectives that I can learn from. The concept of reaching out to connect, physically and literally, is not a new one. However, in a world of iPhone pictures and social media, where the world seems to be more connected than it ever has been before, the wisdom of this quote reminded me that the images around us, the ones that we see with our eyes, are the most important ones.In today's society, there is a commonly held belief that when you're living with people who do not agree with you, you do not need to maintain factual discussion, instead whatever abstraction that you and your community believe is considered right. If everyone agrees without question, discourse that leads to the synthesis of potentially conflicting ideologies does not exist. If others follow blindly, with no one challenging the established status quo, there is no growth of ideas within that realm. Compassion arises from the acts of sympathy, pity, and concern for the suffering of others, and without any challenge to dogmatic idealism, those who suffer are merely viewed as weak. Most importantly, for democratic societies to function efficiently, it is essential for open-mindedness to become a personal habit, especially when confronting those with whom we disagree. These three tenants form the noble art of disagreement. In this case of the jurors, the ideal reason for disagreement is not based on a misunderstanding, as the jurors would have had unbiased information about the topic at hand. On the contrary, I would argue that if the one juror rises against the status quo from perfect comprehension, from having chewed over the information and ideas of her peers so thoroughly that she could adequately form a rebuttal, she should be respected and justice should be upheld. From the perspective of the noble art of disagreement, to be one juror out of twelve who votes innocent, one has to first understand well before disagreeing well. For the juror to have opposed, she would have had to read deeply, listen carefully, and allow for the possibility that she might be persuaded by what her fellow jurors had to say.  She should be granted the right to her beliefs, and given the opportunity to express them in an open forum for justice, which is only as good as the foundation of the synthesis between opposing views it can build.",,,
215,Admitsee,4,,,3,4,5,,"I'm a freak about ear plugs. I am almost certain that you have been using earplugs wrong your entire life. You can't just stuff them into your ears. You have to roll them up slowly, increasing pressure until all the air has been removed. Then you use your opposite hand to lift your ear while inserting the earplug. I know this because I take earplugs seriously. I need them to focus, to block out my surroundings so I can study.When I first discovered the wonderful foamy rolls, I was finally at peace. Since I was young, I've always stayed up late. In third grade, I began devouring books until 3:00 a.m., reveling in the quiet. My mind has always functioned better after curfew, but in sixth-grade, staying up late became a necessity. My twin sisters were born. Their shrieking made me long for the solace of the night. That's where my earplugs entered the equation.Every morning, for an average of 54 minutes, I am confined to a space of approximately 7,550 cubic centimeters as my mother drives my sisters and me to school. In order to survive, my polyurethane shields remain in place, so all I can hear is blood thudding in my eardrums. This always did the trick \u2013 until the day it didn't.Without removing my earplugs, I look into the backseat and stare at my six-year-old sisters, Ana and Sofia. I can hear them through the earplugs. They're acting like brats. They know what that look means, Stop. They don't.I sigh and turn. Kids will be kids.A moment later, I feel kicks on my seat. Ana howls.That's it. I'm done. I move to grab Sofia's hand to stop her from walloping Ana. I hold her arm. I'm about to squeeze it, resorting to violence myself. I come to my senses. I let go.It's too late. Before I know it, Sofia is yelling and kicking. Having a fit. Hitting Ana. Distracting my mother. I reach out to restrain her. She kicks. Connects with my face. Blood pours from my nose.I slap her.She stares at me in shock. This has never happened before. I look into her eyes. Something clicks inside her. Her fit will never stop now.I give up. Resign myself to my earplugs. The guilt consumes me.I slapped my own sister.Just before bed, I hear my door squeak open. Light footsteps tread towards me. I feel something pounce. Sofia strangles my neck and smothers me with hugs. She doesn't hate me.I should've listened. Been open to them. Maybe I wouldn't have needed to resort to something I'll never forgive myself for.There are still moments when my sisters drive me nuts, but to me, there's nothing sweeter than my sisters' love.When they scream, I know they're having fun. When they fight, I know I can't ignore them. It's an opportunity to intervene. When they're wrong, an opportunity to help them grow. I love their loud annoying voices. They won't be my baby sisters forever, and I won't be around forever.Recently, I stumbled upon an amazing deal. I bought 100 earplugs for $2.00. However, I've only used three pairs.I'd relied on these foam crutches to keep me sane. I built a barrier from reality \u2013 from interacting with my sisters. In an odd way, Ana and Sofia taught me I can't hide from the world behind my earplugs.Sometimes I lapse. I think about my earplugs. I look to my desk drawer - that's where they reside. I wish my sisters would just shut up, especially when they're yelling in the backseat. They don't understand I need to work. I need quiet. But then I remember what comes with seclusion. I remember what happens when I forget to remember.",,,
216,Admitsee,4,1,2,3,,,,"Trudging past the sea of yellow school buses, I looked up to see kids rolling down the windows and making odd smoking gestures at me. As they moved the imaginary cigarette away from their mouths, they released a satisfied 'ahhhhh.'  'Rifahhhhh\u2026'All I wanted was to get on the bus and blast music from my headphones, but I would first have to endure my classmates' taunting. I already knew my name was different, but I had no idea why the kids were chanting it. What could smoking a cigarette possibly have to do with me?Inside the bus, I was startled by a girl waving her cell phone in my face. When she handed me the phone with 'reefa' typed into the Urban Dictionary search bar, everything suddenly clicked.  Reefa: Another name for marijuana. Like weed.  'That's not how you spell my name,' I cried, devastated by the contents of the screen.'Same difference,' she snickered.  I grew up with my mom telling me that my name meant 'highness', blissfully unaware of the fact that it was actually slang for a commonly used drug. After my realization, I developed a certain sense of self-consciousness that surfaced whenever I met new people. Did they know what my name meant? Were they going to start making smoking gestures like the kids on the bus? As I got older, introductions were not as juvenile as they were in my elementary years, but my cheeks still flushed whenever people recognized the slang definition of my name.Every knowing grin, sly comment, and incorrect pronunciation reminded me of one thing: no matter how 'American' my accent sounded or clothes looked, I was not one. Rifah is the Arabic word for highness, elevation, and dignity, but it means the complete opposite in English. Determined to dissociate from my culture, I naively decided that I was going to change my name.For the next few birthdays, I blew out the candles and requested a speedy route to turning eighteen. Under Illinois law, I could legally change my name at age eighteen. I fantasized about how easy life would be with the name Victoria and decided to transform myself into her. To me, Victoria represented poise and perfection. I carefully monitored what I wore, stopped eating with my hands at home, and made sure to never sit without crossing my legs. I thought that by changing my mannerisms, I could compensate for the fact that I had a different cultural background.The harder I tried to be Victoria, the more miserable I felt. I was chasing after an identity that I could never fully assume and restricting myself from doing the things that made me happy. I loved dressing up in traditional Bengali clothes, eating rice for every meal, and not over analyzing my every move in fear of judgment\u2014but being Victoria meant that I had to give all of that up.As the years have passed, the number of times I have been mocked for my name has increased tenfold; however, each encounter affects me less. The people who attempt to demean me for my name have been outnumbered by the people who think it is extremely cool. Serving as an icebreaker, my name no longer has the power to make me cower in fear whenever I meet new people. In fact, I might even be the first to point it out.  With time, I have acquired the ability to laugh at myself and not take life too seriously. Maybe Victoria embodies poise and perfection, but Rifah loves laughing like there is nobody watching, eating spicy food with her hands, and singing Bengali songs at the top of her lungs.As my eighteenth birthday approaches, I am looking forward to the idea of leaving Victoria behind with the rest of my childhood.",,,

The aftermath left us stationed in a small table to sort our differences; we baulked, however, at the thought of talking to each other and turned our chairs to see something much more interesting than the other\u2014a wall. After what seemed like years of silence, an ill-disposed pair of greetings lead to a unique revelation: we both came from Belize, a country whose small stature and lack of any real importance to the U.S proved difficult when finding someone who acknowledged its existence, much less a fellow Belizean. It's fair to say this simple fact, the place we called home, was the key to forging a bond that would last ages. Maybe it was because we were both from a place nobody acknowledged, and this manifested itself as something integral to our very identity. We were misunderstood and lacked any real friends; we were outcasts whose existence was a nuisance at most. But, now! Now, we had each other.It didn't take us long to become inseparable. Soon, it became predictable as to who I was eating lunch with or passing by the weekends with. Anything and everything, from every joke to every rooftop sleepover, it was always Shawna. As the years passed, we began meeting in a desolate house at the end of the road, climbing the ridiculously high roof (or maybe we were just short), to gaze at the radiant stars overhead as the moon took center stage. There was nothing we loved more than watching the opulence of stars, and it was during these moments that we picked a star, a lone star\u2014a firefly in the sky\u2014that refused to dissipate as the morning's celestial giant took its position, however, this wasn't the only thing she picked. At sometime, unbeknownst to me, she began to use Tar (impure heroin), something I vehemently opposed, but I was unable to remove the parasitic addiction growing inside her. After innumerable fights I gave up\u2014I was useless. Then, the day before Thanksgiving 2014, she overdosed. She passed away shortly after.I tried to deny her death. I couldn't bring myself to admit she was gone, but soon I found myself thinking 'It's my fault, it's my fault, it's my fault, it's my...' and I remained in this cycle for months to come, until I brought myself to look up again.Her death resulted in the greatest upheaval I've ever faced, replanting habits I had spent years cultivating. I grew a certain delight in waking up before the hum of the city to stare at our star. I grew a determination to work hard, to spearhead my way through life, to get what I wanted because life was an ever changing sea of possibility. I grew dedicated to living for two people at once. To this day, I still visit the same lonely house to watch the resilient star we grew fond of. I wonder what'd she say if she saw me, how she would look; I wonder if she's the firefly in the sky.",,,
218,Admitsee,3.5,1,,,,5,,"The room was nearlysilent;theonly sound coming from the periodic ticking of a clock in the corner.I stood firmly in front of a panel of seven emotionless individuals and three of my own scoutmasters, who, after intense deliberation, arrived at a unanimous decision that would change my life forever.Instantaneously, my identity changed from an average, teenage, high school student to an honorableEscoteirodaP\u00e0tria, the Brazilian equivalent of the AmericanEagleScoutrank. Throughout my life, I have been involved with a multitude of extracurricular activities, including competitive sports, school band, and community service groups, but the activity that has transformed me the most and that I'm the most passionate about is my involvement withScouting, in both Brazil and the United States. I beganScoutingin the first grade, and eleven years later, I was awarded the highest rank within the Brazilian scouting movement, marking the zenith of myScoutingcareer and the most prestigious achievement in my lifesofar.When the members of the board congratulated me, and told me they decided that I had accomplished all the requirements of the rank and passed their review, I felt a strange feeling. I wasn't relieved, surprised, or excited. It was then that I realized that the rank and title ofEscoteirodaP\u00e0triameant far less to me than the path that I took to getthere.That night I went home and, lying in bed, I remembered learning how to smooth a block of wood with sandpaper during my first attempt to make a soapbox car for the Pinewood Derby. I remembered my reaction when my parents said we were moving to Brazil and not being able to speak Portuguese at my first scout meeting there. I remembered undercooking hamburgers and burning marshmallows on multiple camping trips. I remembered carrying members of my patrol who fainted during a grueling cave adventure. These are the moments that matter to me; these helped me gain knowledge, patience, and maturity. I remembered the challenge of leading younger scouts during my final project. I relived the restless nights before the start of the project, second-guessing my measurements, concerned that I might blow the budget. I recalled teaching younger scouts how to correctly use a saw so that they wouldn't hurt themselves or others. I remembered presenting the finished project to the scout group's leaders, and howthey were relieved to know that they finally had a sustainable and long-lasting waste management system that would serve the community for years to come.It was this project, and times like it, that demanded every ounce of my patience, experience, and leadership capabilities, that transformed me into the best man I can be. I now realize thatmy identity had been developed long before I stood in that quiet room. Yet, that is the only tangible date able to mark the transformation I've experienced. It is the date that changed my identity in the eyes of others forever. However, far more important than that one date, are the experiences leading up to it. The years, the tears, the sweat, the pain, and the terrain I've crossed through Scouting are what have transformed me into the young adult I am today. Although each individual experience on its own only offers a single lesson that I have learned, the culmination of those experiences and lessonsarewhat define who I am today.",,,
219,Admitsee,3.5,,,3,,5,,"Quiet, submissive, unopinionated\u2014these are sundry deep-rooted stereotypes for Asian women in American society. Nothing about me has ever fit this description. In my childhood, I thrived on hamburgers, screaming contests, and stubborn quarrels defending my opinion. I never considered race, gender, or any outward differences between those with whom I interacted. Yet, as I grew up, I noticed and soon loathed my peers' labels for Asian girls like me: weird, geeky, shy. Refusing to be shepherded into such boxes due to my appearance, I disassociated myself from my eventually ostracized culture. I was determined to be one of the white kids\u2014the 'normal' kids.However, my worldview changed the summer of 2014. The shooting of Michael Brown and the following Ferguson riots gave me an unfiltered view into race dynamics in America. The library, in which I had once innocently flipped through self-help books, now became a safe haven to contemplate social justice. I devoured poems by Audre Lorde on race politics and works by Loretta Lees on gentrification in major cities. In my community, I searched for and tuned into conversations on microaggressions, disproportionate judicial penalties, and white feminism. In one of her poetry anthologies, Lorde wrote, 'It is not our differences that divide us. It is our inability to recognize, accept, and celebrate those differences.' I understood, then, that my evasion of Chinese culture stemmed from my peers' as well as my own inability to appreciate the unique aspects of my heritage. I also recognized that if I hadn't been enlightened to discussions on identity, I would have continued to reject my culture.So, I created a club at my high school, Social Justice on Campus, to give greater visibility to these conversations. I lead weekly meetings to discuss various issues with topics ranging from the Mizzou\/Yale protests to the connotations of 'political correctness.' Aside from just deliberating during meetings, club members often take action after witnessing palpable issues within the community that called for it. After the horrific Orlando shooting, students at Lexington High chose to focus solely on the event's ties to terrorism and its role in the growth of ISIL. With approval from the administration, other club members and I anonymously drew a mural in the center of the school reading, 'LGBTQ+ Community, we love you and we want you here at LHS.' The dialogue shifted.The summer following my junior year, I interned at The Welcome Project, a nonprofit aimed at empowering immigrants. With the organization, I coordinated a summer program for kids focused on exploring their diverse identities. Surprisingly, I learned just as much from the children as they learned from me. I had once naively believed that I would not relate well to the Latino community due to my contrasting cultural upbringing. However, after spending time with the children and their families, I realized that I didn't have to be from the same culture in order to join Latinos in celebrating the joy of life; Lorde's words rang true that summer.As I continue to engage with and learn from various social movements taking place in the country, I become increasingly impassioned to be a part in bringing about lasting, positive change. Having been previously consumed by internalized racism particularly motivates me to work towards public policy that supports broader early education on race, gender, sexuality, and other forms of identity. Among the many new things I've encountered in the past few years, I've learned especially that the most crucial elements to emotional survival are conversation, encouragement, empathy, and trust. To break the social barriers in our society, to fight for people whether they look, speak, or act differently is the road this nation needs to achieve tolerance. We've come so far in furnishing justice within American society, and I cannot wait to undertake my own future work in accompanying this mounting motion to promote equality for all.",,,
220,Admitsee,4,1,2,,,,,"As I stepped out onto the dirt track in borrowed, black cowgirl boots, I felt like a fraud. An unfamiliarly heavy pendant bounced on my chest as I shuffled in front of two decorated horses whose equallyadorned riders proudly gripped flags atop their steeds. I clutched the microphone in my clammy hand, clinging to my one comfort in the enormous, foreign stadium. I glanced up at the Jumbotron and I could see the back of a girl with pageant-worthy hair walking towards the center of the track. At first I thought it was a mere coincidence that we shared this same feature, but it soon dawned on me that the girl was me. I took my place in front of four military officers whose postures were stiff as pokers. As I centered myself in the track. I looked out to the crowd where thousands of Stetson hats gleamed in a sea of heads. One of the announcer's voices -either Will or Wayne- echoed over the loud speaker: 'Ladies and gentleman, with the Star-Spangled Banner, here is, Audrey Mustoe!'Studies show that a person's number one fear is public speaking. Death is number two. So if more people would rather die than speak in front of a large crowd, why do I crave the spotlight? Why did I willingly step out in front of 14,000 people to put myself in a position where audience members could judge and criticize me?I'm a bit of an anomaly, since no one else in my family sings. Sometimes people ask me, 'So where did you get your singing ability?' Truth is, my 'ability' is self-taught, from watching Disney movies and YouTube videos. Following my cue, I took a deep breath, and opened my mouth. The words of our country's National Anthem tumbled from my lips; the lyrics were second nature to me after endlessly practicing the song in the shower, in the car, and in my head. I searched the crowd for the faces of my friends and family, who looked at me with anxious yet encouraging expressions.Before I had walked out onto the track, I reminded myself why I auditioned to sing in the first place. I hadn't tried out two years in a row for a gig only to be miserable while I performed. It was an opportunity of a lifetime, so I better enjoy it.Once I conquered the first few verses of the anthem, my nerves disappeared. A smile spread across my face. I relished my moment in the spotlight, and floated the high note of the song. The crowd started to cheer as I began the last verse.Despite my nervousness before the performance, I realized in that moment my passion to perform trumped all other feelings. I am usually modest about my achievements or talents, but singing is an exception. The time I stand in the limelight is a time when I can let my guard down. Although vulnerability might be scary at first, I'm not afraid to show who I am. The adrenaline I feel in front of a crowd fuels my obsession, making me crave it all the more.That's why I grinned broader than ever when I belted out the words, 'O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!'Extracurricular Essay150 word max.When I touched a field hockey stick for the first time, I had no idea the sport wouldbecome a four-year passion of mine, or that I would be captain for two years. I didn'tknow I would use that stick to whack the ball past the goalie, scoring the first goal ofthe season last year. In that fateful game, I dribbled the ball down the field, passed itto my teammate, who then crossed it back to me, before I tapped it into the goal.However, in the fast-paced game setting, my teammates thought she had scored thegoal, not me. At first I felt cheated out of my glory, but later I realized the goal wasn'tfor myself, it was for the team. That day I learned not only how to be a field hockeyplayer, but also how to be a team player.",,,

When the pain became more than I could bare, after I ate a dinner for four to appease my worried parents, I went to the emergency room. There, an observant nurse and an incredulous doctor discovered an anomaly.It was freshman year of high school, and my body was going to kill me.After noticing an irregularity in my blood pressure, the nurse informed the physician, who in turn discovered a heart murmur. Astonished that my family had no prior knowledge of this, he referred us to a cardiologist who then confirmed to my scared and worried family the terrifying diagnosis. 'A bicuspid aortic valve led to severe regurgitation of blood blow. If it's left uncheck, this will lead to cardiomegaly and after that, heart failure.'Essentially, a hole in my heart would kill me unless I underwent open-heart surgery.It was freshman year of high school, and my life was slipping away.I wasn't going to die. Fortunately, the aberration within me had been discovered in time \u2013 barely. The only life- threatening danger was the inherent risk in all open-heart surgeries. However, although my physical body had surpassed the crisis, many other aspects of my life had been affected. Everything used to come to me with ease: I was a high school freshman excelling in senior courses, at the top of my class, and was able to play varsity basketball after my freshman year at a Division 1 school. I was, being driven by an egotistical personality, able to eat, play, and do as I please. My diagnosis changed all that. I missed several weeks of classes visiting countless cardiologists and surgeons. I struggled to keep up with school work. My coach made the hurtful but logical decision to take me off the roster, convinced that I wouldn't be able to play at such a competitive level in the upcoming season. For the first time in my life, I experienced tremendous failure.It was freshman year of high school, and I had given up.Absolutely defeated by such a novel experience, the days preceding the surgery were riddled with silent self-pity.The surgery, upon completion, became the object of my hatred and blame. The operation that had saved my life had taken all that I held dear as a price, and left me incapacitated for months. However, I was wrong. At the highest point of despair, a change in my character was going to take place.Finding religion in the time of uncertainty, I often prayed to my patron saint, Kyrillos. During one night in the hospital, in the midst of the dim lights and muffled beeps, the distinct noise of a woman crying in the adjacent room awoke me. Drowsily, without much thought, I prayed that my saint would leave my bedside to comfort her.Immediately, I felt a sensation of my heart stopping. The experience of distraught hopelessness, as my heart began to give away, sparked something inside me. I found myself able to disregard my immediate needs for the sake of others. Additionally, the fear that I felt as I seemed to approach death awakened my broken soul. I became so immensely ashamed that I had given up; the notion that I deserve better disappeared. I was given the beautiful gift of life, a second chance to live fully and love fully. The entitled, selfish, and self-centered persona within me burned away to be replaced by a young man defined by this experience. Defined in such a way \u2013 after intimately knowing the meaning of pain and hopelessness through failure \u2013 so that perseverance and compassion became the pinnacles of my character.Freshman year of high school was now over, and my second chance at life had begun.",,,
222,Admitsee,4,1,,,,,6,"A SWORD'S GATEWAY THROUGH ME:I never knew I'd find a second home. I guess it waltzed itself into my life the moment I timidly walked into the advanced journalism 'sub,' sitting down next to the only other teenager who had been accepted onto staff that year, a short, ungainly-looking girl with a brilliant grin and a boy who looked almost as innocent as I.Falconerds love to joke that our sub is a magic portal. Usually it leads to the fantasy world of Narnia\u2014or whatever my mind happens to dwell on when questioned by inquisitive outsiders. Yet as I've ventured deeper into its depths for the past three years, With its one wall of reflecting windows facing the exterior, the sub is a near-perfect mirror on the outside world. Sitting within this curtain of invisibility, I can see the figures of other students and teachers gliding across the silver screen as though in a silent film sequence. It is in this familiar yet enchanted place that I have conducted many of my most enlightening interviews over the years. True, there is glamour in the notion that journalists serve as the 'gatekeepers to the news,' and the opportunities I have been endowed with on a daily basis, from phone conversations with officials in the governor's office to conferences with teen movie stars, are tantalizingly unlike any of the experiences offered to the typical high school student. Whether it is with a hot air ballooning agency struggling with increasingly strict restrictions each year or a homeless man searching for a purpose in life, interviews have led me to witness firsthand the beauty and pain of each individual's story. It is incredibly humbling, and incredibly ironic that the resounding majority of the people I have spoken with I will never meet again, yet even as a stranger I was given the chance time and time again to share in their lives, to believe, to empathize. At first, I drank in this newfound perception and sought to shine the spotlight on the individual through my writing, struggling to freeze these transcendental moments I witnessed into the monochromatic ink of newsprint.But it was not until, in the comfort of the sub's couches before a quaint tea-table and accompanied by a seemingly undepletable jar of Twizzler licorice candies, I was swept from the once pain-free bubble in which I dwelled into a whirlpool of emotions, that I began to realize that the quintessence of the human existence could never be captured in mere syllables. Reaching out to the parents of a student who was killed by a tragic prescription drug overdose, it was in the sub that I first learned to be sincere, to trust, to live, as the old couple's optimism shamed the petty squabbles that had governed so much of my life until then, optimism that, though marred by regret, anger, and despair, engulfed an irrepressible hope. Never before having personally experienced sorrow so close to home, I was struck deeply by the family's story\u2014not only by their son's passing, but even more by the unselfish willingness of his parents to share with me their most profound pain and most insightful reflections. Now I reach out to every soul in the sky, cry until my tears can fill an ocean, laugh until I doubt I'll ever breathe again.Even when I walk out the mirrored doors of the sub for the last time next year in June, I know I will look back upon the portal, and, if it is 2:30 a.m. on a starlit Wednesday morning, the green glow of the LED sign at the door will blink fondly once more in the distance: SUB OPEN.",,,

226,Admitsee,2,1,,,,,6,"Reading was something I disliked doing as a kid. I was the type of kid who loved to play games and toys as an activity rather than reading. My reading ability remained stagnant at that point in my childhood. Throughout my early education, my reading scores were usually lower than the average student. Then middle school came and that was when the next few years became life-changing and unforgettable. At my school, the library had this program called Reading Counts! where students are engaged to read many varieties of books and earn points by taking quizzes corresponding to the bookTime management is such a huge skill that I think is very important in my life but it was something that I didn't know how to hone. My spring semester of my junior year was where I had a very busy schedule. I had AP classes and AP exams were coming up so I had to study for them. I had a college class on Mondays and Wednesdays and SAT prep on Tuesdays and Thursdays that made me stay longer until the evening, especially when I had Confirmation every Thursday right after. In some days, I had to take care of my older sister because my dad had errands to run to, usually buying groceries or picking up my mom from work in the late evening. My older sister has Down syndrome, meaning that I had to follow certain things that I can do to take care of my sister because of her condition. Taking care of my sister sometimes sacrificed the time spent on doing my academics and extracurriculars. All of this made me realize that I need to fix my time management skills. At first, I didn't know how I could keep myself academically and mentally on course without jeopardizing the next few years that could be a pivot point in my life. I stick to this one advice from a few people that had went through a similar situation causing them to struggle very much. That advice was to start with one thing at a time. It was simple advice that personally changed my everyday habits. Because of it, this challenge definitely helped me in the long run. The more I was adapted to doing things one by one, the more productive and organized I've become. Doing it on a daily basis made helped me set my priorities straight, finish things earlier than I expected to be, and I get more time to spend for myself, such as reading or finishing up my homework.In all of my years, I never realized that until now, Environmental Science has been my favorite subject. It all started when I watched this show called 'Fetch with Ruff Ruffman'. I remember every day I would get home from school and quickly go to my room, turn on the T.V., hoping that I didn't miss anything from that day's episode. The show talked about many scientific topics that I find very interesting, like physics, chemistry, and etc. As an elementary school student, this was something that I never knew about in school, until I get to watch the show. The show made me realize that science is fun, cool, and interesting to learn about. Although I enjoyed this show as a child, I never imagined actually enjoying science classes, that is, until I took AP Environmental Science this year. On the first day of school, our teacher talked about what's the biggest environmental issue we are facing today. Our assignment was to make a poster relating to the issue we picked and list what are some of the effects that is harmful to the world. Most of the class, even me, chose air pollution as the biggest issue we faced today. Although most of the people chose that topic, they didn't know much about air pollution. I knew that our assignment can't do it on its own, so I took the initiative to lead my group using my prior knowledge about air pollution. After we finished our assignment, our teacher decided to have a class discussion on the topic we have chosen. From what I learn from that activity was not only the fact that overpopulation might be the biggest problem we face. It was rather realizing how my passion brought out the best in me. From the discussion that I've participated in, seeing myself being serious on a topic that's relevant today influenced how doing something I love should be what I do as a major\/career. I felt that from that experience, it benefits what I want to pursue in the future.There were many things that I participated and supported that benefited my school. One of which was the Green Team. When I first started in the school, I felt somewhat lost because high school was a culture shock for me and my friends. Our school was more diverse, more rigorous in academics, and it had more variety in clubs. Me and my friends decided to join our campus' environmental club, the Green Team. During that year, I enjoyed my time being at the club. Not only was it an escape from school and a bonding moment with my friends and other students that were above my grade, but I was proud to contribute to something that I think is so important to my community that might affect the future.For the next few years, there was inactivity throughout the school year where our Green Team lost both its essence and popularity. When there were elections for senior year, I knew I had the opportunity to turn this club back around to the way it used to be. Now as President, I sought for a resurgence in the Green Team for the sake of not only making our club more hardworking and strenuous, but also bringing a long-lasting effect all over the world but for our campus. What I do to ensure that our club is being active is organizing and leading school and beach clean- ups, volunteering more community service focusing on the environment, fundraising for reusable water bottles created by the club, and making sure we are able to promote environmental awareness to the school through presentations. The reason I wanted to bring the club back is not because I wanted to recreate the moments that made the Green Team special that other members can look back to. I also want to display my deep passion in environmentalism that can reflect towards the members of the club, even to the students in my campus, hopefully changing their ways and ideas that can fulfill my aim of the club: making the environment a better place.Reading was something I disliked as a kid. I was the type of kid who loved to play games and toys as an activity rather than read. My reading ability remained stagnant at that point in my childhood. Throughout my early education, my reading scores were usually lower than the average student. During the 5th grade, our class had to take a reading comprehension test every time we've finished reading a story. My reading comprehension tests were so bad that my 5th-grade teacher even offered some help. However, during the process, I felt somewhat discouraged and hopeless with improving my reading ability. Although the help resulted in slightly improving my tests and quizzes, it never happens to feel like I've achieved this personal academic obstacle.Then middle school came and that was when the next few years became life-changing and unforgettable.

227,Admitsee,3.5,1,2,,,5,6,"Muy, narod Soyedinyonikh Shtatov Ameriki...'Spoken in Russian, especially to American students, the US Constitution sounds little like the original refrain. But to E, my classmate from Moscow, those words meant everything. The day she recited the Preamble in her native language in front of our eighth-grade history class, I found myself captivated by her speech. The foreign rhythm mesmerized me: As I attempted to decipher the whirlwind of E's rolled r's and cryptic expressions, I craved for understanding.For the next several months, I filled my mind with miscellaneous Russian phrases, but without practice, my efforts fell flat. My 'passion' could only truly take flight two years later when a thick envelope arrived in my mailbox, announcing my acceptance to the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy. Upon arriving to campus in the fall, the first class I enrolled in was Russian.Russian class quickly became my escape from the familiar. While math and science provided me with comfort, the infinite permutations and mysteries of language opened my mind to entirely new ways of thinking. I could just barely wrap my head around the diminutive forms of my Russian name, Sergei: At any given time I could be Seryozh, Seryozha, or Seryozhenka. I imagined myself as a fearless warrior, but instead of fighting barrages of flaming arrows, I defeated endless conjugations and decoded confusing letters into fascinating words and sounds. I could do anything -- by the end of my sophomore year, I thought myself invincible.That impression changed the following year, shortly after I landed in Saint Petersburg, Russia with eight other exchange students. I expected myself to be fluent, easily navigating Cyrillic signs and speaking unaccented Russian; instead, I was overwhelmed, puzzled by the cacophony of language around me and woefully unprepared to bring my Russian into the real world. The mistakes began as soon as I reached the apartment, where I addressed my host parents with an informal privyet rather than the more respectful zdravstvuyte. More embarrassment greeted me after I had unpacked my luggage and my host mother N.P. asked me whether I wanted to eat or sleep. I responded with a single da (meaning 'yes'), leaving us both completely perplexed.Despite the linguistic chaos, I pushed on, motivated by the obsession that had led me to take Russian to begin with. In the process, I let each of the Ps introduce me to new linguistic worlds. N's specialty was geography, and our discussions were always full of faraway lands. Chikago, she taught me, was simply 'Chicago' pronounced in a Russian accent, while the adjective for German\u2014 Nemetskii\u2014 seemed anything but intuitive. A, my host brother, introduced me to teenage slang. Ya umirayu s golodu, as I learned, translated to 'I'm dying of starvation': The phrase would save me on several late-night, foodless excursions. Although I occasionally tripped over my new vocabulary, I had finally found room to grow.Living, eating, and joking with people like the Ps -- that's how I can truly call myself a good Russian student. They helped me realize that my curiosity is best paired with a pinch of modesty; anyone can become my teacher, if I let them. Now back in America, I still do not know all the answers-- but rather than let that fact discourage me, I return to the classroom, ready to master more grammar, write more Cyrillic, and add more words to my inventory. Along the way I will make mistakes, but I will not let failure dissuade me: After all, the gaps in my knowledge are what encourage me to trudge on, unraveling the world one word at a time.",,,
228,Admitsee,2.5,1,,,,5,,"Please don't tell me you've bitten one of your classmates again', her eyes pleaded. When the school principal called my mother, asking to have a private conversation with her, she instantly deemed me guilty of a toothy crime. Although I must admit there was background for this accusation, I wasn't guilty this time \u2014 not of this crime, at least. My actual wrongdoing had been to bite the forbidden fruit, getting a taste of the knowledge reserved to the big kids. I had learned to read and to write on my own, at the age of three.Analyzing the occasion from an impartial point of view, it was merely a supply and demand dilemma: I wanted to hear more stories, but nobody could find more time to read them for me. I did not want to be just a passive listener, dependent on others' goodwill, so I took the matter into my own hands and did the only thing I could do: read.Needless to say, this event shaped my life. I skipped two grades in school and won a scholarship to one of the best schools in Cear\u00e0. As a kid that came from a low-income family, this opportunity meant the world for me. In the beginning, I didn't adapt very well. As a kid accustomed to learning on her own, my mind did not stick to the endless lessons the teacher taught. Why did it matter if three was an odd number if I could still divide three cakes between my mother and me? As time passed, however, new classes were added to the curriculum, and school finally managed to get my attention. Finally, the science laboratory classes started.A new world was introduced to me, in which I could see that theory and practice fit perfectly. On my quest to understand these phenomena, I spent hours looking through encyclopedias, bothering adults with my questions and browsing the internet seeking answers. I found meaning in the seemingly useless numbers the teachers taught; if they were the language of science, then I would willingly study them. To help those struggling with those classes, I became a volunteer tutor at my school, an experience that taught me that although some of my classmates weren't interested in science, it only took a bit of polyol and isocyanate to change their minds.It was only in 9th grade, however, that my interest became serious. What before I before knew as science then branched to physics, chemistry, and biology, and scientific olympiads made a debut in my life. My participation in olympiads placed me in the national selection exams for the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO). I had dreamt of the possibility of representing my country in a high-level competition like IChO since I was young, and when one of the best preparatory schools in Brazil offered me a scholarship to help me in this pursuit, I immediately accepted the offer. At Col\u00e9gio Ari de S\u00e0 Cavalcante, I met some of my country's brightest students, and their hard work inspired me to dive deeper into my education, giving all that I had until the very end. Although I didn't make it into the national team, the knowledge and maturity I gained on my journey made it more than worth it.I am proud to say education changed my life. I am grateful for all the opportunities I received, and that is why I work hard to improve the quality of life in my community, be it volunteering at schools or simply visiting children hospitals to read for them. I believe that education is the only way out of the systemic poverty present in Brazil today. I will commit myself to the effort of making education a universal right, instead of a privilege for the very few who can afford it, so that others' lives can be changed just as much as mine was.",,,

'It's just easier.'I named one Gammon, anyway. They arrived at the store two weeks after I ordered them, shipped in a cardboard box with holes punched in it. After spending countless nights flipping endlessly through Brooks' catalog, I was confident these pheasants were going to be perfect. There were four, the minimum order Brooks' allowed.'Wait, why pheasants?' I remember my dad had asked when he first found out about my little venture.I replied, 'They're for fly fishing!'  I had become obsessed. It was not enough to visit LLBean's Hunting and Fishing store. I had to construct these flies from start to finish, know what was on the end of my line. I had to be responsible for my own feathers, not dependent on just any that came from some far off place. At the time, my eight-year-old self did not realize that this went beyond normal, beyond long sweeping casts into a stream. I was living in the dream of fishing during the day, Orvis books at night. But why was I so fixated on fly fishing? There was no family tradition, no fishing club. I arrived at this intense fascination on my own. Eventually, and perhaps inevitably, interest in fishing started to fade, replaced increasingly with a different but similarly fierce pursuit: music. It was my fly rod for a banjo, fly vise for staff paper, babbling brooks for open concert halls. True to my character, what started as traditional bluegrass evolved rapidly into an affinity for jazz and classical styles. I became not merely involved in one world of music but instead immersed in many: an expression of my ever-curious passion. While strange to some, my intensely inquisitive personality had driven me silently forward. And slowly, I began to view my personality as a benefit, both as a tool to drive my exploration of diverse interests and a trait to help achieve my greatest aspirations.As a child, I was constantly surrounded by a tactile learning steeped in genuine interest. My father was a creative force of nature. Through handmade beehives and Adirondack chairs, barn raisings and boat restorations, my personality began to evolve. The environment created by my father's ethos encouraged creativity and deep exploration. In a world satisfied by 'Made in China', I was nestled in the comfort of self-reliance and the contentment that came with wood shavings and feather clippings on the ground. Influenced by these surroundings, I have become a person constantly questioning the world around me. And no matter what my next passion might be, I know that I will bring to it an inquisitive nature, delving well past its normal bounds.As things on a farm often go, my four pheasant chicks dwindled down to two, and then finally to one. But one grown pheasant was enough. It was all I needed to furnish my fly fishing endeavors for the year to come and complete my quest for a full understanding of my passion. What might have started as the simple tie of a fly had grown to much more. It far exceeded raising a bird for its feathers or the grim notion our farm had one less pheasant. I still have those flies I tied in the months that followed, stored neatly in my fly box. Almost nine years later, they're next to the wooden case holding my banjo picks. While rods and flies have long had their places taken by the tunes of banjos and fiddles, one concept remains: no matter the experience, I forge an intense resolve and pursuit for learning that will always be an integral part of my identity, making me thankful for my 'strange' personality that began in the pages of a farm supply catalog.",,,

Up until high school, I went to an international school that followed the IB system. As part of this program, the words 'Inquirer', 'Principled' and 'Open-minded', among others, were proudly displayed in French, English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese and Dutch in every classroom throughout my elementary and middle school education. These words subconsciously became my guiding purpose. For most of my life, I was a student in an environment with people from over one-hundred countries, with a multitude of life experiences different from my own. Because of my strong moral education, and the international identities of my classmates, I began to see difference as something to celebrate rather than be ashamed of, and failed to understand why people felt the need to discriminate against others. I see myself as a citizen of a world first, and an American citizen second. I value the relationships I have with people from other countries, refuse to let country lines become an obstacle in my search for understanding and knowledge. The three people I consider my best friends from my time in elementary school are from Holland, Madagascar, and Canada. As well as growing up in a culturally-diverse environment, I began learning French at the age of two. My babysitter spoke Tagalog fluently and I would pick up slang from her. When my parents would discuss something they didn't want my sister and me to understand, they would do so in Hungarian, which they both speak fluently. I took classes in Mandarin in third grade, and learned the Arabic alphabet in fifth grade. In sixth grade, I taught myself how to write in Japanese. I joined the American Sign Language club at my middle school, and have been pursuing sign ever since. I started Spanish classes in high school. Languages have been a formative part of my youth, and are especially important to me as an actor because they have instilled a deep fascination for words and an appreciation for grammar, things I find most people take for granted. From an early age, I have learned to approach everything from a place of respect and curiosity. This is especially true in theater. If an actor writes off a character as 'different', or allows their character to fit fully under a label, they will find it almost impossible to add dimension and relate to their character. The same values and skills that made me the open-minded person I am today are necessary for my acting. They have caused me to approach my work with a sense of integrity and a need for understanding.

234,Admitsee,3,,,,,5,,"There's a picture I think of often: one thousand bees within a thin plastic ball. Some are motionless, comfortable in the vacuous center of the bubble. Others are pushing and prodding at the surface, directing the course of the ball. Our society is that plastic ball, and it needs the movement of its bees. To keep our bubble from dropping and to push it towards any inkling of progress, we must continuously fly at our limits. True advocates aren't those who settle but those who care deeply, reflect continuously, and never stop pushing. As I've come to understand this, I have tried to empower my cheeky younger brothers, Brandon and Brian, to be bees in their own lives. Every day after school, I take my brothers to the library and sit beside them while they struggle with the nuanced moral dilemmas in their reading. I wonder how they, at eleven and eight years old, make sense of books like The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing, the story of an African American slave who is manipulated into an experiment to prove white supremacy. On their birthdays, I challenge my brothers with gifts of novels beyond their reading levels. Together, we experience the pensive sadness of Ender's Game, a tale of interspecies war, that compels Brandon to borrow all of its sequels from the library and Brian to read through dinner multiple nights in a row. Reading Ender's story, I hope that they can develop empathy for all beings\u2014including those fundamentally different from us. Most recently, we forayed into the musical phenomenon Hamilton, the passionate songs of which reinforce to us society's need for determination in the face of disapproval.Now Alexander Hamilton himself was a 'bee.' The author of 51 of the 85 Federalist papers that successfully and poignantly argued for the ratification of the U.S Constitution, Hamilton never stopped pushing. In exploring his story with my brothers, I could plainly see how Hamilton moved American society forward and how concerned citizens today must embody the same level of dogged advocacy that he possessed.At school, I like to think that I have already begun to. When I learned that my school's constitution was outdated and teeming with loopholes, making our student government less transparent and unaccountable, I rewrote it entirely. With the help of friends, I continued to bridge the gap between students and student leaders by building a forum that gives students direct access to candidates' platforms and a means to voice the matters on their minds.However, in trying to be an advocate, I have also failed. While leading a mental health campaign at school, I mistakenly ostracized the very students I was trying to help by underestimating the complexity of mental illness. My team and I simplistically, though inadvertently, implied that the stigma of mental illness could be meaningfully addressed by celebratory activities and stress balls. We conflated daily struggles with disease, common stress with serious illness. This was not the advocate I had wanted to be, and it took weeks of conscious listening and earnest communication to right my failure of insight.I often wonder, does the direction in which we bees push actually matter? Or does the very act of trying, through the process of elimination, allow us to find the 'right' direction? What I do know is that I cannot forget what it means to deeply care, for seemingly innocuous comments like 'good enough,' if left unchallenged, will undermine societal progress. Advocates, like bees, need to live at the edges where though we may be least protected by our walls, we can also escape their restrictions\u2014I've learned that it is at the edges far beyond 'good enough' where the essence of progress lies.",,,
235,Admitsee,3.5,1,,,,,6,"Oh no, Michelle! Can you even eat those?' Celia's mother exclaimed, seeing the two cheeseburgers on my plate. The beef patties and slices of cheddar cheese stacked between two tiny buns were definitely not kosher. Yet, they definitely looked delicious. I was at an impasse. My family ate only kosher foods in our household and my friend's mother knew of my dietary restrictions. After years of following the scientific method in school, I deduced there was no solid evidence barring me from eating the adorably small cheeseburgers. I shrugged and bit into the slider.My parents, Soviet refugees who came to America to escape anti-Semitism, pride themselves in being able to observe their faith openly. When my grandfather passed away, my father became more religiously observant to cope with his grief. My family followed his example and began the transition away from our previous, less rigorous traditions. We decidedly identified ourselves as Orthodox Jews.Dressed in modest, black clothing, I came to my first Orthodox service to support my father. I sat on the opposite side of the room from him and the rabbis leading the service. A lace fabric, called a mechitza, separated the men and women. 'This seems sexist,' I thought. At eleven years old, alienated from the equality of my past synagogue, my modern mentality became apparent. Yet, my father looked happy, smiling at me from across the gender divide. Our difference in attitude prompted my uncertainty. I wondered if I was wrong for questioning a simple seating arrangement.In contrast, I found certainty within my academics. I felt more comfortable with my schoolwork than abstract traditions. When conducting an experiment, I knew exactly why I was following certain steps; religion didn't provide this same confidence. In AP Statistics, I learned how to prove a hypothesis significantly true with a direct methodology. No mysteries remained a mystery; unlike the religious divine, math questions could be systematically verified. In AP Chemistry, where I measured acids and bases in (almost) perfect proportions to create a neutralized solution, the logic behind the science was clear. This precise reasoning contrasted to my struggle with religion where I had no way to determine which level of observance was correct.My inability to find rationality within Judaism caused me to stop practicing religion. During this time, my father and I argued daily. I saw him as a traditionalist, stuck in his ways, while I was as a modern woman pursuing academic interests. However, I felt disconnected from my father. Perhaps, I was being too harsh and judgmental due to my discomfort with his beliefs.As the years wore on, I noticed my father reading Hebrew prayer books late into the night. His studies led him to keep a detailed list of questions at the ready for whenever he invited rabbis to our home. In many ways, the diligence he took in discovering his beliefs were parallel to my own academic inquiry. Both of us craved knowledge and understanding. For him, religion was a salve to deal with his grief over the loss of a parent. For me, schoolwork offered the solace of clear answers in lieu of rituals and prayers.Debating with my father on the tenants of his ideology hasn't been easy. Nevertheless, we find commonality in a main principle of Judaism: the encouragement of questioning. Unlike many other religions, Judaism doesn't comport itself to blind faith. Instead, one is instructed to catechize in order to strengthen one's beliefs. By finding a common trait of intellectual curiosity with my father, we've reached a de\u0301tente.These days, my questions still aren't fully answered. I'm working to find my set of beliefs by applying reasoning to whatever crosses my path (including cheeseburgers). As I learn and deliberate, I won't judge others for doing the same.",,,

237,Admitsee,3,,,,,,6,"Every day, I'm captivated by some new question or query \u2013 anything from theories of aging to the fourth dimension. I'm fortunate enough to be able to turn to scientific research, where I can shed light on some of my most burning questions (and hopefully improving lives one day too). However, I wasn't always this way. I found my endless curiosity in a rather unorthodox manner.When I was young, I was one of those children who never could sit still. For me though, running around wasn't the antidote to my antics. Instead, the only thing which could make me sit still was an answer to the question, 'Why?' Invariably though, whatever answer I had managed to procure would only tame my curiosity for a few minutes, and before long, the whole cycle would start over again.One day, frustrated, my mother handed me 'The Big Book of Questions and Answers', and I plopped myself down in a massive leather chair and was hooked immediately. I immersed myself in everything that book had to offer, from astronomy to zoology. Before long, I had reached the back cover. However, I remained deeply unsatisfied.There remained so many more questions to be answered! I took to the internet.It was then that I first stumbled upon Wikipedia. I vividly recall diving into the its depths, an explorer who had stumbled upon something new, something huge! I became a sleuth, hot on the trail of the next answer. In an almost trance-like state, I could sit for hours on end, trying to absorb as much information as I possibly could hold, clicking link after link. I turned into Indiana Jones, returning time and time again, each time driven by an insatiable curiosity. Upon each return to the seemingly endless depths of Wikipedia, I was drawn in by yet another question.Perhaps the day's events would lead me to inquire about lasers or Dracula or anything in between.One day though, while deep into an investigation on dreaming (how exactly do they happen?And why?), I ran into a problem \u2013 a big one. The webpage stared back at me blankly, asking me to help start a new page. The unthinkable had happened. I had simply run out of hyperlinks. The next answer didn't live in the next click. The next answer didn't even exist at all. Even then, I knew I had reached something substantial: the edge of Wikipedia, the limits of human knowledge. Now, I knew, the game had changed. It wasn't that I lost the drive to keep wondering, but rather that there wasn't anything more to find. Beyond this point, there was simply\u2026 nothing. This concept of non-existence, this state of not knowing, if anything, fascinated me more than anything else. Yet, at the same time, it frustrated me to no end. How there could be no further clues to follow, no more answers to find on this trail?As I grew older, I discovered my own way of finding more answers and creating new knowledge. My childhood Wikipedia adventures are the reason that, today, research is such a fascinating venture to me. In doing research, reaching the edge isn't the objective, it's only the first step. Digging through the literature is like following every hyperlink in sight, doing my best to grab as much information as I can as you push closer and closer to the edge.When I get there, doing research is choosing a nice spot along the edge, and saying to myself, 'Yes. I think this'll be mine.' Then, I poke and prod at the edge until it budges, even just a teeny tiny bit. And then I've made a permanent contribution. I've pushed past the edge. I've begun to understand something that no one has ever understood before.I've added one more link for the next person who comes along and dares to ask, 'Why?'",,,

240,Admitsee,4,1,,,,,6,"I used to read a book a day. I'd go to the school library, grab a short book, read it during class\u2014under my desk, much to the ire of my teachers\u2014and return it that afternoon. My imagination was filled with talking mice, aliens, knights, and pretentious children. I mastered the art of reading while walking, reading while talking, reading while eating. I would take the worlds I found in books and bring them into imaginary play. The worlds became my own, and I loved the escapism. In third grade, I discovered the public library. The Phantom Tollbooth, with its whimsical setting and poetic characters, inspired me to write my first, albeit terrible, story. The images and beauty of The Golden Compass entranced me, and soon my dreams were filled with armored bears and warrior witches. Beyond stimulating my creativity, books enriched me. Childhood's End, and most sci-fi for that matter, gave me morality, embedded an anti-authoritarian value in me, and informed my personal beliefs about God as strongly as the Bible did. There was one book that fundamentally changed my worldview. Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes challenged my previous views on issues as real as abortion and suicide, and as conceptual as the nature of religion, society, and personal values. Through empathizing with the characters' outsider status and living through their struggles, I became more human. I scorned those who favored their limited plastic screens and valiantly defended my expansive paper pages; that is, until my parents gave me my first computer. The rupture wasn't a drastic cut-off from words, but a slow and sure switch. Why read when you could watch? Why pick up a book when you could scroll? My skills of reading, walking, and eating with a book stayed with me as a phone replaced the novel in my hand. And to further the end of literature, the world became hostile to reading. I was suddenly too old for fantasy and sci- fi. To my peers, Lord of the Rings was cool as long as Peter Jackson was directing it, because who has the time to sit down and focus on one thing at one time? Books are antisocial, your face stuck behind a wall of paper. You should put down that silly nonsense and come have fun. Don't you want to be included? Adults, too, became an enemy of reading. You can't learn anything from a fantasy book. What's the use? It's all made up anyway. Who has the time? You should focus on what matters: school and reality.I read less, watched more. I hadn't completely severed my ties with words. I still read articles, albeit online; read biographies of my heroes, Walt Disney and Jim Henson; and read the books assigned to me by teachers. But to the imaginative worlds of my childhood \u2014 Wonderland, Jordan College, Mars \u2014 I was a stranger.The winter of my junior year, I finished my first fiction book in over three years: The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury. Sure, it was a collection of short stories and not a complete narrative, but when reading and immersing myself in a world where celestial blue orbs are God and rockets full of Edgar Allen Poe's creations ricochet through the sky, I was entranced. I never realized I had stopped reading, and it was not until the final word of the book that the realization dawned on me. I had destroyed what was once the greatest aspect of my personality, and I long more than anything to gain it back. Now, on my bedside table there sits a stack of five or six books, each brimming and pulsating with imaginative stories and beautiful worlds. With limited time between schoolwork and activities, reading these is no easy objective, but I attack it with glee, for I may finally return home to the pages and worlds of which I was born.",,,
241,Admitsee,3,,,,,5,,"With the recent presidential impeachment and the aggravating tension with North Korea, I am a bystander to a turbulent time in modern Korean political history, watching my country walk down a misty road that leads to unknown ends. As a Korean student, my desire to study History, Politics, and International Relations, represents my passion to understand what shaped my country throughout continued internal and external peril.Based on my interest in modern history and politics, I was particularly attracted to the study of imperialism in AP World History. Specifically, by comparing the development of Japan, China, and the Ottoman Empire during the mid-1800s, I was able to understand how western influences changed the regional power dynamics of Asia; how modernization of government institutions, along with advancements in military structure, transportation, and communication, allowed Meiji Japan to grow as an imperial power while other industrialized nations colonized the former great powers of China and the Ottoman Empire. Compared to the way my previous history classes were colored with nationalistic bias - emphasizing the struggles of the colonized states, especially Korea - my AP class allowed me to view the history of East Asia with a broader perspective, helping me understand the specific ways how modernization shaped the colonial and postcolonial world order. As an extension of my interest in historical and political development, I began subscribing to foreign policy journals such as \\\u2018The Diplomat' and \\\u2018Foreign Policy.' A set of articles focusing on the Middle East intrigued me, about how the Obama administration - wishing for a secular, pro-western Syria whilst disregarding the intense religio-political competition between rebel groups - failed to understand the dynamics of Syria and delivered arms to any militants who the US deemed \\\u2018moderate.' Viewing the crisis being mishandled by the 'passivity and abandonment' of the western states, I realized the importance of a multidimensional approach to politics: that a political decision should not be determined only within the realms of government, but should also consider the cultural, religious and historical aspects of the region.These perspectives that I acquired in an academic context were bolstered through a wide range of extracurricular activities. For example, by being selected as a full-scholarship national representative at the Global Classrooms International Model UN in New York, I was able to learn the importance of conventional country-to-country interactions, specifically by successfully mediating different stakeholders at the Security Council and establishing a nonproliferation initiative in North Korea modeled after the Iranian JCPOA. Furthermore, by serving as a full-time intern at Better World, an NGO focusing on international development, I was able to experience the \\\u2018micro' side of international relations. By supporting Samsung's Corporate Social Responsibility projects, I was not only able to make IT education for underprivileged kids in Vietnam and Peru come true, but I also realized the necessity of the non-government sector in attaining international development agendas. Being able to develop a solution for these international issues fascinated me and is the driving force of my eagerness to study international relations, to advance my knowledge from those of a high school student to an advanced level.I wish to study in the UK to better understand how Britain and Europe developed in the midst of foreign and internal crises, just like the struggles East Asia and the world is dealing with at this moment. I am confident that studying in the UK - the birthplace of the industrial revolution and a diverse country consisting of people from around the world - will not only provide me fresh insights about global politics and history, but will also help me in drawing a \\\u2018bigger picture,' for finding the solutions to the problems our world has to solve.",,,

243,Admitsee,3,1,2,,,5,,"My parents have always struggled with English. As a kid, I always thought it was because they didn't watch Dora the Explorer. Yes, that little girl and her anthropomorphic friends were my Rosetta Stone. Born in Cuba, I was deeply engrossed in the culture: I landed in America still singing 'Guajiro Natural,' a song symbolic of Cuban farmer culture. Learning the English language was the first step in my metamorphosis, and Dora was largely responsible for teaching me.Once I became old enough to go to school, my parents were pressured by their friends to put me in an ESL class so I'd be able to adapt more easily. Afraid I'd never fully embrace the English language, they instead thrust me into a kindergarten class where no one ever spoke Spanish. I remember that class fondly, with Ms. Cruz teaching me how to rhyme words like 'bat' and 'cat,' and an end-of-year dance party with dozens of bouncing kids. I had picked up the language easily, as most young children do.I always hated the food at home. Rice, beans, and, depending on what mom decided to cook up, either ground beef, pork ribs, or chicken breast. Blessed were the days when my parents chose to go out to eat at an Italian restaurant or a diner. Pizza, spaghetti, chicken nuggets, french fries: absolute bliss. I was always jealous of my friends who had pasta night every friday, or went out every weekend. McDonald's was a treat. I still salivate over a nice 10-piece McNuggets meal with some fries.At around the age of 8 I ran into another problem. 'Guajiro Natural' just didn't sound so hot anymore. The car radio seemed to be permanently switched to 93.1 Amor, playing what sounded like the same 3 bachata songs on loop, interrupted only by loud, lightning-fast commercials in Spanish selling car insurance or something else an 8-year-old doesn't care about. My friends at school would sing songs in English, songs I'd never had the chance to hear. I would constantly ask my dad to change to Z100 so I could hear the greatest hits of the 2000s or to 106.7 lite fm so I could enjoy some Michael Jackson or Cyndi Lauper. My parents weren't big fans of Z100, but my dad would tell stories of dancing to Michael Jackson and mishearing his lyrics back in Cuba: needless to say, I wound up hearing a lot more MJ than Z100. Everything felt better in English: even the commercials sounded good. I wanted to be an American just like all my friends at school, I wanted to fit in. I remember refusing dance lessons from my mom because I didn't want to 'waste time' learning salsa or merengue.I never had the grandma who baked cookies; mine fried plantain chips. We never had meatloaf night; we ate rice and beans almost daily instead. But after returning to Cuba for the first time, seeing my family and my homeland, my thinking changed. At night the adults would all tell jokes and stories, and I was so happy I could understand them. All these amazing people, and I can call them family? My whole life I've worried about fitting in, scared about how different my culture was. Being different was scary. Only now that I'm older do I realize that I should embrace who I am, where I came from. I've become more and more interested in the Spanish language, constantly asking my parents for new words and explanations of grammar rules. With college on the horizon, I've actually asked my mom to teach me her recipe for rice and beans, and I might have to enroll in her School of Dance one of these days (which happens to double as our living room). And now that I think about it, 'Guajiro Natural' has a pretty nice ring to it after all.",,,
244,Admitsee,3.5,1,,,,,6,"Ink-stained canvas. Gentle strokes of color. A smudge of water. The thin paintbrush permits the precise crafting of mountainous terrain. The warm hues fuse together to form the autumn shades of the maple trees, and the water structures a path for the pigments to chase. 'Paint with grace. Let your fingers do the work,' Mrs. Banks, my 4th grade art teacher, suggested as I watched the colors settle into the fibers of my canvas. In elementary school, I had begged my parents for art lessons. As I got older, my newfound interest became the guitar. Soon enough, a telescope and binoculars were added to my arsenal. In my house, I became a fledgling Van Gogh, a rookie Eddie Van Halen, and an aspirant Galileo. As a child, my muse was discovery; I craved finding new methods of expression and creation. Today, I'm not much of a painter anymore, but I remain an artist. And my palette is composed of two of my lasting discoveries: filmmaking and computer science.Film first entered my life through sci-fi cinema. As a child, I marveled at the droids that could scavenge plant life in Wall-E, the face scans used to enter Star Trek archives, and the Imperial Star Destroyer schematics in every Star Wars film. The fantasies portrayed in these movies were not tangible in the real world, yet the emotions they evoked were the most palpable.Childhood movies dared me to dream, and videography became my medium for sharing these boundless visions. In 11th grade, I was tasked with creating an infomercial for a competitive event in the Technology Student Association. To make up for our lack of lighting and stabilization equipment, my team spent weeks crafting homemade versions. Days later, the holograms and jetpacks I had prototyped in my mind were brought to life in the form of special effects. The seemingly impossible technologies that were once figments of my imagination became realities portrayed on the screen.In high school, programming became another platform where I could bring these visions to life. How could machine learning be used to identify allergens contained in food using only a photograph? Could software provide a platform for local restaurants to reduce food wastage? How could gesture recognition transform the human body into an instrument? Each and every keystroke at Hackathons brought me closer to developing solutions to these complex questions. And while the final results\u2014programs that achieved these lofty goals \u2014were fulfilling, the process itself was most enticing. I find myself zipping through documentation, constantly absorbing new algorithms, and spending endless hours meticulously debugging code. Programming is a constant challenge to the mind, forcing creative and efficient thought, and testing how far I can stretch my limits. Having a foot in both realms has shaped my perspective. As I'm lost in a maelstrom of program failures from an app I'm working on late at night, I funnel the resourcefulness I've acquired through long hours on the film set. As I deliberate the shot composition for the next scene of a video, I balance ambition with the logic and pragmatism I attained through coding. Whether I am producing a promotional video for a client or designing a new software, I continue to channel my newfound mentality in all aspects of my life. Fumbling between activities as a child led to discovering my love for film and computer science, and my childlike delight lingers today. Film will likely remain a hobby for years to come, while continuing to shape how I approach my career in computer science. Yet, even as I dabble in both crafts, I realize that balancing the technical with the creative, the left brain with the right, is an art form that I have yet to master. College is where I will refine this harmony, armed with my camera in one hand and my computer the other.",,,
245,Admitsee,4,1,,,,5,,"Braces!' a voice cries out. I smile warmly as I confusedly try to discover the speaker. Only one person I know would welcome me in such a way.When I returned to Fresh and Green Academy last summer in Ethiopia, my face was still recognizable by one of the students I had taught prior to then\u2014even without my awkward braces. The summer before entering high school, however, did not bring as gracious a welcome. Initially, I was ecstatic to be back where my mother grew up, a place that was meant to be home. While I was eager to dig into the siga-wot (lamb stew) that my grandma had prepared upon my arrival, each piece I scooped up with injera\u2014a traditional delicacy\u2014 left a bitter aftertaste, unlike the one I was used to at home. The bits of Amharic I had gleaned from my mother and aunts' discussions back home were lost in the conversations of my relatives and locals. What I knew, it seemed, only formed a small thread within the cloth of Ethiopian culture.Upon walking through the flimsy tin gate of the school, dozens of nameless faces scrutinized my every step, their uncertain gazes unwavering as they wondered what to make of the stranger that had infiltrated their home. I was an outsider, even with my heritage: at best, another member from the diaspora\u2014 at worst, a complete foreigner.Despite my shortcomings in connecting to cuisine or language, still, I was determined to connect with the people; yet, over the next two months, I soon learned that teaching was not for the faint of heart. Attempts to break up arguments nearly always lead to tears being shed. Chasing down students to get to class meant someone else had an opportunity to sneak out of the classroom while I was away. Games of after-school soccer often left me trying to catch my breath from running in circles around the schoolyard.My difficulty adjusting gave way to a new sense of isolation; but as it turned out, I was not alone in being alone. Yacob, a schoolboy from the countryside, unfamiliar with Addis dialect, would stay inside by himself waiting for the time to pass while other students outside flew across the yard. 'Inihidi,' I reminded him one day, using one of the few words we shared to challenge both of us to 'go' break out of our isolation and join a game of soccer alongside the other kids. During class, when I decided to place students in pairs, he and others were able to get along as they worked together to solve math problems up on the blackboard\u2014language could not bar their collaboration. Whenever my mouth opened to take a bite of injera during lunch, Yacob pointed, mesmerized by the sparkling metal grid arrayed across my teeth, the likes of which he had never before seen. The name 'Braces,' as I told him they were called, seemed to roll off his tongue whenever he spotted me. Both of us, it seemed, were getting used to something new.While I will never forgot the bonds I created with the students that summer, I will always treasure my memories with Yacob. Finding my place as an Ethiopian was about forming true connections that manifest not from our cultures but our shared human experiences. Loneliness, frustration, excitement\u2014these we share regardless of our background . It was this knowledge that later contributed to my connection to the other students. On one of the last days of that first summer, as I turned to exit the school through the same tin gates I had once entered, one of the teachers asked me to stay a little while longer: 'The kids want you to teach my class instead!' Now, I belonged.",,,

247,Admitsee,3.5,,2,,4,5,,"Your dad is leaving for California.'My mom's words dissipated my characteristically cheerful mood; I was shocked. Overcome by a looming sense of loss and powerlessness, I barely heard my parents as they explained that my father was offered a job in California. Unfortunately, due to my mom's work permit restriction, the rest of the family have to stay behind in Massachusetts. As I watched my father board the plane, I felt tears welling in my eyes. My parents had put me in my grandparents' hands as they ventured to the United States when I was one, and I only met them later on. After experiencing the joy of living with them, it hurt to lose my father so soon.Following the separation, I saw my mom's mood decline as she entered a state of constant exhaustion. Apart from her full-time job and household chores, she had to care for my five-year-old brother and me. Noticing her fatigue, I started to bother her less, hoping to lighten the weight on her shoulders. I began to bike to and from school so that she didn't need to drive me. I would return home to an empty house, sweaty and tired, and do my chores so the house would be cleaner when my mom came home.It was then that, to make my evenings more fun, I started to use these chores as an outlet for my creativity. When I vacuumed, I blasted electronic dance music and imagined myself as deadmau5, turning the living room into my stage and the vacuum into my mixer. I did the same when my mom wasn't home, and I cooked dinner for my brother and myself. Then, the kitchen transformed into a laboratory for my mad scientist ideas. I meticulously measured a medley of ingredients with cups and balances, pouring them into a boiling cauldron of noodles. My brother learned to live with my infamous 'Mystery Noodles,' which had ingredients ranging from apple cider to chocolate bars, though my learning process was not without failure. Once, as a fearless pre-teen eager to try out some habanero powder I found in a cabinet, I scooped a generous spoonful into the soup. I spent the rest of that night on the toilet regretting my decision, but that was the price to pay for the joy that I got from my inventive cooking.Exercising my creativity was an unexpected consequence of spending time by myself, but it stuck with me as I translated it to other environments, transforming all tasks into adventures. One of these tasks was doing my math homework. Every time I opened my math book, I entered a world where I was the hero, and each math problem was an evil villain. I slashed fiercely with my pencil, following the technique of powerful formulas, and each solved problem was a small victory against my loneliness. I soon developed a true passion for math and found that the imaginary worlds I fabricated were not enough to fulfill me. I itched to leave the house to attend Mathcounts club meetings, and I would be excited for Fridays afternoons almost exclusively because that's when they took place. Those meetings were spent in deep thinking, laughter, and friendly competitions. I lacked this kind of easy rapport and collaboration at home, and the rarity of the meetings fed my desire to work alongside others. I wished I could have spent more time there, because I realized how much my peers' help and company expanded my mind.I have come to understand that the circumstances I grew up in have shaped me into someone more creative and resourceful than I would have been otherwise. Today, with my dad back in our home, I continue to excel at collaboration and creativity. I feel a deep gratitude toward the sacrifice my parents have made for me, and I look forward to a future with many more academic challenges.",,,
248,Admitsee,3,,,,,5,,"There are 102 seats in my high school theater, and freshman year I was determined to sit in the farthest one from the stage \u2014 seat G1 in the back left corner. It seemed to be the safest hiding place for me, a completely inexperienced member of costume and makeup crew. Still, I couldn't escape hearing my teacher's notes to the actors. 'What's your character's motivation?' she would ask nightly after rehearsal. Why did they move that way or emphasize that word? Can you hint at their backstory? The performers, all upperclassmen who sat as close to the front as possible (A10-A5, B10-B5), would nod and push together their eyebrows, apparently absorbing those questions and vowing to seek some elusive connection with their character. Several rows behind them, I would rest my chin on my palm and get lost in other thoughts, wondering if I would ever worry that much about people's backstories, fictional or otherwise.My detachment was chipped away by nine more shows throughout my freshman and sophomore years, most notably the last one: an election-themed, modern version of Hamlet in the spring of 2016. The timing, cast and crew were all perfect, but I was next up to be costume designer and still felt underprepared. Though I wasn't inexperienced anymore, I had never been faced with skillfully decoding such an iconic piece of literature, nor had I ever had so many people invested in the result.But somewhere in between watching read-throughs, planning quick changes and mapping out the costumes on a spreadsheet (a type-A strategy that I'm still proud of today), something clicked. I realized that every moment in that 4,000-line play had to be analyzed with respect to the characters' personalities and feelings, as well as how these traits affected their style and actions: Would Claudius get his suit personally tailored? Of course. What's Ophelia's signature color? Red \u2014 she needs attention and a little unsettling foreshadowing. And can we please get Hamlet out of those acid wash jeans? He's tragic but not obnoxious. Those moments opened up a whole new kind of learning for me: one that involved not just academic success, but emotional intelligence.Outside the high walls of my school's black box theatre, my underclassmen years let me explore another passion: journalism. Tenth grade had been my first year as news editor for my school paper, and though the articles I wrote were solid, I didn't connect with them on any deep, critical level. When I started my junior year a few months after that critical first gig as costume designer, I found that my approach to reporting was more comprehensive. When I interviewed people for stories in my junior year, I recognized they had their own lives outside of what I wrote about them, and their backgrounds were all inseparable from the stories they shared with me. I wanted to understand how they truly felt \u2014 the dissatisfied parents, the kids who got parking tickets, the undocumented families. I wanted to hear 'both sides,' out of a mixture of journalistic integrity and pure curiosity. Just as my drama teacher had always recommended, I wanted to know their motivation. Reporting in this way will never cease to excite me, and has led me to pursuing journalism as a career. For that reason, I'll always be grateful for the high school play that helped me realize the power of people's words and my ability to understand them.I still don't sit in the front row of my theater, and I probably never will \u2014 it's never been my tendency to settle that close to the spotlight. But I'll always be just a few seats back, watching a story unfold on a stage, and searching for its truth.I started backstage theatre work as an excited but inexperienced freshman on costume and makeup crew. My disorientation was eventually lessened with nine more shows during my underclassman years, a period during which I was promoted from crew member to makeup designer to, finally, costume designer. I'll admit that this initial rise was more due to quick dedication, reliability and attention to detail than artistic skill; a less kind critic might describe it as an instance of 'fake it \\\u2018til you make it.' The real turning point came at the end of my sophomore year: a politically-charged, modern day version of Hamlet, which my first show as costume designer. Between watching read-throughs and planning quick changes and mapping out outfits on a spreadsheet (a type-A strategy that I'm still proud of today), something clicked. I realized that every moment in that 4,000-line play had to be analyzed with respect to the characters' personalities and feelings, as well as how these traits affected their style and actions: Would Claudius get his suit personally tailored? Of course. What's Ophelia's signature color? Red, she needs attention and a little violent foreshadowing. And can we please get Hamlet out of those acid wash jeans? He's tragic but not obnoxious.This strategy of actively placing myself in each character's shoes has shaped the rest of my work in theatre and beyond. After Hamlet, I began to see theatre differently. It's not just a hobby - it's an all-in-one, microcosmic crash course on everything from history to literature analysis to audio-visuals to interpretations of life itself. As a costume designer, my work has the potential to profoundly influence or manipulate the audience's perception of each character. Moreover, the emotional intelligence I have gained from critically reading these stories has made me a more empathetic person, not to mention a more analytical writer and journalist. Costume design has not only opened my eyes to the world of theatre arts, but also allowed me to explore the human condition through a countless variety of lenses and outfits.",,,

250,Admitsee,4,,2,3,,5,,"With a loud bang, my mom rushes through the door and beelines to the kitchen. As the only adult in the house, she is solely responsible for dinner, rapidly chopping carrots and onions. I pause tinkering with my Lego roller coaster to help her wash and cut more vegetables, while she deftly assembles the ingredients into oxtail soup.With four hands, our mandatory family dinner is ready just in time before I'm whisked away to evening activities.As I grew older, I upgraded my Legos to Arduinos but continued to play the role of chef. One particularly lazy day, I longed to cook our favorite oxtail soup in a new slow-cooker but knew that I would forget the precise five-hour cooking time. I put my tinkering to use, fashioning my Arduino and a few household parts into a timer for the slow- cooker's outlet. My mom brightened when she saw the makeshift contraption, extending it to hassle-free rice porridges and beef stews. As we ate these perfectly timed dishes, I tasted the savory satisfaction of solving problems with technology.My propensity to tinker thrived through sophomore year when I jumped at an opportunity to join a college hackathon, hoping to investigate problems beyond my kitchen. My team agreed on my high school's most pressing issue: lack of collaboration. Students often discussed creative innovations but struggled to find teammates and mentors to get started. Just as with the slow-cooker, I turned to technology to tackle this problem.I sought out hackathon mentors to learn UX\/UI design and attended workshops to explore web-development frameworks. My team eventually developed SchoolGround, a web-app for finding teammates with diverse skillsets.Filled with excitement from creating SchoolGround out of nothing, I spent the next few weeks surveying my school's student body for feedback. However, I discovered that my web-app didn't make supportive groups for teammates to work together, it only enhanced the process. This seemed like a need that technology couldn't solve, no matter how many features I added. I remembered my college hackathon experience\u2014it was the people and dynamics that enabled me to bring my ideas to life. Something clicked in my mind. I needed to approach the collaboration problem from a different angle: the social side. And I couldn't think of anything better than providing a hackathon dedicated to high schoolers.I launched Hack New England High Schools (hackNEHS) and enlisted like-minded peers to join the organizing team. Through countless Skype calls to prepare for the event, I shifted our focus from typical talk of purchasing Arduinos to socially-focused considerations. I pinpointed the Microsoft conference center for our venue, impressed by its open spaces and round tables that encouraged discussion. With beginners in mind, I planned in-hackathon workshops, from learning web-development to data visualization. I secured Catapult Incubator as a sponsor to provide mentorship and grants for winning teams continuing their projects. I was nervous we hadn't provided enough pajamas and Soylent\u2014essential elements for brainstorming sessions\u2014when hundreds of participants showed up at the venue. It was soon dispelled as teams sketched out flowcharts on every open whiteboard while our Ideation Workshop quickly reached max-capacity. Gathering a group of mentors, I dashed around to address raised hands.The venue came alive during the final presentations as teams demonstrated projects ranging from ping-pong VR games to study music generators. Afterwards, I was thrilled when students from my school came up to me seeking advice to continue their projects and maintain their team beyond the hackathon. I was convinced that I had achieved my personal goal of helping my school develop that collaborative spirit. I also saw people I didn't know before\u2014new friends\u2014pitching to each other while sharing pizza. This enthusiasm reminded me that I needed to think beyond technology to solve social problems. More importantly, I realized that helping my mom in the kitchen or making an impact in my community gave me real joy.",,,
251,Admitsee,4,,2,,4,5,,"The barrage of reciprocative outcries coming from downstairs woke me up violently. Oh no, not again. I clambered out of bed and stumbled towards the family room. Sprinting down the stairs, I found my mom screaming desperately at my frenzied dad, the beer bottles scattered across the floor decidedly confirming my suspicions. I rushed in, straining with what little might I had to push them apart and lead my mom away.At ten years old, I learned to associate dad and beer with mom and yelling. It upset me to see my mom distressed, and I wanted to assuage her unremitting pain. I pleaded with my dad to stop drinking, but he simply chuckled and patted me on the head, assuring me that I was too young to understand. Glancing over at my mom, who sat silently with her lips pursed and her eyes cast down at the coffee table, I opened my mouth to argue, only to find I didn't know what else to say.Throughout middle school, I devoured any research or news related to drinking, most of which determined alcohol consumption was harmful. The evidence and my confidence mounted, culminating in a presentation in which I laid out the body of literature in front of my dad and requested that he seriously consider cutting back on his drinking\u2014 this time without my mom in the room for fear of instigating the habitual argument between them. He conceded that his drinking was indeed an issue and agreed to stop once and for all. 'Mom will be so happy to hear this. Thanks, dad. I love you,' I said with my face buried in his chest and my arms wrapped around his waist.I would've loved to end the story right then and there, but alas, that wasn't the case. Months passed and he made no visible attempt to change his habits in spite of my persistence. I came to realize that simply convincing him drinking was harmful wasn't going to flip a switch and galvanize him into action. Empirical evidence and logical reasoning were fundamental to my argument, but I would need to tap into his emotions if I wanted to inspire him to act out his promises.A few weeks prior to his 50th birthday, I decided this source of inspiration would come in the form of a gift. After all, this unceremonious transition into old age naturally prompts a reassessment of one's health. I recruited my melodramatic little sister to help me design and film a comedic mini-movie advocating a healthy lifestyle and specifically denouncing alcohol as a threat to one's well-being. The product? A series of skits that involved me performing sumo squats with ten-pound dumbbells and my sister hurling beer bottles into the trash can.On the night of his birthday, I scrambled back from my room to the coffee table, fumbling my MacBook between my hands and running every possible ending to the story in my mind. Would I finally be the hero or was I doomed to fail again?I clicked the play button with a trembling pointer finger, and almost immediately, my dad launched into a peal of roaring laughter that slowly abated as he pieced together the underlying message. As the progress bar inched towards the right edge of the screen, he turned to face us, an unmistakable look of conviction in his eyes.Pulling me into his embrace, he patted me on the back and whispered into my ear over and over that I was right all along. I turned to look at my mom, my gaze meeting hers, and the tears she fought so hard to hold back began to trickle down her cheeks, liberated at last.",,,
252,Admitsee,3.5,1,,,,,6,"Everyone has a happy place.I ran to my closet and slid down the wall. My sweat coagulated with dust as I closed the door and found myself in darkness. I heard a faint, wood-splintering invasion at my door and a pounding in my heart.  Inhale. One, two, three. Exhale. Go to your happy place.Mine used to be some anonymous beach, one that would probably appear in a glossy brochure for Aruba. Upon each visit, it became more decayed from the last. Its white shores became splotched with wildlife victimized by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, its lightly salted air thickened with tense diplomatic relations, its wispy, clear horizons threatened with nuclear warfare. Eventually, my 'happy place' became an ironic and unwelcome reminder of precisely everything about the world that I wanted to escape. In a time when the motifs of my life were slammed doors and police disturbance reports, I needed a happy place more than ever.This is when Netflix entered my life; it became my new escape from reality. Instead of isolating myself in darkness to a fantasy land, my eyes widen at the endless expanse of possibilities for my streaming purposes, and for the world, all at finger's touch away. Synonymous with lazy weekends and a minimal brain cell requirement, Netflix is the pinnacle of the new millennium. It's fed by the American adoration for 'couch potato syndrome.' But I don't love Netflix because it's easy. On the contrary, growing up streaming instead of (channel) surfing excavated my inner curiosity.  I can't help but wonder if Pam-and-Jim love will be able to persist in a world increasingly defined by designer babies and swipe-right love connections; It's crippling to realize that consumeristic culture has made our values as fleeting as the character features in a season of Grey's Anatomy; The unexpected consequences of Barry Allen's time travel make me consider the risks of geoengineering; The frustratingly obvious passion in Rachel and Ross's convoluted relationship corroborates David Foster Wallace's point\u2014the most ubiquitous realities are hardest to see.The mishaps of Ted Mosby, the schemes of Neal Caffrey, and the adventures of Kimmy Schmidt move me from my traumas\u2014the way my nose hairs curled in protest as my brother's gasoline-sodden bed lit up upon contact with a measly match, the emptiness I felt when I walked home from school to find Child Protective Services in my driveway\u2014and inspire me to be a relentless inquisitor. Netflix secures that complacently accepting any idea as fact or any proposal as sure-fire is impossible.  My endeavors, leisurely and intellectual, transform into interrogative ones. Whether at a cross-country race examining the effect of mob mentality, or a Model U.N. conference pondering the reach of national sovereignty, I push to understand the nuances of the world\u2014much like I push to watch so many consecutive episodes of Psych that even Netflix doesn't believe I'm still there.  Where I find my next query\u2014be it existential, plot-driven, research, or trivial\u2014I don't know. What I do know, however, is that it's soon to come, and it will come driven by the unfettered thinking Netflix cultivated in me. With an internet connection and $8.99\/month, I'm granted the ability to no longer simply escape reality\u2014a once- necessity now reclassified as a part of my past\u2014but to rebuild it upon infinitudes of hypotheticals.  Essentially, Netflix taught me that the key to understanding the world is to not. Uncertainty is, in fact, a certainty\u2014whether it be simultaneously knowing a particle's exact position and momentum, or finishing off a season with a cliffhanger. I've adopted my curiosity\u2014led by what some see as idleentertainment, but what I've come to recognize as an encyclopedia of the world\u2014to come to terms with this. My newfound perspective shapes who I am today: in the face of adversity, I don't recede into darkness. Now, I charge head-first (and with a notepad of questions) into the abyss of ambiguities.",,,
253,Admitsee,3.5,,2,3,,5,,"React or Act Standing in front of my peers at the 'Back to School' assembly, my principal has called me out by name.  I feel myself begin to blush.  I don't consider myself to be a shy kid, but having the whole school staring at me is slightly out of my comfort zone.  I begin to reflect on the events of the past week, guided by a single question, 'How in the world did I get here?' Twitter was abuzz.  The school administration had sent out the 'Welcome to the Start of the Year!' email with some earth-shattering news.  With pitchforks in hand, students took their protest to the 140-character forum, tweeting things such as, 'How can they do this to us?' and 'That's not fair!'  Why was everyone up in arms?  Instead of distributing our lockers by class, the administration planned to assign them randomly, co-mingling the freshmen with seniors, seniors with juniors, and juniors with sophomores, breaking a beloved tradition that had been in place since the school's founding in 1964.  One could only imagine the disaster that would ensue from this decision: Seniors towering over intimidated freshmen, classes no longer growing together, and the rite of passage for juniors to move into senior hall\u2026  DENIED!  But instead of impulsively reacting, I thought about what I could do to take action.  The next morning, armed with my computer and a blank Word document, I prepared for battle.  My fingers flew across the keyboard as I typed every reason why the lockers should be grouped by class.  Honestly, I didn't believe my plea would change anything, but as I finished typing the letter a little voice in my head told me, 'Send it.'  As I clicked save, I realized that just a letter to the administration wasn't enough to speak on the behalf of the entire student body.  Searching for a solution, I converted the letter into a petition and began to send it out to my fellow classmates.  To my surprise, the petition generated a considerable amount of attention.  Kids that I barely knew were messaging me, wondering what they could do to help.  I couldn't believe this was happening.  Before I knew it, I went from being the kid on the debate team to the most sought after individual in school.  Knowing that my peers trusted me to get the job done was both humbling and empowering at the same time.On the first day of school, I navigated my way through the maze of classrooms.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the principal\u2026 and he was walking straight towards me!  By the look on his face, I thought this was the end of Luke Lamey.  To my relief, he commended me for raising awareness in a thoughtful and compelling manner and said that the administration was to hold a meeting to discuss the locker issue.  My simple petition had gone from being hopeless to hopeful, which was an accomplishment in itself.  While no change had occurred, the fact that this issue was being talked about was enough to validate my efforts.So this is how I got here, standing in front of my peers at the 'Back to School' assembly.  Our principal announces that our voices have been heard, and the lockers will be organized by class.  As my peers stand and cheer, I'm not sure what I should do.  Do I pump my arms and strike a pose like Usain Bolt?  Do I thrust my fist in the air in victory?  No, that's not who I am.  I just stand and smile back at all the faces cheering for me\u2026 for us\u2014we did it!Now, am I able to solve all of the world's problems?  No, but I wish I could.  Am I willing to do what it takes to improve the world around me?  Absolutely.",,,

Passengers pour from the vessel, my cue to begin a five-minute talkathon.As the tourists flock around me, I begin: 'Welcome to Alcatraz Island!' Eyes squint in my direction. I resist the urge to open with some island trivia or a joke about prison fashion. I've been trained\u2014stick to the script. The crowd fidgets tirelessly\u2014pushing back hair, digging for sunglasses, peeling away overcoats. 'Please do not pick up any rocks, plants, or feathers. This is a national park. We try to leave everything the way we find it.' My voice over the loudspeaker sounds tinny. I feel like the newest Alcatraz warden, and can only imagine what the inmates think of my rules.Growing up, I sought out experiences for their outcomes, trusting life's rules of reward. A longtime gymnast, I hurled myself backwards on the balance beam because I knew it would make me stronger mentally, physically, and emotionally. In ninth grade, I ate a live scorpion at a street stand in Beijing, deciding that having license to the story was worth the horrid taste. I followed paths that were sure to yield desired results and opted against pursuing those that wouldn't. Relying on the predictable, I failed to realize the world simply isn't.Working on Alcatraz sounded ideal: showing people Al Capone's cell and where he played his banjo at night, trying to decipher various foreign languages, meeting visitors from Milan and Tokyo and Cordoba all in the same day, and exploring the psychology of human confinement. But instead, here I was, prying federally-protected pebbles out of confused children's hands.As I finish my orientation and send visitors up the hill, a few people linger. Most ask a simple question and rush off, but for those who stay, I pick up a conversation. I ask them where they're from, and joke to visitors from Australia that they must've brought the sunny weather with them. I recommend to a German family that they visit Pier 33's bakery when they dock to try my favorite chocolate muffins. A woman asks me if the DeYoung is worth a visit and before long begins recounting her memory of peering through the window of her father's car at the age of nine. It was then that she observed the urban decay of Baltimore for the first time. The image inspires her work as a volunteer in public schools to this day. I listen as an older man reminisces about his wedding day in 1958, his enthusiasm evident in the jiggle of loose skin below his chin. He insists my wedding day will be the most important day of my life. A twenty-something man dressed as if for a business meeting takes out his Apple earpiece to tell me that he once worked in retail, but decided to return to school to get a degree in library science; it changed his life for the better.My job isn't what I'd imagined. But somehow, the script led me to the accidental, to hundreds of new people, and to the understanding that the most memorable outcomes are those unexpected. Whether it's sending an unprompted email to a neuroscience professor, or daring to sing 'El Mismo Sol' at karaoke night in Canc\u00fan, I've come to do rather than not do, to savor each moment's opportunity without knowing where it might lead. An unexpected friendship, a research opportunity. Small talk might just lead to real talk. I can never predict which first step will lead to another, nor which conversation, which hour, will matter in the end. The treasures never come labeled that way.Out on the bay, I see another ferry approaching. I smile as I unlatch the microphone from the prison wall.",,,

My sandals, trying their best to shield my feet, ran into all sorts of quagmire on the way as cement, oil, rain, and occasional dog-poop enveloped my bubble of typical upper-middle-class elitism. For those five minutes, my existence became secluded to a mere 100 metre long stretch in the middle of an abandoned industrial settlement, as I prodded against nature's adversity during the consecutive sultry weeks of my internship as the youngest student volunteer from Mumbai at Goonj, an internationally recognised non-profit organisation. Probably it was the contentment that lulled me to sleep each night, knowing that if I was able to battle the torrential downpour today, tomorrow wouldn't be worse. Normally, I would take to my heels the moment it started pouring; but that by-lane offered me something much beyond a muddy deluge- a triumph in endeavour. You know the feeling you get, when you are grappling against a peevish dog on your trail, mist and dust in your eyes, Kendrick Farris' appreciation-worth load on your shoulders, an umbrella effortlessly breaking your sweaty palm's tenacious hold, while potholes stymie your gait at every step. But it dawns upon me the very instant, the picture of a hundred beaming underprivileged children, wearing hundred glasses on their noses and a hundred smiles on their faces as they saw the beauty and vivacity of this world. I imagine a dozen girls, wearing a dozen garbs of female honour, as those pads became instruments of breaching the Indian-rural orthodox. I visualise an arsenal of villagers in my country, hand-in-hand, constructing toilets and roofs in their nests, with money that I collect. And for that, I must be prepared to see and bear this fury of nature, at least for five minutes.  'The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.' - Bertrand Russell, The Triumph of Stupidity  One of the most intriguing ideas of life that make it novel and challenging for me each fleeting minute, is Uncertainty. Hitherto embalmed by over-protective walls of certainty- be it the menu choice at \\\u2018Zaffran', or preparing to ace my Calculus test, or culling out my traditional kurta-pyjamas during Diwali- at no point in time had I felt the need to teeter between dilemmas, knowing I must choose the road always taken. But when your decisions fail you, and each following step is no less precarious than the former, and the only thing you are ever momentarily certain about is the uncertain lack of ground beneath your feet, a seed of observation and judgement germinates in that dead mud. The dilemma of resisting a spot over stepping on it gave me the smallest form of adventure and self-dependence, spewing life into my mummified spirit of certainty.  In that daily term of five minutes, I often met a friend. He was a passionate poet, a logician who found inspiration for life in the most obvious things: a multi-faceted Rubik's cube, or a coiled spring, or even a boggy lane- something I would never normally view. As I hummed my favourite Bollywood-song, my scientist pondering over prospective electromagnetic de-siltation of the sewer using Einstein-Stokes models, the archaic poet gesticulates to me, prompting to find a reason in this pursuit, a reason for the determination. I am tempted to peep inside me while meteorological vagaries continue; the poet has already begun composing\u2026'Concerned we are about rewards for the character, not poetic justice for the society that shapes the character'.   The five minutes burgeoned into a year. The reckoning scientist and the beckoning poet joined hands, as I began the Dahisar River Cleaning Project, my new reason to wade in mud. But my contentment and uncertainty persist, knowing that poetic justice is still a long way: I need many more such five minutes.",Showing,Setting,

Three years ago, my dad traveled to Iran for the first time since escaping the 1979 revolution. After he returned, he sat me down to share the story of how he visited his childhood home, elementary school, and most importantly, his father. When they reunited, things were different. They were in a hospital, Grandpa unable to differentiate my dad from the doctors around him.'Do you remember who this is?' my dad asked, showing an old family photograph. After moments of silence, Grandpa replied, 'That's Ayoub, my eldest son.' He whispered my dad's name like a secret, fearing that someone would hear him and take away the memory. It gave my dad hope that Grandpa still remembered him. But the next question proved devastating. 'Where is he now?' Grandpa asked, unaware that his son sat right beside him. It was then that my dad finally accepted that Grandpa had Alzheimer's Disease. As my dad shared the story, I wondered: would this ever repeat itself between us? That moment set me on a journey to learn about Alzheimer's. I discovered that 44 million people had the disease, which is more than prostate and breast cancer combined. Worst of all, Alzheimer's is hereditary, meaning my dad may suffer the same fate as my grandpa. This realization terrified me. More importantly, it inspired me to take action.But inspiration meant nothing without innovation. As a 17-year-old, the odds were against me to cure an age-old disease. I didn't have the experience of a doctor, knowledge of a professor, or deep pockets of an executive. So I had to think creatively. Ultimately, I found the answer where I spend nearly three hours a day: the race track. As captain of the track and field team, I used my leadership position for a greater purpose and initiated a statewide race called Ready, Set, Glow: The 5K To Cure Alzheimer's Disease. A glow-in-the-dark charity run, Ready Set Glow's mission was to fundraise for Alzheimer's research and shine a light \u2014 both literally and figuratively \u2014 on the disease.The experience catapulted me outside my comfort zone. I cold-called organizations like the Alzheimer's Association to sponsor us. I worked with my district's Athletic Department to partner with four other schools across the state. I mobilized my track teammates to plaster posters around town and run door-to-door to encourage sign-ups. For months, I routinely checked Ready Set Glow's registration page, eager to see the $20 sign-ups come in. Each dollar felt like we were buying minutes of memory for loved ones. Ultimately, we raised $5,246, recruiting 176 runners and a handful of donors.As I plan next year's Ready Set Glow race, I try to remember the greater takeaway here. It's not just about how much we fundraised. Nor is it about how many runners came together in the freezing Chicago weather. The takeaway is that age is no excuse for inaction. Most of us are paralyzed by our dreams. We wait until we're ready to make a difference. We convince ourselves that we're not old enough. Not wise enough. Not tough enough. Or at least that's how I felt before starting Ready Set Glow. Today, my inner voice is stronger. It tells me to seize opportunities. Or better yet, to create them. In college, I'm excited to strengthen this inner voice even further and work with other students so we can create a better tomorrow. Together, we'll solve the most idealistic problems \u2014 and hopefully, assure that fathers around the world will never forget their daughters' names.",,,

266,Admitsee,3.5,1,,,,,,"My hand began to twitch as it brought itself closer to my lips. I knew this wasn't right, yet I couldn't resist. I mustered all the willpower embedded into every cell of my anatomy in an attempt to distance my fingertips from my mouth, but to no avail. It was inevitable. After days of self-restraint, I would relapse yet again. I abstained for so long, but no amount of strength in this universe was able to hold me back from this temptation. The constant finger-tapping and the endless gum-chewing were all for nothing as I surrendered to my cravings and chipped away at my nails once again.The act of nail-biting may seem unorthodox to some, but to me, the sensation it provoked was remarkably satisfying. The relief that it triggered would provide me with an immense joy, yet no amount of joy could quite mask the guilt that would come to parade my conscience afterwards. I was more than eager to ruin my hard-work and discipline in order to experience a measly thirty seconds of pleasure as I chomped on my fingernails;'Why are humans so irrational?' I thought to myself, feeling ashamed of my nonsensical whims and desires. I allowed the problem to fester, ultimately reaching a point whereby it became subconscious \u2013 I would sit at my desk, pondering the countless reasons as to why this was a terrible habit, ironically whilst biting my nails. By that point, it had become second nature, an act that was incorporated into each and every aspect of my daily life.Regardless, I was not prepared to admit defeat. I knew that I was stronger than this.\\\u2018I shall not allow one minor setback to stop me from overcoming this unhealthy habit',I reiterated as I reflected on what had just occurred. A different approach was needed to ensure that this mishap would cease to repeat itself, and so I began to search online for an answer. I read somewhere that 50% of adolescents regularly bite their nails, a discovery which furthered my drive to end my addiction as I refused to become another statistic.After hours of flipping through dermatology books in the hopes of finding a remedy to rid me of this god-forsaken habit, I stumbled upon a seemingly plausible - yet peculiar - solution: applying bitter tasting nail polish to my fingernails.I found this cure to be rather unusual, a strange excursion of which I would be the pioneer. I toyed with the idea at first, fearful of the slight chance that it would fail andin turn takeme right back to square one. Nevertheless, after swallowing my doubts, I embarked on my journey.As each day passed, it proved easier and easier to refrain. Were there times I would slip up? Of course! However, I realized that setbacks are an integral part of success. Initially, I would ignore the bitter taste and continue to chew and bite, but after a bit of adjustment - and much ingested nail polish - I realized that the meager reward was not worth the suffering. Eventually, nail-biting was demoted from its status as second nature, and cast out into the abyss of forgotten habits. Thanks to a combination of creativity, determination, and perseverance, I was able to surmount the initial hurdles and continue on the path of triumph. Here I am, two years later, with not the slightest clue as to what fingernails even taste like.",,,

268,Admitsee,3.5,,2,,,,,"I take cold showers. Several years back, the water heater in my house broke, and for weeks, bathing in freezing water was my reality. Although it took some getting used to, I discovered that there's something refreshing about being drenched in icy droplets. And so, even after the water heater was repaired, I kept the habit. To this day, each time I step in the shower, I first turn the knob to the cold side. More than just being refreshing and energizing, though, the cold shower has changed the way I approach life.The worst part about showering in cold water is the moment right before taking the plunge. As soon as you hop in, however, your body quickly adjusts to the temperature, and it's not so bad the rest of the way. For me, stepping into the cold water means resolve; it's getting over the hesitation that comes from knowing I'm about to do something uncomfortable. One of my first 'cold shower' moments came on my first day working at my local aquatics center. In the middle of my shift, I heard shouting outside on the pool deck. Walking onto the pool deck, I saw that parents were yelling at one of our swim instructors. With three adults yelling at each other, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to intervene and try to help. After all, I was a 15-year-old working his first day at his first job. But with our manager out for the weekend, I was the only other employee on site. I knew this could also be a chance for me to prove myself as a new employee. So, taking a deep breath, I walked up to the parents to ask how I could help.In an eardrum-shattering rage, they explained that their son's swim lesson registration hadn't gone through in the computer system. So, a bit flustered, I apologized for the problem and offered to give their son a free swim lesson to compensate for her troubles. Surprisingly, they accepted and immediately calmed down, apologizing for raising their voices. I was struck by how a simple act of stepping forward and being understanding changed the entire dynamic of that confrontation.Another cold shower moment came a few months later at school, when I asked for an internship after a career day presentation. One of the speakers was a manager at a large Silicon Valley venture capital firm. The more she talked about her job, the more I became intrigued. Since I had an interest in economics as well as technology, working at a venture capital firm seemed like the perfect place for me. So I decided that I was going to ask the speaker if her company hired interns.As I approached her, however, I was a bit apprehensive. After all, why would a successful business woman offer a job to an inexperienced high schooler? Still, gathering up my courage, I took the plunge, walked up to her, and introduced myself. We ended up having a fascinating conversation, and, to my surprise, she agreed to interview me for an internship. That summer, I ended up having the opportunity to work for her firm.I've come to realize that good things happen to those who are willing to be uncomfortable and step into uncertainty. In college and life, I know that I will encounter many opportunities as well as challenges. But when I am, I'll know that success comes from embracing whatever hesitance comes and taking action anyway. Cold showers have taught me to face the uncomfortable with poise and confidence.",,,

270,Admitsee,4,1,,,4,,6,"The human mind is a beautifully complex thing in which there lies a minimal distinction between pure genius and absolute insanity. My father is a man of the highest intellect who fell victim to event-induced psychosis; the stress of his work caused him to blur this line.I was not rushed into independence prematurely as most children of the physically or mentally disabled are\u2014my bills were always taken care of and my mother ensured that a home cooked meal always waited for me on the dinner table. Rather, it was the intellectual growth through which I had to forge my own path. It was an ironic paradox: my father, educated at some of the most prestigious universities in the world, was unable to sit down and explain answers to the simple questions I was always asking: Why does cutting onions make mom so sad? Why am I pushed backward when a car starts? Why does my skin shrivel after a long bath? These topics were far too simple for the limitless imagination that plagued my father's mind. He would rather spend his time torn between analyzing the physics of the fourth dimension, debating whether or not he was being filmed through government-owned cameras in our showerheads, and falsely accusing my mom of repeated infidelity because of the wrinkles he found in his sheets late at night. For someone whose mind was stretched so thin just differentiating between fiction and reality, I could hardly blame him for the ignorance he felt toward the simplicities of vectors and middle school biology.'Sabina, just figure it out,' was a sentence I heard frequently. And that's precisely what I learned to do. A world of self-indulging education characterized by bike rides to the local library and the tremendously reliable Internet explained to me the chemistry of onions, the physics of inertia, and dermatology's relation to the nervous system.But as I grew older, my questions grew increasingly complex, and the Internet and library books no longer appeased me. What is the true purpose of the education system, and is it really effective? How important is a balanced arts education in a place like the Silicon Valley? And, most ambiguous of all: how do you define love, and can it be obligatory?In middle school, I began creative writing. My mediums ranged from the inside of my arm, a receipt wedged between my car seat and door, and occasionally, when I was lucky enough to hold my thoughts for substantial enough periods of time, my journal. I have found that even if my questions aren't countered with an immediate answer, writing them down is a first step. It can fill in the grays when I can't yet find my own colors; it's a way for me to synthesize thought processes in succinct, effective ways that make me a sharper thinker and better communicator. When I couldn't comprehend the massive implications of science's latest breakthroughs, I imagined a world where technology advanced faster than humans could keep up. I jotted ideas on the back of a McDonald's napkin: What would life be like in a world where computers were capable enough to overthrow humans? Is that even possible in the foreseeable future? These questions eventually unfolded into my first novel: a science fiction in which I managed to fathom answers to these questions on my own. So, yes, maybe the universe lacks a guide to the galaxy, but at the very least I'll always have a pen and the infinite expanse of a napkin from the nearest fast food restaurant.In the midst of this ambiguity, one thing is certain: my father has transformed me into someone capable of discovering clarity on my own. Inertia may push me backward when a car starts, but it fails to prevent me from moving forward, demanding answers, and, occasionally, creating on them own. My father may not have taken me on road trips, asked me how my day was, or helped me with math homework, but he has granted me the gift of self-driven curiosity\u2014one I am unequivocally grateful for.",,,

I've sampled the various theories of urban planning, savored Khachaturian's vivacious compositions, and snacked on Dante's complex Divine Comedy. I've taken a crack at playing the guitar, tried my hand at painting, and even experimented with gardening. I learnt that soccer is not my forte \u2013 after clumsily dislocating my kneecap during a match. I've played with code and developed a penchant for the French language. I've delved into the worlds of science fiction and classical literature alike.

I teach to invest in the world \u2013 to sow the seeds that will bear the fruit of the future.I teach to interweave theory and practice \u2013 to help guide one through the labyrinth of information.I teach to spark interest in others \u2013 to create an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. To cultivate a voracious desire to learn that will ultimately unmask one's true potential \u2013 one's true calling.I may be a student, a son, a brother, a pianist, a scientist, and a chef.But before all else, I am unequivocally a teacher.Talk about an Extracurricular activity that is particularly meaningful to you:I first dived into the world of computer hardware the night before my AP Psychology exam when I built my first computer. The whole process \u2013 meticulously placing the components into the case, navigating the tiny wires into their sockets, and nervously trying to find misplaced screws \u2013 captivated me.In the UAE, where it is outright taboo for minors to work, I sell computers to help finance my education.However, despite my enthusiasm for computers, the most rewarding aspects of my work are my face-to-face interactions and conversations with customers that allow a glimpse into the multifaceted viewpoints of the expat community. Over the last two years, I have met people from diverse fields in life, often listening to their stories and sharing mine. Building computers has not only allowed me to become self-supporting, but it has also entertained my curiosity for the world and those around me.Oh, the places I'll go I dream of all day.",,,

274,Admitsee,3.5,,,,,5,,"Watch out in Chinatown\u2026.' Warned my dad, letting his sincere worry and his black and white perspectives weigh on the stress of each syllable. Because Dad was born and raised amongst Chinese people on Chinese soil, in less than affluent Chinese neighborhoods, I was initially confused as to which aspect of his racial, social, and economic bias I was to contend with this morning. Mom, who sought to soften the brewing exchange, whispered, 'Remember whenBaba owned those stores. The robberies really changed him\u2014go easy on him.' I nodded in deference to his experience and out of respect for my parents' struggle, yet as I crossed the Golden Gate Bridge that led from our comfortable suburb into the colorful neighborhoods of San Francisco, I felt invigorated by vibrant chaos.I park in the thick of an urban environment, senses assailed by rapid-fire bargaining and shrill, thousand-year-old street instruments. I turn into an alleyway and happen upon a small shop-front jutting into the street; the vendor sits in quiet but vigilant sentry, prone perhaps to the same shopkeeper prejudices as my father.'Hi! Excuse me, Ma'am. May I take your portrait?' I begin hesitantly but with typical enthusiasm. She looks around cautiously, patting her wallet in uncertain strokes as she assesses her level of safety via my propensity for mischief, here in her Chinatown alleyway: Tourist? Scammer? New variety of young miscreant? I can see her thoughts. 'Student!' I offer earnestly. If she agreed, it would be my third successful street interview of the day.  'Sorry, but what is this for?' She asks in Mandarin. Delighted by the switch to my mother tongue as perhaps my 'in', I explain the premise of my project. Inspired by Brandon Stanton and the Humans of Ithaca initiative I started for the newspaper club at Cornell Summer College, I took a risk, a departure from what I knew. I designed a project utilizing the medium of street photography and interviews to capture the living creature that is Chinatown.Elusive, intriguing, and often misunderstood, Chinatown would be presented on her own terms by her own people, through my open eyes and ears.  On any other day, I, like anyone else walking through Chinatown, may have passed the world-weary shopkeeper, but today, I began an exchange, 'May I take your portrait?' After my explanation, she seemed satisfied and began a narrative that struck me as crucial to our history as Asians, as Americans, as human beings. As the photographs and interviews began to accumulate, I realized just how significant my project, the people, had become to me.These tiny pockets of life brimmed with collective experience, and I've discovered how connected we all are, how far a smile goes, and how actively engaging is akin to respecting and understanding.Each day, I start with a simple question.I approach street cleaners, shopkeepers, musicians, and tattooed alleyway dwellers. I strive to discover the commonalities that bind our collective experiences, and to comprehend the divisive differences that further misunderstanding and fear.  I am extending my haunt to include other flourishing neighborhoods including the cherry-blossomed Japantown, tie-dyed Haight, and jazzy Fillmore. I am rejected just as much as I am permitted, which has taught me the art of acceptance and the importance of true communication on equal footing. Today, however, was a good day \u2013 three portraits, three stories, three new perspectives. As my understanding broadens, I see San Francisco winking at me through its idiosyncratic denizens, each a microcosm of the world. I offer these stories, which inspired my film Tang, as a conversation starter, a multicolor lens to layer over sepia, over black and white. As I raise my camera to immortalize another human experience in still frame, I can't help but grin. 'Xie xie.' I say; 'thank you.' Through this experience, we are each a face saved from anonymity\u2014street photographer, subject, and audience alike.",,,
275,Admitsee,3.5,,,3,,5,,"When I began high school in the heart of downtown Portland, my daily commutes revealed something I had never noticed before. Nestled in the shadows of Chinatown was a thriving homeless camp, sharply juxtaposed with the abandoned buildings right next door. Although the camp was surrounded by a rainbow of vibrant signs, I saw adults huddled underneath what looked like oversized tables protected only by tarps. What I found most shocking was that despite living along Portland's busiest road in broad daylight, they were still invisible to the world around them. My shock quickly turned into a desire to get to know the individuals and their stories hidden behind the signs. So, after asking how to help, I began volunteering at a local family shelter. Expecting to see somber faces, I was met with unexpected laughter and warmth.I learned that contrary to what I see on my daily commutes, the average age of a person experiencing homelessness in the US is just nine years old. Only a year younger than me, Norena was the oldest of the kids in shelter. She was the big sister, introducing me to the younger kids like they were family. Whether it was taking the time to read to Lucas or spending the entire day with Kayla to create a puppet show out of paper sacks and googly eyes, Norena always put the kids above herself.As we bonded over our shared love for lacrosse and Stephen King, I often found myself forgetting that she was homeless. However, listening to Norena speak about the obstacles she faced on a daily basis brought me back to reality. When her family became homeless after losing their food cart, she could no longer afford to play the sport we both loved. The stress she faced as a result also caused her confidence and grades to drop. I realized that the effects of homelessness extend beyond the struggle for housing and security, yet there wasn't enough attention or resources given to homeless youth. Inspired by Norena's determination to empower others in the face of her own adversities, I became driven to address the lack of resources in shelters and bring awareness to the unheard stories of youth homelessness.After listening and gathering further stories from kids, I created a nonprofit called Kids First Project during my sophomore year that addresses their biggest challenge: the lack of educational and recreational programs. As I pondered how to bring programs directly to the kids in shelter, I realized that my classmates had power within their different interests and passions but no outlet to channel them into service-learning. By creating a platform for over 300 volunteers to lead free lacrosse workshops, poetry classes, mentoring and tutoring sessions, as well as other weekly programs in the eight shelters we serve, Kids First brings support to the kids in shelter and attention to the issue of youth homelessness, bridging the invisible divide. I will never forget the week Norena got back into housing and returned as a volunteer, an incredible moment where I knew that she had shown the younger kids that 'homeless' would never define them. She told me that beyond growing her passions through Kids First, she also found the confidence within herself to know that she can also empower others. Through the development of Kids First, listening to stories like Norena's evolved from a method of understanding the complexities of homelessness into the basis of my passion for driving innovative and meaningful change. And today, I continue to live by the lessons Norena taught me: to embrace the people around you, discover a reason to smile in every situation, and find purpose in compassion. As I go on to explore my interests within new groups and communities, I will continue to seek and amplify the stories of those around me, never allowing a person or a need to remain invisible.Last May I decided to take on leading Oregon's Global Youth Service Day, a feat that I knew was no simple task. At the time, I had been fixated on the idea of intersectionality within human rights, a realization that nothing is truly independent and every issue instead overlaps in constant flux. Aware that there were other youth-led initiatives addressing different needs outside of my nonprofit, Kids First Project, I wanted to host an Intersectionality Workshop as a way for all of us to support each other - the first ever event in my community where all the youth-led nonprofits would connect and collaborate for a common purpose.I gathered my Kids First Project team and Hope For Homeless Club members to reach out to as many youth-led nonprofits that we knew of. We ended up recruiting a total of five organizations that addressed issues ranging from gender inequality to human trafficking. Sharing the vision of intersectionality, we began meeting every week to plan the workshop and discuss the issues we worked on to find how all the issues were interrelated. Poverty and homelessness created a barrier between children and their ability to receive an education. Without schooling and resources, children - especially girls - are vulnerable to becoming victims of human trafficking. The day of the workshop, we each had our own booths followed by a related service-learning activity. After rotating through every workshop, we held a group panel discussion. Together, we found similarities among all the issues that had not been discussed before. The discussion led to the realization that a solution could in fact simultaneously address different issues if we looked toward the roots rather than the surface. It was incredible to see a simple vision come to life, where my excitement for intersectionality was not only shared in that one day, but also extended beyond the workshop. Today, it's not uncommon to see the youth-led nonprofits in Portland working together on initiatives and advocacy projects, highlighting the power of collective impact in creating change.",,,
276,Admitsee,3.5,1,2,,,,,"My lunch encompasses many colors. Hot Cheetos, cherry Jello, strawberry Gushers (all thanks to red #40).Orange Goldfish crackers, baby carrots, and a tangerine. Yellow, dairy-like cheese sticks and vanilla pudding. A sour Granny Smith apple with peanut butter, and juicy purple grapes from the backyard.  My mom helped me pack my first lunch as a kindergartnerbut expected me to follow the family tradition of packing my own lunch after that. I think my parents followed this advice from the Ann Landers' columns: 'It is not what you do for your children, but what you have taught them to do for themselves that will make them successful human beings.' Cleaning bathrooms, moving lumber, mowing the lawn, cooking a meal \u2014 we were taught with precision and clarity 'how to,' then it was up to us to do it independently. Lunches represented more than the joy of savory and sweet bites in my family; they represented a tradition of self-sufficiency that was valued in each stage of formation and education.  Yet one day in eighth grade I found myself with a different type of lunch. This lunch had been prepared by someone else\u2014with love and generosity that I greatly appreciated\u2014but it was not my own. I reached into the bag and began foraging for food: an apple, celery sticks, one-half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and, to top it off, a note that read, 'Our prayers are with you and your family.' I sat down on a school bench and couldn't help but break down.  My father was killed in a car accident in August of my eighth-grade year. A few hours after that pivotal and tragic collision, my older sister reminded me of the last time we were all together. We were at one of my swim meets, and my family was there to cheer me on, but they were also there simply to be together. She said, 'We're going to have to be like that more than ever now.' After we lost my dad, my friends and community instantly stepped in, packing me lunches that I didn't want and asking me what my favorite foods were. But I didn't want their food. I wanted to wake up and pack my own lunch, alongside the one person, my dad, who knew what it felt like to eat absurdly-colored, unhealthy snacks and still be skinny.   With my dad gone and my older siblings married, it was just my mom, my younger brother, and me at home. I became the guardian of our home, the one who entered the house first and put gas in the car at night. It was hard to go from the protected to the protector in just a day.Through it all, one thing gave me great comfort: my bag filled with Hot Cheetos, yogurt, fruit snacks, and cookies. Each bite fed a new and unbridled curiosity for how the world works. Whether I was researching treatments for chronic immune deficiencies by isolating proteins in human colostrum, striking up conversations with FFA members throughout the state and nation, or advocating for the continued protection of California's natural resources, I found that my curiosity was fueled not by the food I ate, but by the strength and self-sufficiency that I learned on that first day of kindergarten.   Because I stand at a slender 6' 4' with thick brown hair, I am often told that I bear a striking resemblance to my dad. Beyond my physical appearance, I hope to carry on his legacy through my zeal for learning, fearlessness in the face of failure, and above all, appreciation for good food and hard work. I look forward to diving into my next challenge and opportunity, college. I am going to pack my own lunch, complete with the sweet and savory memories of a vibrant family life, strength in triumphantly overcoming obstacles, and an unrivaled self-sufficiency.",,,

282,Admitsee,3.5,,2,,,,,"I've known from a young age that I wanted to work in medicine, and innovation drives the field christened by Asclepius. I joined my school's Health Occupation Students of America club in my sophomore year to be among other hopeful physicians. Members of the club choose one event and compete in it at various levels, depending on success in the previous levels. My event is a five-minute group presentation of a groundbreaking medical innovation, and in my first year competing, I killed it. In my second year, it killed me.      After wrangling up a group, we chose the \\\u2018medical innovation' event on a whim, and we certainly never expected to go as far as we did. My public speaking is incredibly poor; I had to memorize my speech to the letter and recite it in monotone. My hands shook and my voice wavered as I talked on the benefits and disadvantages of targeted cancer therapy. The judges must have seen something in us though, because we placed first at regionals, first at state, and third at nationals. In retrospect, I should have known that placing nationally against a hundred teams would inflate my ego and make failure inevitable. But winning was so empowering that I needed to do it again; adrenaline and arrogance fueled me for weeks afterwards.      But when junior year came and we were to sign up for our events again, something felt different. My new team still tried incredibly hard; we put more hours into this short presentation than we had of any project or class in the past. The topic of our presentation was a new and truly innovative approach to stem cells, a technique devised to create stem cells from adult cells, not embryonic cells. But come the state competition, our best efforts just weren't enough. We were missing a member and the presentation was disjointed. My nerves caused my voice to shake and stutter. Of the five groups receiving honorable mention, we did not place. It might not technically be a failure, but it was no success. I had expected the world and came away with nothing.     After my loss I was disappointed in myself and resentful towards my team. It didn't help that the rest of my school's chapter was dripping in gold. I had secretly been planning my return trip to nationals, and when I knew it would not come to fruition, I felt defeated. Instead of my vision of fine tuning an epic presentation and confidently strutting on to a stage to receive gold, I saw myself bored and sweltering at home all summer, with no goal to reach and no way to occupy my mountains of free time. I felt like I had reached the end of my line.      In the midst of my wallowing I applied for a summer job at the municipal pool. I worked there for the summer as a cashier and slide monitor, and I gained two things HOSA could never have given me: cash to spend and a tan to flaunt. I learned how to work with people who aren't highly driven students or teachers banking on my success, but regular people just trying to create a fun summer memory with their kids. It took me away from my obsession with academics and brought me into the world of work, where no one is concerned with grades, ACT scores or medical profession competitions.      From my success and subsequent loss at the same competitive event I learned something I had heard from my father my whole life: you win some, you lose some. Winston Churchill put it more eloquently when he described success as 'stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.' I learned that some things I hold so highly aren't the end all. I also know now that no one will hold you to one failure, but everyone loathes a sore loser.",,,
283,Admitsee,3.5,1,2,,,5,,"Come in, mamalah!' I timidly followed Mrs. Solomon into the kitchen, where I was engulfed by the smell of brisket and potatoes. As I stepped into the crowded dining room, my heart racing and my palms sweaty, I was overwhelmed with hugs and kisses from strangers. Trying not to attract too much attention to myself, I quietly sat down at the dinner table. That evening, the Solomon family was hosting me at their home in Sydney, Australia for the Passover Seder.My decision to travel to Sydney during Passover for the World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships was anything but easy. I was torn between my sentimental attachment to observe the holiday at home, as I had always done, and my ambition to test my academic skills on an international stage.My 'Bubby' and 'Zadie' (Yiddish for grandmother and grandfather) host the Passover Seder every year. The entire house radiates with warmth from the ovens and fills with the scent of Bubby's culinary delights, including piping hot bowls of matzo ball soup and crispy potato kugel. The guest list is a kaleidoscope of quirky characters. Among them, my cousin 'Magic' Stu, Uncle Tat, who did a stint upstate, and his ex-wife Barbara who still makes a cameo at the Seder ten years after their divorce (they usually sit at opposite ends of the table\u2026scowling at each other).Upon qualifying for 'Worlds' and discovering the Passover conflict, I began to experience a whirlwind of mixed emotions. On the one hand was my abiding affection for my family's Seder, and on the other hand was the excitement and anticipation of the opportunity that awaited me halfway around the world. The sacrifices I had made to reach this achievement were considerable, and squandering this opportunity would have its own repercussions. I had to find the mettle to reconcile my emotions with my ambitions, accept a bit of anxiety and discomfort, and make the 9,000 mile trek. Could I do it? Taking this step felt a little like jumping off a cliff without knowing if there was warm water or hard rocks below.When my rational thinking returned, it dawned on me that I had overlooked a possible solution. So I located a Jewish family in Sydney, the Solomons, and invited myself to their Seder. My initial trepidation subsided as I began to notice the abundant commonalities between their customs and my own. Despite the absence of crazy ex-Aunt Barbara and brisket instead of Bubby's chicken, the camaraderie of the Solomon family and their traditions were immensely comforting to me. I left their house around midnight, after hours of laughter and storytelling. I felt complete, like I had filled the void of Bubby and Zadie's Seder.In Australia, I learned things about myself far more valuable than debate skills. The world is much larger than my Bubby's kitchen. As I go through life, I will have to sacrifice what is familiar and comfortable in order to pursue new challenges. Sometimes it will be necessary to take a leap of faith, and I now have the confidence to do so. I learned to see my strong family ties and rich traditions as a basis upon which to expand my horizons, rather than as a limitation. Ultimately, I am incredibly grateful to have had this opportunity to explore these facets of my identity.",,,
284,Admitsee,4,1,,,,5,,"When I was five, I learned a valuable lesson: make sure the toilet seat is down before sitting on it.I only realized my embarrassing mistake when I stood up and my pajamas were soaked. Although both the babysitter and my brother were home, I could not muster up the confidence to ask them for help with my drenched onesie. Growing up, the same juvenile attitude about not asking for help would often manifest itself. Whether it was having to ask for rides because my mom's visual impairment forced her to stop driving or seek out my math teachers when I struggled, it always felt uncomfortable to impose on others for assistance. My issue with asking for and accepting help seemed to be rooted in a self-righteous crusade for independence. However, at the heart of it, my quest stemmed from a fear that I was not in control of my life. My daily routine became dictated by what other people were doing and how my needs fit into their busy lives. I found the thought of my friends and teachers going out of their ways to accommodate me to be demoralizing, even when they were glad to help.Until high school, I noticed myself wavering between the merits and shortcomings of asking for help. On the one hand, I was grateful for the help I received when I asked for it. On the other, I am burdened by my childhood of asking for rides and being dependent. However, my attitude would change after watching Henderson, the middle school student from the neighboring town that I tutor and mentor on Saturday mornings, achieve honor roll recognition for the first time. I realized not only the positive impact I could have on others, but also the profound impact that helping them would have on me. The feeling of providing assistance satisfied what I had thought was an insatiable yearning to repay my childhood favors. In this sense, helping people became not just something that I do; helping people is something that I need to do, and something that I love doing.While the honor roll was certainly an achievement for Henderson, it felt like a victory for me too. I finally understood the power of aiding others, and it became apparent to me why so many people were eager to help me. It wasn't that they pitied me or were just doing me a favor; when they would give me a hand, they felt the same sense of gratification as I had when my student made the honor roll. In that regard, tutoring became my vehicle to offer Henderson scholastic rides. Perhaps the greatest thing that helping Henderson taught me, however, was that I want to dedicate my life to public service. The satisfaction that I feel from helping has become somewhat of an obsession for me; whether it is raising over $25,000 for the Foundation Fighting Blindness or traveling to Vietnam to build houses, offering an outstretched hand is my passion. I believe that there is no professional career that holds a higher ability to help people than being a politician. In reality, the everyday decisions that lawmakers make could potentially have a meaningful impact on not only the citizens of the United States but also everyone globally. Henderson doesn't know it, but he inadvertently inspired my career choice. I would like to be a political leader so that I can make a difference in everybody's lives. Eleven years ago, I failed to put the toilet seat down and ask for assistance. Yet only from my insistence on independence would I, later on, realize the virtue of help. Now, whenever I leave the bathroom, I always make sure the toilet seat is down to help others avoid the same unfortunate mistake I made in my youth.",,,
285,Admitsee,3.5,1,,,,5,,"These are terrible,' I mutter as I cross out another couple of lines. 'Nobody would listen to this song.' Another fruitless brainstorming session, stuck at the piano with chord progressions and key signatures running through my head\u2014but no words. It makes no sense. Just merely sitting down at a Yamaha or Steinway is enough to fill my mind to the brim with syncopations and arpeggios, which my hands quickly convert to notes on the keyboard. Nevertheless, for all of the music surrounding my life, I cannot write the right words for a worthy original composition. To explain why I am in such a dilemma, I must first elaborate on my musical history. Music has been one of the greatest influences throughout my life. For about as long as I can remember, I have been trained in classical piano. Normally kids younger than second grade do not take lessons, but somehow my parents sweet-talked the teacher into giving me a chance when I was only in kindergarten. Unfortunately, I was not one of those childhood prodigies, nor did I have perfect pitch. I did have one thing going for me though: I was raised to appreciate music. My dad was a country music enthusiast, my mother played some saxophone, and they played 'Jazz Nightly' on National Public Radio as I fell asleep each night. This appreciation drove my determination to be good at piano. Two hours of practice a night, every night\u2014that is what it took to move up just one skill level each year. Now, twelve years later, every one of those painstaking hours has paid off, and my piano skills are not too shabby. Slightly easier was choral music. My love for singing came mostly from my father, who, as I mentioned earlier, has an ear for country music. This held true for both the genre and for the literal country where we live. One of my earliest memories is singing 'God Bless the USA' by Lee Greenwood with my dad for a Veteran's Day program. That Christmas, he deployed to Iraq with the Army National Guard. I was in first grade. Another of my earliest memories is going home after watching him fly out and singing that song to myself until I was hoarse. That is exactly how I have approached singing ever since: applying myself fully and truly understanding the emotion behind the words I am saying. Between extensive experience in both piano and vocal music, I should have the experience and knowledge necessary to compose my own piece of music. Employing every tactic learned through music, I continue to strive toward this goal; I practice nearly every night, and the emotional connection is always real. I have poured hundreds of hours into this project, yet I feel as though I am not making any progress. Why is there no progress? I think that the answer is quite simple: I do not know everything about music. Think of music as a language. We must learn to read, speak, and write English. Well, I have already learned how to read and speak music\u2014but not how to write it. My mistaken assumption was that the first two facets would automatically make me fluent in the third. The words are all there, and I know how to say them, but now I must begin learning how to use them in a completely new way. It will not be one great discovery or revelation but rather a slow gathering of understanding. Practice makes perfect, and I just have not had enough practice yet. I am sure that someday the words will finally organize themselves just the right way. I will smile and whisper to myself, 'I think that's a decent place to start.'",,,
286,Admitsee,4,1,2,3,,,,"I have to do it. I inched closer to the door, each movement made with increasing hesitation. What if it's just like last time? My mind launched into a frenzy of self-degrading hypothetical situations, all of which ended in defeat. I couldn't back down. Not again. Adrenaline rushing through my body, I took a deep breath and turned the cold, shiny doorknob.I could have began with a simple 'hello' or a friendly 'what's up?'Instead, I opened with a joke I had found on the back of a Laffy Taffy wrapper, something I expected to be a sure-fire hit: 'Why was the cat afraid of the tree? Because of its bark!'I looked around at the other children in the room, awaiting a response that never came. They shrugged, looked down, and continued to shove rosogolla and pani puri into their mouths. My apprehensions proven true, I returned to my isolated corner in the room across the hall, fidgeting with an unsolved Rubik's cube.I was twelve years old, and failing to make friends my age at Bangladeshi dinner parties had become the norm. Failing to make friends anywhere had become the norm.Growing up, I tottered between my Bangladeshi and American identities. I struggled to find friends similar to myself because I hadn't yet understood who I was. I was too Bangladeshi for Americans, and too American for Bangladeshis. I felt an obligation to wholly conform to one group, one that wasn't entirely me. Everything changed, however, when I picked up a copy of The Velvet Underground & Nico from the five-dollar bin at an electronics store. I found the cover visually appealing, so I listened in hopes of it being sonically appealing as well. From that moment on, I became hooked\u2014not only on the Velvet Underground, but on indie music as a whole.In the midst of my internal conflict, indie music's individualistic platform lured me in. The music was characterized by the musicians' relentless ambition to break out of the confinement of everyday life, just as I craved to break free from conformity. As I became increasingly engrossed in the culture surrounding indie music, I became increasingly unconstrained in my attitude and my thinking. I found refuge. I was different, and I liked it.My burgeoning appreciation for indie music sparked a new sense of curiosity in me. It began with basic questions and progressed into more insightful ones:'What if the artist put this note next to that one instead?''How would the meaning of this song change if the artist used that instrument instead?''How would this song play out if it had been written ten years earlier or ten years later?' I learned to play the guitar and the piano so I could meticulously craft my own simple yet intricate compositions, emulating those of the Strokes. Radiohead's profound lyricism exposed me to complex ideologies like existentialism and political corruption, which I began to ponder for myself. Through exploring Car Seat Headrest's lyrical allusions to literary works and histories such as Ovid's Metamorphoses and the life of William Butler Yeats, I reflected on both the mundanities and complexities of life. I spent late nights with a Portuguese-English dictionary after listening to Rodrigo Amarante, trying to comprehend each bit of the beautiful language. I delved into the the mathematics behind music and analyzed algorithms and patterns used in LCD Soundsystem's songs. Indie music shaped my approach on everything I did, in academics and beyond.Indie music not only allowed me to express my identity but also influenced it on a fundamental level. My fascination with the genre and the culture surrounding it has shaped my personality and allowed me to grow into the best version of myself. It transformed me from a tense, apprehensive child into a free-thinking individual who can illuminate any room with enlightening eccentricity.",,,

Suddenly, an incessant downpour of raindrops bombards the window in a succession of percussive beats. An unsettling feeling intrudes on my train of thought, and my eyes glance towards my watch: 2:18 AM. A tinge of guilt tugs at my conscience; I have to catch the 6:46 AM train for my two-hour commute to the lab. I feel my eyelids growing heavier, my alertness ebbing away...Torrents of rain pummel the thatch roof as a young boy huddles beneath the schoolhouse window, tightly clutching a copy of Essential English Book I.A brisk voice floats through the window: 'Krom kruosaear: family. F-A-M-I-L-Y.'A chorus of voices follow: 'F-A-M-I-L-Y. Family.'The young boy traces the letters on the page with his finger, then repeats: 'Fah-mee-lee.'He stares longingly at the sign outside the schoolhouse: '\u200eEnglish class: \u0e3f150 per month'. But his pockets are bare, as is his stomach; he has sold his fruit rations for money to buy English textbooks, so he can follow along with the class.I grew up hearing Dad's stories of his turbulent childhood in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge regime. Orphaned at age ten and forced into a grueling labor camp, he escaped the Killing Fields through landmine-laced jungles, foraging for snakes and tarantulas to survive, until reaching the Khao I Dang Refugee Camp. Several years later, he arrived in the U.S., went on to obtain an electrical engineering degree, and became a successful software consultant. I often struggle to imagine the cruel world my dad grew up in. He often reminds me that in his darkest days, he treasured opportunities for learning\u2014they gave him hope for a better future. He's instilled in me that education is a privilege; knowledge holds the key to a better world. Every day, I strive to make him proud, selecting rigorous academic courses while actively pursuing challenging experiences to nourish my thirst for knowledge.Last summer, I stumbled across a TIME 100 article about groundbreaking Alzheimer's disease research pioneered by Dr. Rudolph Tanzi. 7 years ago, Alzheimer's took the life of my beloved grandpa\u2014 my dad's foster father. The idea of conducting cutting-edge research at a world-renowned laboratory, exploring and innovating for the future, and contributing to the mission for a cure to Alzheimer's, captivated me. Promptly, I wrote Dr. Tanzi a letter.Day 1 at the Tanzi lab. The words of my mentor, Dr. Li, echoed through my mind: 'Don't worry, you're only in high school. We don't expect you to understand how everything works.' These words were probably intended as reassurance; instead, they initiated a challenge to me: to understand EVERYTHING.I spent many nights furiously probing Bitesize Bio for answers, taking notes off JoVE demonstrations of fly dissections, and scrutinizing research publications to gain a thorough understanding of the experiments. By my second week at the lab, I'd independently performed my first western blot.'This is incredible!' Dr. Li exclaimed. 'For weeks we've been trying to capture 3D confocal images on Nikon Elements. 3D-imaging will be invaluable for our future publications\u2014wow, look at those Candida glabrata being engulfed by the THP-1 macrophages!'Dr Li's encouragement inspired me to continue researching at home, seeking ways to optimize procedures and improve our experiments.Scribbling furiously on my notebook, a blissful tingle of magic courses through my body. I've found the answer. It's been a weary day, but an inexplicable joy electrifies me, my spirit soaring. Suddenly, a vivid image of the little boy flashes through my mind: his stomach empty, but his heart full of hope, his mind full of curiosity: wholly enchanted by the magic of learning. Nestled in a mountain of blankets, my face illuminated by the soft glow of my laptop, I peer out towards the window, where the pounding rain has abated to a drizzle, waltzing in its misty descent.",,,

298,Admitsee,4,1,2,,,5,,"The piranhas won't come after you as long as you keep swimming!'My bare feet stayed safely planted on the floor of the canoe. If there was one thing that my sixteen year old self remembered from third grade science, it was that las pira\u00f1as are the most dangerous species of fish in the Amazon River. The fact that I was in a canoe at all, spending five days in the Amazon jungle, was astounding. For weeks beforehand, I had agonized over whether this trip was worth it. Luckily, Mayela, my Peruvian host mom, was a sympathetic listener as I rattled off a list of imagined fears and worst-case scenarios.What if I got bitten by a rabies-infected bat in my sleep? What if the recommended twenty-eight malaria pills in that skinny orange bottle gave me terrible side effects? What if I found tarantulas in my sleeping quarters? What if I got hurt? Lost? What if I regretted going?I can hear Mayela's soothing voice in my head to this day- no te preocupes, don't worry. As the deadline for registration crept closer, I channeled the panic into lists of pros and cons. At the last minute, I decided that I couldn't refuse this opportunity to see a part of the world my ten year old self had only read about in Britannica Online. I walked out the front door with my duffel bag in hand, ignoring the pit in my stomach. That is how I ended up standing on the edge of a canoe in the middle of the Amazon River, debating whether or not I should throw myself into a body of water known to be inhabited by piranhas. I felt my feet leave the canoe before I even realized I had made the decision to jump. All doubts disappeared the second I was in the air. I heard the elated shouts of my friends, and when my head came up out of the cool water, I spotted a rainbow above the green horizon. Risk-taking was never one of my fortes. My decision to spend a year between tenth and eleventh grade in South America as an exchange student came as a shock to family and friends alike. 'Joy's going to Peru for a whole year?' It was a sort of rebellion against myself. I tried new foods like cow heart and guinea pig and performed a salsa routine in front of my school. I haggled with crooked taxi drivers and confronted those who assumed just by looking at me that I was everything but American. I rebelled against my timid and indecisive nature by jumping into piranha-filled waters on a daily basis.I eventually came to realize that the fear before the jump- whether it be a split-second moment or drawn-out eternity- is far worse than the actual leap. And though taking the leap may lead to a tiring swim to catch up with the boat, it will hardly ever lead to regret. I've learned from experience that not taking the leap is what leads to regret. Equipped with this newfound knowledge, I returned to the U.S. and dove headfirst into a sea of new endeavors. I designed a school-wide project to promote diversity and inclusiveness. I frequented the city to participate in social and political protests. I ran for class treasurer, lost, then became vice president and treasurer of my two favorite clubs. I have not suddenly been reborn a skilled and fearless risk-taker. In a room full of people, I am still not the one with the loudest voice, or the most outgoing. But beneath this quiet exterior is an adventurous spirit, not one to shy away from the unknown, from trying new things. So the next time I find myself in a crowded canoe, I will be the first to jump. The piranhas won't bother me as long as I keep moving.",,,
